        <p>Anterior mediastinal masses encompass a diverse group of neoplastic and nonneoplastic lesions located within the mediastinum, presenting a diagnostic challenge due to their varied etiologies and potential for serious complications. These masses can arise from thymic, germ cell, lymphoid, or thyroid tissues, among others. They may manifest with a wide range of clinical symptoms, including respiratory distress, chest pain, and superior vena cava syndrome. Diagnosis typically involves a combination of imaging modalities, tissue biopsies, and laboratory tests, with treatment strategies tailored to the specific underlying pathology, stage, and patient characteristics. Given the potential implications for patient outcomes, a multidisciplinary approach involving collaboration between clinicians, radiologists, pathologists, and other specialists is essential for accurate diagnosis, timely intervention, and optimal management of anterior mediastinal masses.</p>
        <p>Participating in this course allows clinicians to deepen their understanding of anterior mediastinal masses, including their pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management strategies.&#x000a0;Additionally, clinicians can expect to enhance their clinical decision-making skills, refine their diagnostic reasoning abilities, and improve their capacity to collaborate effectively within multidisciplinary healthcare teams. By staying abreast of current evidence-based practices and emerging trends in anterior mediastinal mass management, participants will be better equipped to deliver high-quality, patient-centered care, optimize patient outcomes, and ensure patient safety in clinical practice.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>The mediastinum is located between the lungs and houses vital structures, including the thymus, heart, major blood vessels, lymph nodes, nerves, and portions of the esophagus and trachea. Anteriorly, the sternum bounds the mediastinum, while the thoracic vertebrae define the posterior border. Superiorly, it extends to the thoracic inlet, while the diaphragm forms its inferior boundary. Laterally, the mediastinum is delineated by the pericardial and mediastinal pleurae, encompassing critical thoracic organs and structures. Mediastinal tumors account for 3% of all the tumors that arise in the thoracic cavity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>Comprising anterior, middle, and posterior compartments, mediastinal masses span a broad histopathological spectrum, with 50% occurring anteriorly. The most common anterior masses are often known by the 4T's: thymoma, teratoma, thyroid tissue, and 'terrible' lymphoma. These masses present unique challenges due to their proximity to critical thoracic structures. While imaging advancements aid characterization, accurate diagnosis often requires a multimodal approach integrating radiology, histology, and molecular techniques. Management considerations encompass histopathology, patient factors, and tumor biology. This article comprehensively reviews clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and therapeutic interventions for anterior mediastinal masses, addressing recent advancements and controversies.</p>

      <sec id="article-17651.s3" sec-type="Etiology">
        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>The anterior mediastinum, positioned in front of the heart and bounded by the sternum, undergoes significant changes from childhood to adulthood. In children, the mediastinum houses the large thymus, a vital immune organ; in adults, it transitions to a smaller space as thymic function diminishes and the gland involutes. This evolution leaves behind an area susceptible to tumor formation. In addition to thymic tissue, the anterior mediastinum contains fat and lymph nodes, all corresponding with the most common etiologies of associated primary tumors. Although two-thirds of mediastinal masses are benign, about 59% of masses in the anterior compartment are malignant.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Predominantly, anterior mediastinal masses consist of epithelial tumors.</p>
        <p>Thymoma, constituting less than 1% of adult malignancies, is the most commonly occurring anterior mediastinal mass in adults.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Benign masses of thymic origin are rare but include thymolipomas characterized by adipose composition and thymic cysts. Thymic cysts may be congenital, representing remnants of the thymopharyngeal duct, or acquired as a manifestation of an inflammatory neoplasm like Hodgkin lymphoma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;In contrast, thymic masses may occasionally manifest as aggressive and invasive neoplasms, such as thymic carcinoma and thymic carcinoid. Distinguishing these from thymic hyperplasia is crucial, with hyperplasia further classified into true and lymphoid (follicular) types. True thymic hyperplasia involves an enlarged thymus with the retained original shape and is often associated with stress-inducing factors like chemotherapy, burns, or corticosteroid administration. On the other hand, lymphoid thymic hyperplasia is characterized by an increased number of lymphoid follicles and is commonly linked to autoimmune conditions such as myasthenia gravis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;In rare instances, a thymic mass may be ectopic parathyroid tissue, adding to the complexity of differential diagnoses.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Germ cell tumors (GCTs) are characterized by primitive germ cells that fail to migrate entirely during embryonic development. While typically originating in the gonads, they represent 15% of anterior mediastinal masses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Among GCTs, benign teratomas are most common, comprising tissues from at least 2 germ layers. Teratomas may contain ectodermic tissue, like hair and teeth, and tissues derived from mesoderm (bone) and endoderm (intestinal epithelium). If teratomas contain fetal or neuroendocrine tissue, they are classified as immature and malignant and carry a poor prognosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Seminomas and nonseminomatous GCTs (NSGCTs) are rare malignant GCTs, often presenting as large, bulky masses. Seminomas, representing 25% to 50% of malignant GCTs, may exhibit normal alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels but mildly elevated beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (&#x003b2;-hCG).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Conversely, NSGCTs, comprising yolk sac tumors, embryonal carcinomas, choriocarcinomas, and mixed GCTs, are commonly associated with elevated AFP and &#x003b2;-hCG.</p>
        <p>Primary mediastinal lymphomas represent approximately 10% of all mediastinal lymphomas.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) accounts for 50% to 70% of primary lymphomas and is classified into subtypes, including nodular sclerosing (the most common), lymphocyte-rich, lymphocyte-depleted, and mixed-cellularity. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) constitutes 15% to 25% of primary lymphomas, with the predominant types being primary mediastinal large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (PMBCL) and lymphoblastic non-Hodgkin lymphoma (LB-NHL), most commonly T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (TLL).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>Enlarged thyroid glands, or goiters, can occasionally manifest as anterior mediastinal masses. Substernal goiters, constituting a significant proportion, are characterized by at least 50% of their volume below the thoracic inlet. Typically, mediastinal goiters arise from the extension of lower cervical thyroid lobes into the thoracic inlet. In rarer cases, mediastinal goiters may result from remnants of embryonic tissues.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Ectopic thyroid tissue, defined as a location of thyroid tissue at a certain distance from the 2nd to 4th tracheal cartilages, resulting from an abnormality in embryological development or migration of the gland into the anterior mediastinum, accounts for 1% of all mediastinal masses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Less common origins of anterior mediastinal masses encompass parathyroid adenomas (approximately 20% are ectopic and can be found within the anterior mediastinum), hemangiomas, and sarcomas. Fibrosing mediastinitis, marked by the gradual infiltration of fibrous tissue, represents another uncommon etiology. This condition may arise from various sources, including infections like tuberculosis and histoplasmosis, as well as reactions to autoimmune disorders, medications, and radiation exposure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r7">[7]</xref></p>

        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>The most frequent etiologies of anterior mediastinal masses are thymic malignancies in&#x000a0;about 35% and lymphoma in&#x000a0;about 25% (HL, 13% and NHL, 12%). Less common causes of anterior mediastinal masses are thyroid and other endocrine tumors (15%), benign teratoma (10%), malignant&#x000a0;GCTs&#x000a0;(10% with seminomas about 4% and NSGCT about 7%), and benign thymic lesions (5%).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;When evaluating the epidemiology of anterior mediastinal masses, patient age and sex are the most important determinants.</p>
        <p>For men and women older than 40, thyroid goiter and thymic malignancies represent two-thirds of anterior mediastinal masses. Between&#x000a0;30%&#x000a0;to 50% of patients with thymomas will have an associated paraneoplastic syndrome, the most common of which is MG (30-50% of thymoma patients develop MG, while thymomas are discovered in 10-30% of MG patients), followed by hypogammaglobulinemia and pure red cell aplasia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;Notably, various autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, colitis, and myocarditis may also be associated with thymoma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r11">[11]</xref></p>
        <p>The most common proportion of mediastinal masses in females&#x000a0;aged 10 to 39 are lymphomas, typically&#x000a0;HL and PMBCL.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Importantly, HL has a classic bimodal distribution of incidence, which peaks in young adulthood and&#x000a0;older than 50. The next most common etiologies of anterior mediastinal masses in this population are thymic malignancies, often present in women older than 20, and benign teratomas, which are more prevalent in females younger than 25.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <p>In contrast, men 10 to 39 years, as well as children younger than 10, have no dominant tumor type of the anterior mediastinum.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;The diagnosis of anterior mediastinal mass in these populations largely relies on the rapidity&#x000a0;in which symptoms manifest, with a&#x000a0;rapid onset of symptoms suggestive of LB-NHL, an intermediate onset HL or PMBCL, and a chronic onset of other tumors such as teratoma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r8">[8]</xref></p>

        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>Many patients with mediastinal masses may not exhibit any symptoms. However, the severity of symptoms can vary depending on factors such as the location of the mass and the extent of compression or invasion of nearby structures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r1">[1]</xref> Compression or involvement of mediastinal structures by these masses can lead to a diverse range of symptoms, including cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, pain, dysphagia, stridor, hoarseness, facial swelling, arm swelling, hypotension due to cardiac compression, and neurologic changes such as Horner syndrome.</p>
        <p>Additionally, systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss may be present, particularly in lymphoma cases or due to paraneoplastic syndromes, such as MG, associated with thymoma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;Furthermore, malignant tumors have the potential not only to compress or obstruct nearby structures but also invade them, leading to complications such as pneumonia, superior vena cava syndrome, broncho-esophageal fistula, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and various neurologic abnormalities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r12">[12]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r13">[13]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r14">[14]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-17651.s6" sec-type="Histopathology">
        <title>Histopathology</title>
        <p>Mediastinal tumors pose significant challenges for surgical pathologists due to several factors. First, the diversity of lesions occurring in this location necessitates consideration of a broad range of differential diagnoses. Second, biopsies frequently yield small, fragmented specimens, further complicating interpretation. Third, pathologists with extensive experience in mediastinal pathology are relatively scarce due to the rarity of specimens from this region.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r12">[12]</xref></p>
        <p>Given the overlapping histologic features of many mediastinal tumors, a thorough evaluation of each specimen, often involving ancillary testing, is essential. Differential therapy approaches for various mediastinal tumors can significantly affect patient survival, underscoring the importance of accurate diagnosis. Furthermore, distinguishing whether a tumor originates from the mediastinum or adjacent lung or represents metastasis to the mediastinum is critical.</p>
        <p>The following is the basic histology found in the most common tumors of the anterior mediastinum:</p>
        <p>
<bold>Thymomas</bold>
</p>
        <p>Thymomas exhibit a distinct lobulated architecture composed of cellular lobules containing neoplastic epithelial cells and reactive thymocytes intersected by fibrous bands. Many thymomas are encapsulated to some extent. The World Health Organization's (WHO) morphological classification of thymomas considers the shape of epithelial tumor cells, the tumor cell-to-thymocyte ratio, and cytologic atypia. Various growth patterns, such as microcystic changes, storiform growth, and staghorn-shaped vessels, can be observed, particularly in type A and AB thymomas or micronodular thymomas with lymphoid stroma. Prominent plasma cell infiltrates, microcystic patterns, and myoid cells (rhabdomyomatous thymoma) are also noted. Dilated perivascular spaces filled with plasma fluid, lymphocytes, and foamy macrophages are characteristic of type B1, B2, and B3 thymomas. Hassall corpuscles and a "starry-sky" pattern are additional histologic features seen in thymomas.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r15">[15]</xref></p>
        <p>Distinguishing between type B1 and B2 thymomas can be challenging. Type B1 thymomas contain areas of medullary differentiation without clustering of epithelial cells, while type B2 thymomas feature more clustered epithelial cells. Type B1 thymomas may resemble small lymphocytic lymphomas, but keratin stains aid in recognizing the epithelial meshwork. Type B3 thymomas, and occasionally type A or atypical A thymomas, may be confused with thymic carcinomas or metastatic squamous cell carcinomas due to distorted architecture. Thymomas can exhibit extensive cystic changes or be associated with thymic cysts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r15">[15]</xref></p>

<bold>Germ Cell Tumors&#x000a0;</bold>

        <p>Mediastinal GCTs have histology similar to those found in ovaries and testes.</p>

          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Immature: Malignant GCT comprises cells from the 3 germ layers and contains variable amounts of mature and immature tissue (typically primitive neuroectodermal). Immature teratomas typically exhibit islands of poorly differentiated (primitive), immature, and blast-like cells. Among these cells, the neuroectodermal elements are often predominant and relatively easier to identify and quantify. Immature neuroectodermal tissues in immature teratomas include islets and nests of neuroblasts, hypercellular and mitotically active immature glia, and primitive, melanic pigmented retinal tissue. Additionally, benign vascular proliferations may occasionally accompany neural elements, which can sometimes lead to confusion with a vascular tumor.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r16">[16]</xref></p>

          <list-item>
            <p>Unlike other epithelial tumors such as embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, or choriocarcinoma, the neoplastic cells in seminoma are typically less cohesive. Additionally, clusters of lymphocytes are commonly observed in close association with the tumor cells.</p>

The cells typically appear polygonal, with crowded arrangements, indistinct cell borders, and overlapping nuclei. They exhibit moderate amphophilic and granular cytoplasm and display pleomorphic, high-grade nuclear features. Mitotic figures are common, smudgy degenerative nuclei are often seen, and necrosis is present in single cells and larger foci.</p>

                <p>Embryonal carcinoma may grow admixed with yolk sac tumor and occasionally form polyembryoma-like structures known as embryoid bodies. Residual seminiferous tubules may contain germ cell neoplasia in situ or intratubular embryonal carcinoma, which can fill the tubule entirely. Lymphovascular invasion is common within embryonal carcinoma-predominant GCTs, often visualized at the periphery of the testicle and capable of occluding vessels, mimicking tumor nodules.</p>

Syncytiotrophoblasts are large, multinucleated cells with abundant, dense, eosinophilic cytoplasm and indistinct cell borders. They possess pleomorphic, hyperchromatic nuclei that may exhibit a degenerated, smudged appearance. These cells often grow over mononucleated trophoblasts, forming either a thin compressed rim or a thicker cap. Mononucleated trophoblasts, comprising cytotrophoblasts and intermediate trophoblasts, are medium-sized cells with pale, eosinophilic cytoplasm and distinct cell borders.

        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>In evaluating anterior mediastinal masses, clinicians should conduct a thorough history and physical examination to identify symptoms and signs associated with these masses. Factors such as age and sex can aid in formulating a differential diagnosis, as the prevalence of mediastinal mass subtypes may vary among demographics. Reviewing the time course of symptom development or their absence can help narrow down potential diagnoses, considering that mediastinal processes may exhibit slow or rapid growth. Additionally, mediastinal masses might be associated with abnormalities in other body parts, necessitating a comprehensive review of systems during history-taking.</p>
        <p>
<bold>History&#x000a0;</bold>
</p>
        <p>The diagnosis of anterior mediastinal mass may be an incidental finding in a patient who is asymptomatic; however, 60% of patients are symptomatic at presentation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r21">[21]</xref>&#x000a0;Inquire about symptoms such as cough, chest pain, dyspnea, voice changes (hoarseness), hemoptysis, and dysphagia, as these symptoms may indicate compression or invasion of surrounding structures. Constitutional symptoms like fever, night sweats, or unintentional weight loss (B symptoms) are classically observed in lymphoma but can also occur with other malignancies. Systemic complaints such as ptosis, dysphagia, weakness, abdominal pain, altered mental status, and fatigue can be manifestations of a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with an anterior mediastinal mass.</p>
        <p>Assessing the rapidity of symptom onset is critical for determining the tumor's aggressiveness. Rapidly developing symptoms often indicate aggressive tumors like lymphoma or GCTs, whereas a more gradual onset may suggest slower-growing tumors such as thymomas or teratomas. Discuss any related medical conditions, such as previous malignancies, autoimmune disorders, or infections, that could provide clues to the etiology of the mediastinal mass. Also, document all current medications, including any immunosuppressive or hormonal therapies, noting allergies to medications or contrast agents for diagnostic imaging. Ask about a family history of cancer, autoimmune diseases, or genetic syndromes that might predispose the patient to mediastinal masses. Inquire about potential occupational or environmental exposures to toxins, radiation, or chemicals that could contribute to the development of mediastinal masses.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Physical Examination</bold>
</p>
        <p>The physical examination encompasses various aspects crucial for evaluating patients with anterior mediastinal masses&#x02014;including assessing the patient's overall appearance for signs of distress or systemic illness, recording vital signs, and conducting specific examinations of different body systems. Each physical examination component provides valuable information to guide further diagnostic and management strategies for patients with anterior mediastinal masses.</p>
        <p>Begin the exam by recording vital signs to assess for signs of infection or cardiovascular compromise. Assess the patient's appearance for signs of distress, cachexia (weight loss and muscle wasting), or pallor, which may indicate systemic illness. Look for lymphadenopathy, which may suggest metastatic spread or lymphoma. Evaluate the head and neck for proptosis, periorbital and facial edema, proptosis, facial plethora, and jugular venous distention, indicating superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r22">[22]</xref>&#x000a0;Auscultate the lungs for abnormal breath sounds, which could indicate underlying lung pathology or pleural effusion. Listen for abnormal heart sounds, murmurs, or pericardial rubs suggesting pericardial involvement or cardiac compression by the mediastinal mass. Palpate the abdomen for organomegaly or masses, as some anterior mediastinal masses can cause abdominal symptoms or be associated with metastases. Assess cranial nerves for signs of Horner syndrome (unilateral ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis) or other neurological deficits that may indicate neural structure involvement.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r23">[23]</xref>&#x000a0;Check for peripheral edema, especially in the upper extremities and face, which can occur with SVC syndrome. Look for signs of dermatological conditions or cutaneous manifestations of systemic diseases that could be associated with the mediastinal mass. Perform a scrotal examination in males to assess for testicular masses, as some mediastinal tumors can be associated with GCTs. Notably, in men, gynecomastia may occur from the release of &#x003b2;-human chorionic gonadotropin, as is common with NSGCTs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>

<bold>Radiological Studies</bold>
</p>
        <p>Radiological studies play a crucial role in diagnosing anterior mediastinal masses by providing detailed anatomical information, assessing the extent of the mass, and guiding further management decisions. Several radiological modalities are commonly used or associated with the evaluation of these masses:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p><bold>Chest x-ray:</bold>&#x000a0;A chest x-ray (CXR) is often the initial imaging study performed and may reveal the presence of a mediastinal mass, its location, size, and any associated pulmonary abnormalities. While CXR provides an overview, it lacks detailed mass characterization and may require further imaging for definitive diagnosis (see&#x000a0;<bold>Image.</bold>&#x000a0;Anterior Mediastinal Mass on Chest X-ray).</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><bold>Computed tomography scan:</bold>&#x000a0;This imaging is the cornerstone for evaluating anterior mediastinal masses due to its high spatial resolution and ability to delineate soft tissue structures. Computed tomography (CT) scans can provide detailed information about the mass's size, location, morphology, density, and relationship to adjacent structures such as the heart, great vessels, and lungs (see&#x000a0;<bold>Image.</bold>&#x000a0;Anterior Mediastinal Mass on Chest Computed Tomography). Additionally, contrast-enhanced CT scans can help differentiate between solid and cystic components within the mass, assess vascular involvement, and detect metastases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;For example, a thymoma will appear as a slightly heterogeneous mass with smooth or lobular margins. At the same time, a teratoma is typically cystic and contains varying amounts of fat, soft tissue, and calcification. CT helps characterize lesions and aids with staging disease processes (eg, a mediastinal lymph node enlargement merits special attention). The presence of pleural or pericardial effusions also requires assessment, as this can clue the physician into the diagnosis of lymphoma or NSGCTs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r3">[3]</xref></p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><bold>Magnetic resonance imaging:</bold>&#x000a0;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is beneficial for evaluating mediastinal masses in cases where CT findings are equivocal or when soft tissue characterization is paramount. MRI provides excellent soft tissue contrast resolution and can help differentiate between various tissue types within the mass, such as fat, fluid, and solid components. One example is distinguishing thymic hyperplasia from thymic malignancy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;A thymic neoplasm may appear as a focal, nodular mass with a necrotic and calcified center, while thymic hyperplasia will be smooth and symmetric in morphology. Additionally, MRI helps confirm the presence of fat, which is more suggestive of thymic hyperplasia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;MRI is also especially valuable for assessing neural and vascular involvement, evaluating spinal cord compression, and detecting intraspinal extension of the mass.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><bold>Positron emission tomography scan:</bold>&#x000a0;Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, often performed in conjunction with CT (PET-CT), is valuable for assessing the metabolic activity of mediastinal masses and detecting distant metastases. PET-CT scans can help differentiate between benign and malignant lesions, guide biopsy or surgical planning, and monitor treatment response in patients with mediastinal malignancies. This is a valuable modality for staging lymphomas, as it is more accurate at detecting intranodal and extranodal disease than CT.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r2">[2]</xref></p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><bold>Ultrasound:</bold>&#x000a0;While less commonly used for evaluating mediastinal masses, ultrasound (US) may be employed for initial assessment or guidance during biopsy procedures, particularly in pediatric patients or when radiation exposure needs to be minimized. The US can provide real-time visualization of the mass and adjacent structures, assess vascularity, and facilitate targeted sampling of suspicious lesions.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><bold>Fluorodeoxyglucose PET-CT:&#x000a0;</bold>This imaging is sensitive for detecting hypermetabolic activity associated with malignant mediastinal masses and helps assess the mass's metabolic activity, identify areas of increased glucose metabolism suggestive of malignancy, and stage the disease by detecting distant metastases or lymph node involvement.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>In addition to the standard radiological studies, specific imaging tests may be necessary for certain etiologies of anterior mediastinal masses to characterize the lesion and guide management decisions further:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p><bold>Scintigraphy with radioactive iodine:</bold>&#x000a0;This imaging modality is valuable when evaluating a mediastinal goiter suspected of containing active thyroid tissue. Radioactive iodine uptake studies can help identify functioning thyroid tissue within the mass, aiding in diagnosing the retrosternal extension of a substernal goiter.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><bold>Nuclear scans with isotopes, such as technetium-99:</bold>&#x000a0;These are indicated when a mediastinal parathyroid adenoma is suspected. Technetium-99m sestamibi scintigraphy helps localize parathyroid adenomas, which may present as anterior mediastinal masses due to ectopic glandular tissue.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><bold>Testicular US:</bold>&#x000a0;All male patients with a mediastinal GCT should undergo testicular US as part of a comprehensive workup for primary gonadal malignancy. This test helps identify concurrent testicular lesions, assess the contralateral testis, and guide management decisions regarding testicular-sparing surgery or orchidectomy.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><bold>Pulmonary function tests:</bold>&#x000a0;These tests are essential for all patients with anterior mediastinal masses to assess lung function and identify any obstructive or restrictive pulmonary abnormalities. While spirometry is typically normal, pulmonary function tests may reveal a flattening of the inspiratory flow loop on the flow-volume curve in cases of variable extrathoracic obstruction caused by the mediastinal tumor. This finding can help evaluate the degree of airway compromise and guide preoperative assessment and postoperative management planning.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>By incorporating these additional imaging modalities and tests into the diagnostic workup of anterior mediastinal masses, clinicians can obtain comprehensive information to diagnose the underlying pathology accurately, assess the extent of the disease, and optimize treatment strategies tailored to individual patients' needs.</p>
        <p>Overall, the choice of radiological studies depends on the clinical presentation, suspected underlying pathology, and specific questions to be addressed. When interpreted in conjunction with clinical and histopathological data, radiological findings play a crucial role in establishing an accurate diagnosis, determining the extent of the disease, and guiding appropriate management strategies for patients with anterior mediastinal masses.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Tissue Studies</bold>
</p>
        <p>Tissue studies are crucial in diagnosing anterior mediastinal masses, providing histopathological confirmation of the underlying pathology, and guiding treatment decisions. Whenever obtaining diagnostic tissue, pathology should confirm that there is adequate tissue for examination. The rapid on-site cytological examination involves rapid tissue evaluation by pathology while the patient is still under procedural sedation so that additional tissue can be obtained if necessary, rather than submitting the patient for an added procedure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r25">[25]</xref>&#x000a0;Several tissue-based investigations may be required or associated with diagnosing these masses:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p><bold>Biopsy:</bold>&#x000a0;Tissue biopsy is often the cornerstone of diagnosis for anterior mediastinal masses. Depending on the suspected etiology, biopsy techniques may include percutaneous needle biopsy, mediastinoscopy, thoracoscopy, or open surgical biopsy. A biopsy allows for histological examination of the mass, providing insights into its cellular composition, architecture, and degree of differentiation while helping differentiate between benign and malignant lesions and guiding subsequent management decisions, including selecting appropriate treatment modalities. However, in cases where the clinical presentation and radiographic features align with characteristic patterns, a tissue biopsy may not always be required to diagnose an anterior mediastinal mass. This scenario is often encountered with thymoma, teratoma, and thyroid goiter. For instance, in an adult 50 or older with MG and typical CT findings indicative of thymoma, a reliable diagnosis can often be established without the need for tissue biopsy. Needle biopsy of thymoma can prove to have adverse effects, such as tumor seeding, which case reports have described.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r26">[26]</xref></p>

          <list-item>
            <p><bold>Histopathological examination:</bold>&#x000a0;Histopathological analysis of biopsy specimens is essential for establishing a definitive diagnosis. Histological features observed on microscopic examination, such as cellular morphology, tissue architecture, mitotic activity, and necrosis, provide valuable information about the nature of the mass.

        <p>The World Health Organization's classification of thymic epithelial tumors also plays a role in staging and determining prognosis. This classification system includes various histological types and grades of thymic tumors, which can further inform treatment decisions and prognosis.</p>
        <p>Accurate staging of thymoma often requires a combination of imaging studies (such as CT scans and MRI) and histopathological evaluation of tissue samples obtained through biopsy or surgical resection. Treatment decisions, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these modalities, are usually tailored based on the stage of the disease and other factors, such as the patient's overall health and preferences.</p>
        <p>Regular follow-up and monitoring are crucial for patients with thymoma, as recurrence can occur even after successful treatment.

        <title>Prognosis</title>
        <p>The prognosis of anterior mediastinal masses varies widely depending on several factors, including the specific histopathological diagnosis, presentation stage, treatment response, and individual patient characteristics. Here is a brief overview of the prognosis for some common anterior mediastinal masses:</p>
        <p>
<bold>Thymoma</bold>
</p>
        <p>The prognosis of thymomas is primarily determined by complete surgical resection (R0 resection), which is the factor most strongly associated with favorable outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;The Masaoka-Koga staging system is commonly used to estimate 5-year survival rates, with encapsulated tumors (stage I) demonstrating the best prognosis, typically achieving 5-year survival rates of 96% to 100%. In contrast, metastatic disease (stages IVA and IVB) is associated with the poorest prognosis, with 5-year survival rates ranging from 11% to 50%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Other factors predictive of poor prognosis include tumor size exceeding 10 cm, patient age younger than 30, evidence of tracheal or vascular compression, epithelial or mixed histology, and the presence of paraneoplastic syndromes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Unlike thymomas, thymic carcinoma and carcinoid tumors are characterized by a much poorer prognosis, and therefore, the Masaoka-Koga staging system is less informative in predicting outcomes for these malignancies. Cytologic features indicative of a worse prognosis include high-grade atypia, necrosis within the tumor, and a high mitotic rate exceeding 10 mitoses per high-power field.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Germ Cell Tumors</bold>
</p>
        <p>Regarding GCTs, teratomas have the best prognosis, as most are benign. Seminomas and NSGCTs have a poorer prognosis and have 5-year survival rates of 86% and 48%, respectively. Persistently elevated tumor markers (alpha-fetoprotein and &#x003b2;-hCG) after chemotherapy are associated with worse outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Lymphoma</bold>
</p>
        <p>Patients classified as stage I or II for HL have a favorable prognosis, with greater than 90% cure rates with standard treatment. Stage IIIA and IIIB have cure rates of 60% to 70%. Stage IV disease carries the worst prognosis, with a cure rate of 50% to 60%. Poor prognostic factors for HL include the following at diagnosis: male sex, age greater than 45, serum albumin less than 4 g/dL, hemoglobin less than 10.5 g/dL, and white blood cell count greater than or equal to 15,000 cells/&#x003bc;L, and lymphocyte count of less than 600 cells/&#x003bc;L.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17651.r31">[31]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Other Masses</bold>
</p>
        <p>Other anterior mediastinal masses, such as substernal goiters or neurogenic tumors, may have variable prognoses depending on tumor size, invasiveness, and histology. Generally, benign masses may have a better prognosis than malignant tumors, particularly if they can be resected entirely without complications.</p>

        <title>Complications</title>
        <p>Anterior mediastinal masses can lead to various complications due to their location and potential effects on adjacent structures. Here are some common complications associated with these masses:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Compression of adjacent structures: One of the most significant complications of anterior mediastinal masses is compression of nearby structures, including the trachea, bronchi, esophagus, and major blood vessels such as the SVC. Compression can lead to symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, stridor, dysphagia, and SVC syndrome, characterized by facial swelling, upper limb edema, and distended neck veins.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Respiratory compromise: Mass effects on the trachea or bronchi can result in airway obstruction, leading to respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening respiratory failure. Severe compression of the airways may require urgent intervention, such as tracheostomy, bronchoscopic stenting, or surgical decompression. Large mediastinal masses can cause pleural effusion or pneumothorax due to compression or invasion of the pleural space. These may lead to respiratory compromise and require drainage for symptomatic relief.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Cardiovascular complications: Compression of the SVC or adjacent cardiac structures can impair venous return and cardiac function, leading to symptoms of SVC syndrome, including facial edema, jugular venous distention, and potentially cardiac tamponade in severe cases. Cardiac compression may also cause arrhythmias or hemodynamic instability. Invasive anterior mediastinal masses may lead to pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade due to direct extension into the pericardial space. Cardiac tamponade presents as dyspnea, hypotension, and jugular venous distention and requires emergent pericardiocentesis for decompression.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Neurological complications: Anterior mediastinal masses can compress or invade neural structures, resulting in neurological deficits such as Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis), brachial plexopathy, or spinal cord compression. These complications may manifest as weakness, sensory changes, or loss of reflexes in the upper limbs.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Malignant transformation and metastasis: Some anterior mediastinal masses, such as thymomas or GCTs, have the potential for malignant transformation or metastasis to distant sites. Metastatic spread may lead to secondary tumors in other organs, further complicating the management and prognosis of the disease.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Endocrine dysfunction: Anterior mediastinal masses originating from the thymus or thyroid gland may disrupt normal endocrine function, leading to hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. These complications may require hormone replacement therapy or other interventions to manage.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>Overall, the complications of anterior mediastinal masses can vary depending on the underlying pathology, tumor size, location, and invasiveness. Prompt recognition and management of these complications are essential to prevent morbidity and improve patient outcomes. A multidisciplinary approach involving thoracic surgeons, oncologists, interventional radiologists, and other specialists is often necessary for comprehensive management.</p>

      <sec id="article-17651.s15" sec-type="Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes ">
        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>Effective management of anterior mediastinal masses requires a collaborative approach involving physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals to ensure patient-centered care, optimize outcomes, enhance patient safety, and improve team performance. Physicians and advanced practitioners use their clinical expertise to diagnose and develop treatment plans tailored to individual patient needs, considering tumor type, stage, and patient preferences. They employ practical communication skills to educate patients about their condition, treatment options, and potential outcomes, fostering shared decision-making and empowering patients to actively participate in their care journey.</p>
        <p>Nurses are vital in providing comprehensive patient care, emotional support, symptom management, and care coordination across settings. They facilitate interprofessional communication by relaying patient updates, coordinating consultations, and ensuring continuity of care throughout the treatment process. Pharmacists contribute by reviewing medication regimens, identifying potential drug interactions, and providing medication counseling to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects. Collaborative team-based care involves regular multidisciplinary meetings where healthcare professionals discuss patient cases, share insights, and collectively develop strategies to enhance care coordination, improve patient outcomes, and ensure patient safety. By leveraging their collective skills, expertise, and collaborative efforts, healthcare teams can provide holistic, patient-centered care that addresses the complex needs of patients with anterior mediastinal masses, ultimately leading to improved clinical outcomes and enhanced overall quality of care.</p>
