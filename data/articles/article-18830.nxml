        <p>Caplan syndrome, or rheumatoid pneumoconiosis, was traditionally associated&#x000a0;primarily with coal dust exposure. However, it is now attributed to inorganic dust exposure from silica and asbestos industries, notably in construction and artificial stone manufacturing. Characterized by multiple peripheral lung nodules in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and pneumoconiosis, diagnosis&#x000a0;of Caplan syndrome necessitates imaging and potential biopsy to exclude malignancy. Individuals with rheumatoid pneumoconiosis are often asymptomatic and experience symptoms only if the nodules grow and coalesce. Progressive massive fibrosis with scarring and architectural distortion of the lung parenchyma may also occur in these individuals. In some cases, the nodules cavitate and become secondarily infected.</p>
        <p>Although&#x000a0;no specific therapy exists, managing symptoms with oxygen and bronchodilators and reducing occupational exposure are key. Despite the frequent delay in presentation and diagnosis following occupational exposure, early recognition by primary care, rheumatology, and pulmonology clinicians can lead to prompt therapy for rheumatoid arthritis, significantly impacting patient outcomes. Occupational health professionals are crucial in educating employees about job-related risks and ensuring timely recognition and removal from hazardous environments.</p>
        <p>This activity reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, and therapeutic management of Caplan syndrome.&#x000a0;In addition, this activity explores evidence-based strategies for symptom management and the role of other therapies in mitigating disease progression,&#x000a0;empowering&#x000a0;healthcare professionals&#x000a0;with the necessary knowledge and tools&#x000a0;to optimize patient outcomes and quality of life for individuals affected by this rare but clinically significant condition.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Caplan syndrome,&#x000a0;or rheumatoid pneumoconiosis, is a combination of multiple well-defined pulmonary nodules predominantly in the lung periphery and inorganic dust exposure in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Classically, affected patients with a history of inorganic dust exposure develop multiple well-defined, predominantly peripheral pulmonary nodules distinct from the typical pattern of coal workers' pneumoconiosis.&#x000a0;Rheumatoid arthritis may be present at diagnosis or develop as late as 10 years after nodule discovery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;In individuals without arthritis, rheumatoid factor is frequently detected but may also be absent. Silicosis or coal workers' pneumoconiosis is commonly observed in patients with Caplan syndrome but is not a prerequisite for this condition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>Histological evaluation is typically&#x000a0;required because the radiographic distinction between the nodules associated with rheumatoid pneumoconiosis and silicosis can be subtle. Rheumatoid pneumoconiosis nodules vary in size from 0.3 to 1.0 cm, making the differentiation of small nodules from typical silicosis challenging. In addition, nodules associated with Caplan syndrome do not follow a typical chronological course. They may grow, remain unchanged, disappear, and, in some cases, reappear. They can also cavitate, calcify, or develop air-fluid levels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Histological testing helps confirm the diagnosis and exclude other serious conditions&#x000a0;such as malignancy. Identifying rheumatoid pneumoconiosis is crucial in occupational health evaluations. Equally vital is grasping the link between rheumatoid arthritis and this condition, as patients may require rheumatoid arthritis&#x02013;targeted treatment following the diagnosis of Caplan syndrome.&#x000a0;</p>

      <sec id="article-18830.s3" sec-type="Etiology">
        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>Previously, Caplan syndrome was primarily associated with occupational exposure to coal dust. However, experts now acknowledge that exposure to any respirable source of silica and asbestos can lead to this condition. Occupations at risk include coal miners, asbestos workers, gold miners, sandblasters, quarrymen, and carbon electrode manufacturing workers. In addition, workers in industries involving rubber dust, aluminum production, and silica-based scouring powder packing are at increased risk. Current industries&#x000a0;such as jewelry polishing, denim jean production, fabrication of artificial stone benchtops, glass manufacturing, and glassware have created a resurgence of silicosis worldwide. There may also be a genetic component, although it remains undefined. Although experts believe smoking exacerbates lung findings, they have not established a direct causal relationship.</p>

        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>Scant epidemiological data exist comparing subjects with and without pulmonary nodules and dust exposure. This lack of data and the rarity of the disease make it challenging to establish the true incidence of Caplan syndrome. The original studies by Caplan reveal that the prevalence of rheumatoid pneumoconiosis among coal workers is 0.4%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;More recent data report a prevalence of&#x000a0;0.89% among coal workers with pneumoconiosis in the United States and 0.74% in Japan.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>In&#x000a0;patients with progressive massive fibrosis, the association between rheumatoid arthritis and silica exposure is more pronounced compared to those with simple pneumoconiosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Many epidemiological studies support the association between occupational exposure to respirable crystalline silica dust and the development of systemic autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;A recent study from China reveals a prevalence of pneumoconiosis with connective tissue diseases at 13.8%, with a prevalence of pneumoconiosis with asbestosis and silicosis of 18.3% and 11.4%, respectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;According to another study, the&#x000a0;prevalence of antinuclear antibody seropositivity in patients with silica-associated pneumoconiosis is approximately 31.9%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r5">[5]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-18830.s5" sec-type="Pathophysiology">
        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>The pathogenesis of rheumatoid pneumoconiosis remains unclear. However, researchers believe that exposure to inorganic dust triggers the immunological phenomena that favor the formation of pulmonary nodules that are histologically similar to the nodules associated with rheumatoid arthritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;A clear link exists between occupational silica inhalation and autoimmune diseases. The proposed theory suggests that silica particles are engulfed by alveolar macrophages, triggering inflammation and activating fibroblasts. The macrophages degrade the silica, which new macrophages subsequently process. Through the pathogen-associated molecular pattern, silica-activated macrophages stimulate the production of various cytokines such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;. This innate immune system activation prompts dendritic cells to present antigens to CD4 T lymphocytes. This cycle of events perpetuates chronic immune activity and fibrosis, leading to the generation of autoantigens. Pneumoconiosis exacerbates the production of autoantibodies, immune complexes, and excessive immunoglobulins, including rheumatoid factor. In addition, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPAs) are frequently observed in Caplan's syndrome, establishing a connection between silica exposure and ACPA-positive rheumatoid arthritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;The range of frequencies observed after silica exposure implies substantial genetic participation and interaction with environmental factors in silica-induced autoimmunity.</p>
        <p>Pulmonary nodules develop due to the stimulation of the bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue in the&#x000a0;lungs. Silica, smoking, and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis all stimulate bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue. With chronic stimulation, bronchus-associated lymphoid tissues&#x000a0;in the&#x000a0;lungs&#x000a0;mature with the formation of germinal centers. Although malignant transformation is possible, there is no evidence of silica-associated malignant lymphoma in the clinical literature.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r7">[7]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-18830.s6" sec-type="Histopathology">
        <title>Histopathology</title>
        <p>The histological characteristics allow clinicians to differentiate between rheumatoid arthritis nodules, Caplan nodules, and silicosis. Pulmonary nodules in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are round, well-defined opacities of variable size predominantly located in the upper lobes in a subpleural position. Histologically, a central area of brightly eosinophilic necrosis is surrounded by a zone of dark basophilic necrosis, followed by a layer of histiocytes in a palisade arrangement. The outermost layer contains granulation tissue and chronic inflammation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>A necrobiotic rheumatoid nodule that contains dust is a characteristic description of a Caplan nodule. The central necrotic area of Caplan nodules is surrounded by alternating layers of black coal dust and necrotic tissue. A zone of inflammatory cells containing polymorphonuclear granulocytes, macrophages, and giant cells surrounds the dust rings. In some cases, dust may be noted within the macrophages as well. This active zone of inflammation differentiates active Caplan nodules from silicotic nodules.&#x000a0;The inflammatory zone is characterized by palisading cells, typically in lesser numbers compared to the typical nodules associated with rheumatoid arthritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;In the absence of an active inflammatory zone, concentric rings of coal dust can help identify Caplan nodules from silicotic nodules.</p>
        <p>Two different histopathological presentations characterize Caplan syndrome. The classic form consists of large nodules that show uniform necrosis with a background of mild pneumoconiosis. The silicotic type consists of smaller nodules with necrotic areas that retain some characteristics of a silicotic nodule. Patients with this form of Caplan syndrome present with frank silicosis with or without massive fibrosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r2">[2]</xref></p>

<bold>Patient History</bold>
</p>
        <p>Rheumatoid nodules and Caplan nodules are asymptomatic in most cases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;<bold>Clinicians identify many individuals after identifying an incidental lung nodule on radiographic imaging for other reasons.</bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Rheumatoid and Caplan nodules can undergo cavitation and rupture, leading to complications&#x000a0;such as pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pyopneumothorax, bronchopleural fistula, hemoptysis, and infection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>Caplan syndrome is characterized by the rapid development of multiple peripheral basilar nodules associated with mild airflow obstruction. Despite the presence of multiple pulmonary nodules, most patients with the classic form do not report symptoms. According to&#x000a0;a case report, pulmonary function testing at diagnosis reveals a mild obstructive pattern with decreased <bold>forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)</bold> to <bold>forced vital capacity (FVC)</bold> ratio without recognizable pulmonary symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>Patients with the silicotic form are typically symptomatic. Affected patients may report pleuritic chest pain, a dry cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue. The symptoms are likely related to accelerated silicosis. Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis are pain, morning stiffness, and swelling in numerous joints. The metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints of the fingers, interphalangeal joints of the thumbs, wrists, and metatarsophalangeal joints of the toes are commonly affected. Other synovial joints in the upper and lower extremities, including the elbows, shoulders, ankles, and knees, are commonly involved.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Physical Examination</bold>
</p>
        <p>Respiratory findings may be normal or include wheezing and crackles on lung examination. Typically, joint findings are symmetric, and clinicians observe swelling and pain&#x000a0;upon palpation or&#x000a0;during active and passive movement of the affected joint. Peripheral joints are affected in nearly every patient with rheumatoid arthritis. The hands are frequently the first area to be affected, and a reduced grip strength is often an early marker of disease. Some patients present with carpal tunnel. Joint deformities&#x000a0;such as metacarpophalangeal subluxation, ulnar deviation or ulnar drift, swan neck, and boutonniere deformities of the fingers typically develop later in the disease process. Cervical spine involvement marked by pain and stiffness in the neck is also common.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-18830.s8" sec-type="Evaluation">
        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>Patients with pulmonary nodules should undergo a comprehensive assessment, including a detailed history and a thorough physical examination. Clinicians should pay particular attention to obtaining details about their occupational history, smoking habits, and family history.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r7">[7]</xref> In addition, inquiring about systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, joint pain and stiffness, dyspnea, and cough is crucial to the evaluation.</p>
        <p>Clinicians must differentiate Caplan and rheumatoid nodules from malignant nodules.&#x000a0;Advanced patient age and underlying risk factors help predict the malignant potential of a pulmonary nodule. Clinicians must remember that younger age without risk factors does not exclude the diagnosis of malignancy. Experts generally assign some risk of malignancy to pulmonary nodules in patients 35 and older. The following is a risk stratification of malignancy based on age.</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>35 to 39 years: 3%</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>40 to 49 years: 15%</p>

          <list-item>
            <p>50 to 59 years: 43%</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>60 years and older:&#x000a0;Greater than 50%</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>Risk factors are&#x000a0;smoking, family history, female sex, emphysema, prior malignancy, and exposure to asbestos.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Radiographic Imaging</bold>
</p>
        <p>Clinicians should attempt to obtain all prior imaging studies for comparative analysis. Although the syndrome was initially diagnosed based on radiographic imaging, it can be challenging to differentiate Caplan from rheumatoid nodules and malignancy based on radiography alone. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest without intravenous contrast is the imaging modality of choice. Findings that suggest the presence of rheumatoid nodules over malignancy include the presence of&#x000a0;satellite nodules, a smooth border,&#x000a0;peripheral location, and pleural&#x000a0;contact. Cavitation and calcification also favor rheumatoid nodules over malignancy. Nodule size is an independent predictor of malignancy. <bold>The risk of malignancy increases with size:</bold></p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Nodules less than 5 mm:&#x000a0;Less than 1%</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Nodules 5 to 9 mm: 2% to 6%&#x000a0;</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Nodules 8 to 20 mm: 18%</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Nodules larger than 20 mm:&#x000a0;More than 50%</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>Subsolid nodules are more likely to be malignant compared to&#x000a0;solid nodules, and nodules that have remained stable are less likely to be malignant.&#x000a0;In ambiguous cases, 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18-FDG PET) imaging may be performed as rheumatoid arthritis nodules are less FDG-avid compared to most&#x000a0;malignancies. In this setting, FDG-avid lymph nodes&#x000a0;are absent as well.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;18-FDG PET scanning is most helpful in distinguishing solid nodules larger than 8 mm. PET imaging is unreliable with subsolid nodules, and false positive and false negative results can occur.</p>
        <p>Caplan nodules exhibit features similar to rheumatoid nodules on radiographic imaging. On CT, they vary in size from 0.5 to 5 cm and typically diffuse in the craniocaudal plane, with a higher prevalence in the middle to the outer one-third of the lungs in the axial plane. In most individuals, Caplan nodules&#x000a0;evolve rapidly within a few weeks to months. They then appear to stabilize and persist without change over many years. In some cases, they heal with remnant asteroid scarring, or they may also cavitate and calcify.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Cavitation and calcification are quite common. Larger nodules, especially those that grow, can coalesce to form nodular consolidations&#x000a0;of progressive massive fibrosis. With progressive massive fibrosis, scarring and architectural distortion are noted.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Serum Markers</bold>
</p>
        <p>Seropositivity for <bold>antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies</bold> is common in patients with Caplan syndrome. Seropositivity for rheumatoid factor is approximately 70%. In patients with a radiographic appearance of Caplan syndrome with no clinical evidence of rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid factor positivity drops to nearly 50%. Of note, approximately 25% of patients with silicosis&#x000a0;are positive for rheumatoid factor, irrespective of rheumatoid arthritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;The high antinuclear antibody titer&#x000a0;typically reveals a homogeneous pattern in these patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;ACPA may be positive in some cases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r10">[10]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Pulmonary Function Testing</bold>
</p>
        <p>Pulmonary function tests often reveal a mild obstructive pattern in patients with Caplan syndrome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;However, there are documented cases of individuals exhibiting a mixed restrictive and obstructive pattern, particularly among those with progressive massive fibrosis. In patients with progressive massive fibrosis, pulmonary function testing typically reveals reduced vital capacity and significant airflow obstruction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;According to a&#x000a0;study, however, adjusting for age, smoking, and mining exposure results in similar lung volumes and diffusion capacities in patients with classic Caplan syndrome and progressive massive fibrosis.

        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>Therapeutic management&#x000a0;of Caplan syndrome mainly involves supportive care. Patients should receive vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcal infections. Clinicians should administer oxygen and bronchodilators if necessary. Although most Caplan nodules remain stable without specific treatment, some may develop complications such as cavitation, superimposed infections, or bronchopleural fistulas. Although corticosteroids have been used in some cases to slow the progression of rapidly growing nodules, evidence supporting this approach is limited. Overall, therapy aims to minimize occupational exposure, promote the cessation of&#x000a0;cigarette smoking, and adhere to evidence-based guidelines for managing rheumatoid arthritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>No currently available therapy has demonstrated efficacy in patients with severe symptomatic disease. A recent case using rituximab, methotrexate, and prednisolone to alleviate symptoms in a patient with symptomatic Caplan syndrome reveals a notable improvement in rheumatoid arthritis&#x02013;associated joint pain, but pulmonary symptoms remained unaffected. Another recent case report suggests that treatment with rituximab, initiated for rheumatoid arthritis symptoms, contributed to stabilizing Caplan nodules. However, it did not appear to alter the evolution of these nodules. Further study is needed to establish a treatment consensus for Caplan syndrome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r14">[14]</xref></p>
        <p>Animal studies reveal that organic dust exposure in specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) phenotypes increases proinflammatory responses, resulting in elevated cytokine and chemokine levels. This enhanced lung inflammation in HLA-DR4+ mice produces pathologic features consistent with rheumatoid arthritis&#x02013;associated lung disease, including Caplan syndrome. In these animal models, researchers reported enhanced production of citrulline and malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde (MAA)&#x02013;modified lung proteins, and serum and bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue<bold>&#x000a0;</bold>anti-MAA antibodies. Further study is necessary to determine if specific cytokine-targeted therapies may benefit the pulmonary findings of Caplan syndrome in these individuals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r15">[15]</xref></p>
        <p>No evidence-based guidelines exist regarding the long-term management of Caplan nodules. An individualized follow-up plan is required based on the Caplan syndrome type and the radiographic severity of these nodules. Patients with the silicotic form warrant close follow-up as they likely have significant airflow abnormalities. Patients with larger and greater numbers of nodules warrant close follow-up to monitor for complications such as hemoptysis or pneumothorax.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r7">[7]</xref></p>

        <title>Prognosis</title>
        <p>Based on case reports and older studies in patients with Caplan syndrome, the prognosis depends on the extent of antigen exposure, exacerbating factors such as cigarette smoking, and the severity of lung damage. Severe respiratory disability is a rare finding in patients with Caplan syndrome, but some patients can progress to develop progressive massive fibrosis. Most current literature is unable to differentiate morbidity and mortality associated with Caplan syndrome from that of concomitant cigarette smoking and underlying rheumatoid arthritis. The former is particularly difficult due to the lag time between occupational exposure to Caplan syndrome&#x02013;associated antigens and an official diagnosis of Caplan syndrome.</p>
        <p>A recent study from Korea attempts to differentiate between patients with underlying rheumatoid arthritis and those with underlying rheumatoid arthritis and prior silica exposure. The study calculates the standardized hospital admission ratio by dividing the observed hospital admissions in silica-exposed workers by the reference population. They report that the standardized hospital admission ratio was higher in the silica-exposed group. They also noted that silica-exposed workers without a diagnosis of pneumoconiosis had a higher standardized hospital admission ratio&#x000a0;compared to&#x000a0;the general population, suggesting that the severity of rheumatoid arthritis is increased with silica exposure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r17">[17]</xref></p>

        <p>Complications associated with Caplan syndrome are exceedingly rare.

        <p>Many of these complications are commonly associated with rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, the lag time between exposure and diagnosis makes it particularly difficult to establish a causal link. Without robust data, researchers find assigning these complications to Caplan syndrome difficult.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Clinical studies consistently identify an increased risk of developing lung cancer, particularly non&#x02013;small cell lung cancer, with silica exposure. However, most studies have been unable to exclude other factors, such as cigarette smoking.

        <p>Occupational exposure to dust and silica must be kept to a minimum to prevent rheumatoid pneumoconiosis.

        <p>Patients should understand their right to protection, as outlined by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). OSHA sets permissible exposure limits for respirable crystalline silica, requiring additional safety measures for exposure exceeding 25 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> over an 8-hour day. If an employer cannot limit exposure at or below the permissible exposure limits, respirators are necessary for all at-risk workers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18830.r23">[23]</xref>&#x000a0;OSHA mandates health assessments and surveillance for employees exposed above these limits.

Patients&#x000a0;must understand the symptoms of pneumoconiosis and joint symptoms associated with rheumatoid arthritis and seek medical attention if they develop any symptoms.</p>
        <p>OSHA also requires health examinations for exposure assessment and medical surveillance for workers at risk for respirable silica exposure. The final rule requires medical surveillance for workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica at or above 25 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3&#x000a0;</sup>of air averaged over an 8-hour work day for 30 or more days per year.

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>Caplan syndrome, historically associated with coal dust exposure, is now recognized to occur due to inorganic dust exposure from various industries containing silica and asbestos. Currently, the construction and artificial stone industries are significant contributors to cases of silicosis worldwide. Caplan syndrome manifests as multiple pulmonary nodules that rapidly occur predominantly in the lung periphery in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and pneumoconiosis. Diagnosis requires imaging and possibly biopsy to differentiate the lung nodule from malignancy. Clinicians must recognize the association with rheumatoid arthritis. Although no specific therapy exists, current management involves symptom control with oxygen and bronchodilators as needed, along with avoiding further occupational exposure and cessation of cigarette smoking if applicable.</p>
        <p>Given the overlap between pulmonary, rheumatological, and possible malignant findings and concerns, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary to recognize the varied clinical presentations and understand the nuances of diagnostic techniques. Understanding the close relationship between occupational silica exposure, rheumatoid arthritis, and Caplan syndrome, primary care, rheumatology, and pulmonology clinicians can help identify rheumatoid arthritis early in individuals who develop conspicuous pulmonary nodules. Providing early guideline-directed therapy for rheumatoid arthritis in these individuals has a tremendous impact on rheumatoid arthritis&#x02013;associated clinical outcomes for affected patients.</p>
        <p>Occupational healthcare professionals play an essential role in preventing this disease by ensuring that patients understand the risks associated with their occupation. Thoroughly educating employees about the potential consequences and prevention of unsafe exposure levels can significantly improve clinical outcomes for at-risk patients. In addition, occupational health clinicians must follow diligent surveillance protocols to ensure early recognition of at-risk or affected individuals and coordinate their removal from the hazardous environment. Each healthcare team member must be aware of their responsibilities and communicate their unique expertise seamlessly to allow for collaborative decision-making among the team members. By embracing these principles of skill, responsibilities, interprofessional communication, and patient education, healthcare professionals can deliver patient-centered care, ultimately improving overall patient outcomes.</p>
