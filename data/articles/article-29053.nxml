        <p>Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm (SOVA) is a rare cardiac condition characterized by an abnormal dilation in the wall of the aortic sinus, typically occurring above the aortic valve. This condition can be either congenital or acquired, with congenital cases often associated with other cardiac anomalies such as ventricular septal defects or a bicuspid aortic valve. SOVA generally remains asymptomatic until it ruptures, at which point it can lead to severe complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or sudden death. Management strategies include careful monitoring for asymptomatic cases and prompt surgical intervention for symptomatic or ruptured aneurysms to prevent severe outcomes and improve patient prognosis.</p>
        <p>Clinicians participating in this educational activity gain valuable insights and skills for managing SOVA, including understanding its pathophysiology, diagnostic strategies, and treatment options for ruptured and unruptured cases. The course covers advanced imaging techniques, surgical approaches, and transcatheter interventions, equipping participants to make informed decisions in clinical practice. Additionally, clinicians learn effective strategies for interprofessional collaboration, which enhances patient-centered care and optimizes outcomes.&#x000a0;</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>A sinus of Valsalva aneurysm (SOVA) is a rare cardiac condition that includes an&#x000a0;abnormal dilatation of the aortic root between the aortic valve annulus and the sinotubular junction caused by weakness in the elastic lamina at the junction of the aortic media and the annulus fibrosis. Usually, the sinuses&#x000a0;prevent the coronary artery ostia occlusion during systole when the aortic valve opens. The normal sinus diameter is less than 4 cm for men and 3.6 cm for women (see&#x000a0;<bold>Image.&#x000a0;</bold>Sinus of Valsalva Aneurysm).</p>
        <p>While SOVAs are usually isolated, rare cases involve aneurysms in&#x000a0;2 or&#x000a0;3 sinuses. A SOVA most commonly occurs in the right coronary sinus (70%) and typically remains asymptomatic until it ruptures into nearby structures. The aneurysmal sinus can rupture into an adjacent heart chamber, and the specific location of the rupture depends on the SOVA's position: the right, left, and noncoronary sinuses are adjacent to the interventricular septum, left ventricular free wall, and interatrial septum, respectively. These anatomical proximities help explain the rupture's origin based on the SOVA's location.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29053.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;This rupture creates a communication between the aorta and the heart chamber, leading to progressive heart failure. Without treatment, patients with a ruptured&#x000a0;SOVA&#x000a0;face poor prognoses and high mortality rates, making&#x000a0;timely intervention essential. Any diagnosis of SOVA should prompt an urgent referral to a cardiothoracic surgeon for consideration of repair.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29053.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29053.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29053.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29053.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;SOVAs occur in approximately 0.2% to 0.9% of patients who had cardiac surgery. SOVA can be either congenital or acquired; congenital SOVA, most commonly seen in men of Asian descent, results from abnormal development of the bulbus cordis and often coexists with anomalies like ventricular septal defect (VSD), aortic insufficiency, and bicuspid aortic valve. Acquired SOVA can be linked to prior surgeries, atherosclerosis, endocarditis, syphilis, and other forms of trauma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29053.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>

        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>As previously mentioned, SOVAs can be either congenital or acquired.&#x000a0;Congenital SOVAs result from abnormal development of the bulbus cordis during embryogenesis, leading to structural weaknesses in the aortic wall. This type of SOVA is often linked to various other cardiac anomalies, with a VSD being present in 30% to 60% of cases. Other common associations include aortic valve regurgitation (20%), bicuspid aortic valve (10%), pulmonic stenosis, coarctation of the aorta, atrial septal defect (ASD), and occasionally, coronary artery anomalies. Additionally, subvalvular aneurysms affecting the aortic and mitral annuli are known associations.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Acquired SOVAs, on the other hand, develop due to factors that weaken the aortic wall over time, including&#x000a0;connective tissue issues and infectious diseases. Embryologically, the sinus of Valsalva forms as a blind diverticulum due to pressure forces on the aortic root. Aneurysmal dilation of the sinus of Valsalva can occur due to connective tissue weaknesses from disorders such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and is historically associated with the presence of a bicuspid aortic valve.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29053.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29053.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29053.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29053.r9">[9]</xref> Other connective tissue causes include chronic atherosclerotic changes leading to cystic medial necrosis, chest trauma, and iatrogenic injury during aortic valve replacement surgery. Additionally, vasculitides involving the proximal aorta, such as Takayasu arteritis and inflammatory aortitis, can contribute to the formation of SOVA. Infectious causes that weaken elastic tissue and lead to acquired SOVA include syphilis, tuberculosis, and infective endocarditis.&#x000a0;</p>

      <sec id="article-29053.s4" sec-type="Epidemiology">
        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>SOVAs are rare, occurring in approximately 0.2% to 0.9% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The incidence is even lower in the general population, with many cases remaining undetected until a significant event, such as a rupture, occurs. SOVAs comprise&#x000a0;up to 3.5% of all congenital&#x000a0;heart defects. Congenital SOVAs are 4 times more common in men and particularly prevalent among Asian populations, suggesting a genetic predisposition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29053.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29053.r10">[10]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29053.r11">[11]</xref> They are typically identified in younger individuals due to their congenital nature. Acquired SOVAs tend to present in older adults, reflecting the cumulative effects of risk factors like atherosclerosis and past infections. About 70% of SOVAs occur in the right coronary sinus. The condition is often asymptomatic until rupture, which can lead to severe complications and high mortality rates without prompt treatment.</p>

      <sec id="article-29053.s5" sec-type="Pathophysiology">
        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>The pathophysiology of SOVA involves a complex interplay of anatomical and physiological factors that lead to the formation and potential rupture of the aneurysm. SOVAs occur at the sinuses of Valsalva, the&#x000a0;3 dilated portions of the aortic root situated between the aortic valve annulus and the sinotubular junction. These sinuses are normally reinforced by the elastic lamina, a structural layer providing integrity and resilience to the aortic wall. SOVAs form when there is a weakness or defect in this lamina, particularly at the junction of the aortic media and the annulus fibrosis. In congenital cases, the abnormal development of the bulbus cordis during embryogenesis results in a structurally weak aortic wall, predisposing the sinuses to aneurysmal dilatation. This congenital defect is often associated with other congenital heart anomalies, such as VSD, aortic insufficiency, and bicuspid aortic valve.</p>
        <p>Acquired SOVAs result from degenerative changes in the aortic wall due to aging, atherosclerosis, or connective tissue disorders, leading to gradual weakening and susceptibility to aneurysm formation. Infectious and inflammatory processes, such as endocarditis and syphilis, can cause inflammatory damage to the aortic wall, further contributing to SOVA development. Trauma and complications from cardiac surgeries can also precipitate SOVA by physically damaging the aortic wall. The aortic root is subject to significant hemodynamic stress due to the high-pressure blood flow from the left ventricle. This stress is particularly pronounced at the sinuses of Valsalva, where the aortic valve cusps attach. In the presence of a structural defect or weakness, this stress can exacerbate the dilatation of the aortic wall, leading to aneurysm formation.</p>
        <p>The most critical complication of SOVA is rupture. As the aneurysm enlarges, the thin wall can eventually give way, causing blood to spill into adjacent cardiac chambers or the pericardial space, creating a pathological communication between the aorta and the heart chambers and leading to hemodynamic instability and heart failure.&#x000a0;The consequences of rupture typically depend on the anatomical location of the aneurysm.&#x000a0;Rupture&#x000a0;of the right and noncoronary sinuses typically results in communication between the aorta and either the right atrium or the right ventricular outflow tract, thus creating a left-to-right shunt, which can lead to right ventricular overload and right-sided heart failure.&#x000a0;A&#x000a0;left&#x000a0;SOVA&#x000a0;rupture is clinically less significant, causing&#x000a0;communication to the left atrium or left ventricular outflow tract.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29053.r12">[12]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29053.r13">[13]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29053.r14">[14]</xref> Chronic aortic regurgitation can develop if the aneurysm distorts the aortic valve, leading to volume overload and subsequent heart failure. Thus, the pathophysiology of SOVA involves congenital structural weaknesses, degenerative changes, and hemodynamic stress, making understanding and managing this condition critical for patient outcomes.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-29053.s6" sec-type="Histopathology">
        <title>Histopathology</title>
        <p>The histopathology of SOVA reveals distinct structural changes in the aortic wall that contribute to the development and progression of the aneurysm. Key features include degeneration of the elastic lamina, where elastic fibers show significant fragmentation and loss, leading to weakened aortic walls predisposed to aneurysmal dilatation. Medial degeneration, characterized by cystic medial necrosis with loss of smooth muscle cells and the presence of mucoid extracellular matrix material, is often evident. Inflammatory changes are also common, with infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages indicating ongoing inflammation, which can further weaken the aorta. Atherosclerotic changes, such as lipid-laden macrophages, intimal thickening, and calcification, are observed in acquired SOVAs.</p>
        <p>Chronic inflammatory processes can lead to fibrosis and scarring within the aortic wall, with fibrous tissue replacing normal elastic fibers, reducing the aorta's elasticity and resilience. The intimal layer may become thickened and fibrotic in response to chronic stress and injury. In congenital SOVA, structural abnormalities in the vascular architecture reflect the underlying developmental defect, including irregular arrangement of smooth muscle cells and elastic fibers, often associated with other congenital anomalies like&#x000a0;VSD or bicuspid aortic valve. Thrombus formation is another histopathological feature, especially where blood stasis within the dilated sinus occurs, with thrombi potentially organizing into the wall. Damage to the endothelial lining, often due to turbulent blood flow within the aneurysm, can lead to thrombus formation and embolization risk.</p>

        <p><bold>Medical Management</bold>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Medical management of SOVA is primarily a temporary measure to stabilize patients until definitive surgical or transcatheter intervention can be performed, as it is insufficient for definitive treatment.&#x000a0;For unruptured SOVA, medical management involves regular monitoring with echocardiography or other imaging modalities to track aneurysm size and progression. Blood pressure control is essential, typically achieved with antihypertensive medications such as beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or calcium channel blockers to reduce stress on the aortic wall. Patients are also advised to modify their activities, avoiding strenuous physical exertion and heavy lifting to prevent increases in intrathoracic pressure that could precipitate rupture. &#x000a0;In cases of ruptured SOVA, immediate medical stabilization is critical, involving fluid resuscitation, blood pressure control, and managing heart failure or shock symptoms until surgical treatment can be performed.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Surgical Repair</bold>
</p>
        <p>Surgical repair of SOVA is a critical intervention, particularly for symptomatic, large, or rapidly enlarging unruptured aneurysms and all ruptured aneurysms. The primary goal is to prevent rupture and restore normal aortic and cardiac function. An unruptured&#x000a0;SOVA should be surgically repaired if it is associated with significant symptoms or rapidly enlarges. The 2010 American Guidelines for Thoracic Aortic Disease recommend considering surgical repair in those with aneurysms greater than 5.5 cm, greater than 5 cm in those with bicuspid valves, and greater than 4.5 cm in the setting of connective tissue disease.&#x000a0;SOVA repair should be considered when a yearly growth rate exceeds&#x000a0;0.5 cm. Surgical repair involves cardiopulmonary bypass, cardioplegia, and primary or patch closure.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The surgical procedure typically involves a median sternotomy, providing direct access to the heart. Various surgical techniques are employed depending on the aneurysm's size, location, and involvement of the aortic valve. Aortic root replacement, where the aneurysmal portion of the aortic root is replaced with a synthetic graft, is a common approach. This may include valve-sparing techniques or valve replacement if the aortic valve is affected. Alternatively, patch repair, which involves reinforcing the aneurysm with a patch to preserve native aortic tissue, may be performed for less extensive aneurysms.</p>
        <p>In cases of ruptured SOVA, urgent cardiothoracic surgical evaluation and immediate surgical repair are essential due to the high risk of mortality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29053.r16">[16]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29053.r17">[17]</xref> This emergency procedure often involves similar techniques but under more urgent conditions, requiring rapid stabilization of the patient. Any associated cardiac issues, such as VSDs or aortic valve dysfunction, are also addressed during surgery. Postoperative care in an intensive care unit is crucial for monitoring and managing complications like bleeding, infection, or heart failure. Long-term follow-up with imaging studies is necessary to ensure the integrity of the repair and monitor for potential recurrence or other complications. Surgical repair of SOVA, while invasive, remains a definitive treatment with a high success rate, significantly improving patient outcomes when performed promptly and effectively.&#x000a0;Surgical mortality ranges from 1.9% to 3.6%, while survival rates are close to 90% after&#x000a0;15 years.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Transcatheter Closure</bold>
</p>
        <p>Transcatheter closure of SOVA is an emerging, minimally invasive technique used to treat ruptured and unruptured aneurysms. Over the past 2 decades, enhanced transcatheter techniques have expanded the range of nonsurgical repair options. This approach offers a viable alternative to traditional open-heart surgery, especially for high-risk surgical candidates due to age, comorbidities, or other factors. Indications for the procedure include emergency intervention for ruptured SOVA causing hemodynamic instability or heart failure and elective treatment for symptomatic, enlarging, or high-risk unruptured aneurysms.</p>
        <p>The procedure involves a thorough pre-procedural assessment, including imaging studies like echocardiography, computed tomography angiography, or magnetic resonance imaging to delineate the aneurysm's anatomy. Vascular access is typically obtained through the femoral artery or vein, and the procedure is performed under fluoroscopic and echocardiographic guidance. A catheter is navigated to the aneurysm site, and a closure device, such as an Amplatzer occluder or vascular plug, is deployed to seal the aneurysm, eliminating the abnormal communication between the aorta and adjacent cardiac chambers. Post-deployment imaging confirms the proper placement and function of the device.</p>
        <p>Transcatheter closure offers several advantages, including avoiding open-heart surgery, reducing surgical risks, and shortening recovery time and hospital stay. Patients typically experience faster recovery and can resume normal activities within a few days to weeks. Studies have demonstrated high success rates for transcatheter closure, with effective aneurysm occlusion and relief of symptoms. Potential complications, such as device malposition, residual shunt, or embolization, are generally low and manageable with prompt intervention. Regular follow-up with imaging is necessary to monitor the closure's integrity and detect any device-related complications early. With advancements in device technology and procedural techniques, transcatheter closure is increasingly preferred in managing SOVA, offering significant benefits over traditional surgical approaches.</p>
        <p>A recent study of&#x000a0;the transcatheter closure selection criteria was documented in 256 cases of SOVA. The most common criterion, reported in 77% of the cases, was the absence of other cardiac anomalies besides a ruptured SOVA that would necessitate surgery. All the patients studied underwent transcatheter closure of ruptured SOVA, achieving a total success rate of 95.6%, with various&#x000a0;device types employed. Patent ductus arteriosus occluders were the most frequently used devices in 172 cases (41.7%), followed by the Amplatzer ductal occluder in 85 cases (20.6%). The device's size was determined based on the defect size assessed by transesophageal echocardiography or other imaging techniques.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29053.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29053.r18">[18]</xref>&#x000a0;Ultimately, randomized trial data will be necessary to optimize the management of these rare conditions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29053.r19">[19]</xref></p>

        <title>Prognosis</title>
        <p>The prognosis of SOVA is generally favorable, particularly when surgical intervention is performed for unruptured aneurysms. Results from a recent study demonstrated that most surgeries for unruptured SOVAs were uneventful, achieving a 96% success rate, with 51 out of 53 cases being successfully managed. However, in-hospital mortality occurred in 4% of cases, with&#x000a0;2 patients succumbing:&#x000a0;1 during the operation and another within 48 hours after the operation due to multiorgan failure. The length of hospital stay following surgical management ranged from 4 to 21 days, reflecting varying recovery periods.</p>
        <p>Follow-up data for 31 patients, spanning from&#x000a0;5 days to&#x000a0;9 years, indicated that most patients were asymptomatic and exhibited complete aneurysm obliteration, full restoration of aortic root anatomy, and normal valvular function in 94% of cases (29 out of 31). Despite the generally positive outcomes, complications did arise in a minority of patients. One patient required percutaneous intervention during follow-up due to a detected leak, with only partial thrombosis of the aneurysm after surgical repair. At a 2-month follow-up after this intervention, a computed tomography angiogram showed almost complete thrombosis of the aneurysm lumen. Additionally,&#x000a0;1 patient experienced a recurrence of SVA at&#x000a0;9 years post-surgery, necessitating further surgical intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29053.r20">[20]</xref> Overall, the prognosis for patients with SOVA, particularly those undergoing surgery for unruptured aneurysms, is optimistic, with most patients achieving long-term stability and normal function.</p>
        <p>The prognosis of ruptured SOVA is generally poor without prompt surgical intervention. The rupture of a SOVA leads to the sudden onset of severe symptoms, including acute chest pain, dyspnea, and hemodynamic instability. The rupture creates an abnormal communication between the aorta and adjacent cardiac chambers, often resulting in significant blood loss, rapid development of heart failure, and potential multiorgan failure due to compromised perfusion. Without immediate surgical repair, the mortality rate is high. The acute nature of the condition necessitates urgent medical attention, as delays in treatment can lead to fatal outcomes. Even with surgical intervention, the complexity of the condition means there are inherent risks, and the patient's overall health and the presence of comorbidities can significantly influence outcomes.</p>
        <p>Study data indicate that surgical repair of a ruptured SOVA can stabilize the patient's condition and improve long-term outcomes, but the immediate postoperative period remains critical. The success of surgery depends on various factors, including the size and location of the rupture, the patient's hemodynamic status at presentation, and the presence of any concurrent cardiac conditions. Following surgical repair, patients typically require close monitoring in an intensive care setting to manage potential complications such as bleeding, infection, and residual or recurrent aneurysms. Long-term follow-up is essential to monitor for recurrence, assess heart function, and ensure the integrity of the repair. Despite the risks, successful surgical intervention can significantly improve the prognosis for patients with ruptured SOVA, enabling many to achieve stable, long-term health.</p>

        <title>Deterrence and Patient Education</title>
        <p>Deterrence and patient education are crucial in managing SOVA to prevent complications and ensure optimal outcomes. Regular monitoring, including routine echocardiograms and follow-up appointments with a cardiologist, is essential for assessing the aneurysm's size and progression. Controlling risk factors, such as strict blood pressure management and infection prevention with prophylactic antibiotics, is vital. Patients should avoid strenuous activities, such as contact sports and heavy lifting, that increase intrathoracic pressure and risk rupture. Genetic counseling is recommended for those with a congenital SOVA, especially if there is a family history of connective tissue disorders or aortic aneurysms.</p>
        <p>Patient education involves helping patients understand the nature of SOVA, including its causes, symptoms, and potential complications. Emphasizing the importance of early detection and management and teaching patients to recognize symptoms indicating aneurysm progression or rupture is key. Ensuring medication adherence, particularly for antihypertensives, and promoting a heart-healthy diet, smoking cessation, and stress management techniques support overall cardiovascular health. Developing an emergency plan outlining steps to take if acute symptoms occur is also critical.</p>
        <p>For patients who have undergone surgical repair, clear instructions on postoperative care, signs of complications, and the importance of follow-up appointments are necessary. Discussing any activity restrictions during recovery and gradually reintroducing activities as their clinician recommends helps ensure a smooth recovery. Encouraging participation in patient support groups and involving family members in educational sessions can create a supportive home environment and help patients adhere to management plans. Effective deterrence and patient education enable proactive management of SOVA, helping to prevent complications and improve patient outcomes and quality of life.</p>

        <p>SOVAs may remain asymptomatic until they rupture acutely, most frequently into the right atrium or right ventricle, although simultaneous rupture into both chambers is rare. Physical examination plays a crucial role in assessing these patients; the emergence of a new continuous murmur is always a significant finding and should prompt immediate echocardiography for timely diagnosis and intervention. Transthoracic echocardiogram and transesophageal echocardiogram&#x000a0;are highly effective imaging techniques for investigating SOVAs and related cardiac abnormalities. Further, the ruptured&#x000a0;SOVA is a surgical urgency with a high rate of mortality if left untreated; surgical repair remains the preferred treatment method, although transcatheter closure devices are acceptable for patients with suitable anatomy and high risk for cardiac surgery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29053.r21">[21]</xref></p>
