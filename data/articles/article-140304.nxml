        <p>Iodine-131 (I-131) is a radiopharmaceutical used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, including postoperative treatment of thyroid malignancies and hyperthyroidism. Radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy primarily uses I-131 to exploit the thyroid gland's affinity for iodine, delivering targeted radiation to destroy overactive thyroid tissue or residual cancer cells. RAI therapy is a highly effective postoperative modality for well-differentiated thyroid cancer, serving as either adjuvant therapy or treatment for known residual malignancies or metastases, as well as for the ablation of residual benign thyroid tissue. However, the therapy can cause short-term adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, neck tenderness, swelling, and sialadenitis, leading to dry mouth and altered taste.&#x000a0;Long-term complications may include hypothyroidism, radiation-induced thyroiditis, secondary malignancies (although rare), and reproductive effects such as temporary infertility in men and menstrual irregularities in women. Other concerns include the exacerbation of thyroid eye disease in patients with Graves disease and potential radiation exposure to others, necessitating strict safety protocols.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Despite the risks, RAI therapy remains a cornerstone in managing well-differentiated thyroid cancers and other specific thyroid disorders. In addition, it significantly improves patient prognosis when appropriately applied, underscoring the need for careful patient selection, thorough pretreatment evaluation, and vigilant posttreatment monitoring.&#x000a0;This activity reviews indications for RAI therapy, covering thyroid gland anatomy and physiology, thyroid malignancies, indications and contraindications, patient preparation, and potential treatment complications.&#x000a0;This activity provides guidance to healthcare professionals on collaborating within the team to identify patients requiring RAI therapy and administer the treatment effectively, thereby improving patient outcomes.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine cancer and is histologically classified into papillary thyroid, follicular thyroid, Hurthle cell, medullary thyroid, and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-140304.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Differentiated thyroid&#x000a0;Among these, differentiated thyroid cancers&#x02014;papillary thyroid, follicular thyroid, and Hurthle cell carcinoma&#x02014;are the most common.&#x000a0;Of these, papillary thyroid cancer accounts for 80% to 90% and has a better prognosis. The standard care for differentiated thyroid cancers typically involves surgery, with or without postoperative radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-140304.r2">[2]</xref> RAI targets cancer cells through the sodium-iodide symporter on these cells, destroying them. The need for and dose of RAI therapy vary based on individual risk factors.</p>
        <p>The mechanisms of action of RAI include:&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Selective uptake by thyroid cells: The thyroid gland is unique in its ability to avidly take up iodine, which it uses to produce thyroid hormones such as thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). This selective uptake is utilized in RAI therapy.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Iodine transporter: Thyroid cells have a specific transporter on their cell membranes, the sodium-iodide symporter, which actively transports iodine into the cells.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>RAI accumulation: During RAI therapy, patients are typically administered iodine-131 (I-131), an isotope chemically identical to stable iodine. This isotope is taken up by thyroid cells in the same manner as non-RAI.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Local radiation: Once inside the thyroid cells, RAI emits &#x003b2;-particles, which are high-energy electrons. These &#x003b2;-particles damage the DNA of thyroid cells, leading to cell death.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Selective destruction of thyroid tissue: RAI&#x000a0;primarily targets thyroid tissue because thyroid cells absorb iodine more effectively than other body cells. This targeted approach for thyroid malignancies selectively destroys cancerous thyroid cells while sparing most other body tissues.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Systemic effects: RAI has both local and systemic effects. A small amount of the unused isotope may be released from the thyroid gland into the bloodstream, where it can be taken up by distant metastases or residual thyroid tissue not removed by surgery. This mechanism helps eliminate remaining cancer cells outside the thyroid gland.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>Overall, RAI's&#x000a0;mechanism of action in thyroid malignancy treatment involves exploiting the unique ability of thyroid cells to take up iodine and selectively destroy cancerous thyroid tissue through local and systemic radiation.</p>

        <title>Anatomy and Physiology</title>
        <p>The embryonic thyroid gland descends from the foramen cecum at the posterior tongue to its final position below the thyroid cartilage, between the C5 and T1 vertebral levels in the midline anterior neck by the 7th week of gestation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-140304.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;The thyroid gland has&#x000a0;2 lobes connected by an isthmus at the level of the second and third tracheal rings.&#x000a0;Approximately 10% to 30% of people have a normal anatomical variant called the "pyramidal lobe," which extends from the isthmus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-140304.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;The thyroid gland is attached to the trachea by the lateral suspensory ligament.&#x000a0;The parathyroid glands and recurrent laryngeal nerves are closely approximated to the posterior thyroid surface.</p>
        <p>Thyroid function relies on the availability of dietary iodine, which is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed in extracellular fluid. Most absorbed iodine is concentrated in thyroid follicular cells via a sodium-iodide symporter. The fetal thyroid starts concentrating iodine at around 12 weeks of gestation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-140304.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-140304.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;Under the influence of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), iodine is conjugated with tyrosine to form T3 and thyroxine (T4). Thyroid hormones are released from the thyroid gland, also under the influence of TSH, and travel to body tissues to regulate cellular metabolism. Iodine is predominantly excreted in the urine, with small amounts also found in feces, sweat, and saliva.</p>
        <p>Each major type of thyroid carcinoma has a distinct pathogenesis. Malignancies derived from thyroid follicular epithelium generally harbor driver mutations that activate protein kinase pathways, promoting carcinogenesis. Most papillary thyroid carcinomas feature activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Follicular thyroid carcinomas frequently exhibit mutations in&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">RAS</italic> or components of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathways.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-140304.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;Progression from well-differentiated to poorly differentiated thyroid cancer typically involves additional mutations that further alter&#x000a0;cellular function.</p>
        <p>Well-differentiated thyroid malignancies retain the ability to absorb iodine&#x000a0;via the sodium-iodide symporter, making RAI an effective therapeutic intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-140304.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;However, anaplastic and poorly differentiated malignancies have decreased&#x000a0;symporter&#x000a0;expression and do not respond well to RAI therapy. Sodium iodide with I-131&#x000a0;induces cellular necroptosis through &#x003b2;-particle emission. Public radiation concerns are due to the &#x003b3;-emission of&#x000a0;364-KeV high-energy photons.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-140304.s4" sec-type="Indications">
        <title>Indications</title>
        <p>RAI treatment is indicated for patients with differentiated thyroid cancer after thyroidectomy. Postoperative disease status must be assessed to optimize patient selection and determine the therapeutic dosing of I-131.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-140304.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;Postoperative disease status assessment includes serum thyroglobulin measurement, neck ultrasound, and diagnostic whole-body&#x000a0;RAI imaging. The&#x000a0;3 primary goals of RAI therapy in well-differentiated thyroid cancers are remnant ablation, adjuvant therapy,&#x000a0;and treatment of known disease. While these goals are listed separately, I-131 used for remnant ablation may also have a tumoricidal effect, and I-131 used for adjuvant treatment may destroy normal remnant thyroid tissue.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-140304.r10">[10]</xref></p>
        <p>Remnant ablation refers to the destruction of presumably benign thyroid tissue after total or subtotal thyroidectomy. This process promotes the accurate interpretation of postoperative I-131 whole-body imaging and serum thyroglobulin levels, reducing confusion between residual thyroid tissue, local disease recurrence, or metastatic disease. Adjuvant treatment refers to additional therapy after surgery to lower the risk of cancer recurrence in patients with an intermediate or high risk of recurrence. Adjuvant therapy improves progression-free survival in patients without obvious evidence of disease but who may have subclinical micrometastases.</p>
        <p>Treating a known disease involves destroying residual cancer or recurrent structural or biochemical disease with either curative or palliative intent. This therapy improves progression-free and overall survival. RAI is appropriate for patients with tumors larger than 2 cm and at least a risk factor, such as obvious extrathyroidal extension, age 45 or older, or lymph node or distant metastases. RAI is also recommended for tumors smaller than 2 cm if distant metastases are evident.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-140304.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;Based on the available data, selecting low- or intermediate-risk patients for remnant ablation or adjuvant treatment is challenging. Patients are classified into low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk categories, as indicated below.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-140304.r12">[12]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Patients With Low Risk</bold>
</p>
        <p>Low-risk patients include individuals with papillary carcinoma who have undergone a gross total thyroidectomy without distant metastases, lymph node involvement, invasion of adjacent structures or blood vessels, or aggressive histology. These patients also lack RAI uptake outside the thyroid bed, palpable lymph nodes, and pathological nodal micrometastases. Other low-risk conditions encompass the encapsulated intrathyroidal follicular variant of papillary thyroid cancer and well-differentiated intrathyroidal follicular carcinoma with capsular invasion, whether or not fewer than 4 foci of vascular invasion are present.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Patients With Intermediate Risk</bold>
</p>
        <p>Intermediate-risk patients typically have aggressive histology types such as Hurthle cell cancer, follicular thyroid cancer, columnar cell or tall cell variants, and insular carcinoma. This group also includes individuals with multifocal papillary microcarcinoma exhibiting extrathyroidal extension and patients with clinically positive lymph nodes less than 3 cm in the largest dimension or more than 5 pathologically positive lymph nodes less than 3 cm in the largest dimension.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Patients With High Risk</bold>
</p>
        <p>High-risk patients include those with incomplete resection, gross extrathyroidal extension, pathologically positive lymph nodes where at least 1&#x000a0;is greater than 3 cm in the largest dimension, distant metastasis, and follicular carcinoma with more than&#x000a0;4 foci of vascular invasion.</p>
        <p>The RAI dose should be determined using an interprofessional approach. Patients without imaging, biochemical, pathological, or clinical evidence of disease after initial definitive curative surgery should either be observed or undergo RAI treatment for remnant ablation or adjuvant therapy, depending on institutional protocols.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-140304.s5" sec-type="Contraindications">
        <title>Contraindications</title>
        <p>Pregnancy and breastfeeding are absolute contraindications for RAI therapy, as the isotope can cross the placenta and cause fetal thyroid damage. Therefore, a pregnancy test must be completed before treating women of childbearing age. Nursing mothers should stop breastfeeding because RAI is secreted through breast milk. Vomiting and diarrhea are also contraindications, as these gastrointestinal disturbances hinder radioiodine absorption and pose a risk of radiation exposure to others. Inefficiency and noncompliance with radiation protection, safety instructions, and recommendations are additional contraindications for therapy. A history of intake of interfering medications, recent imaging using iodinated contrast, and incontinence issues should be properly addressed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-140304.r13">[13]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-140304.r14">[14]</xref></p>
        <p>Patients should be advised on the necessity of radiation protection and procedures to safeguard household members and the general public. The healthcare team should obtain a comprehensive patient history relevant to the disease and any issues that could pose a risk of radiation exposure to others. A thorough pretreatment evaluation can lead to better treatment outcomes and minimize radiation exposure to the public.</p>

As I-131 is primarily excreted through the urinary system, significant renal dysfunction can delay radioactivity clearance, increasing the risk of bone marrow suppression. The patient should fast for at least 2 to 4 hours before and 1 hour after RAI therapy. Informed consent should be obtained after explaining the treatment's purpose, possible adverse effects, the potential need for additional RAI therapy, and the requirement for hormone replacement therapy.</p>
        <p>Radiation safety precautions to reduce exposure to others should be explained, and a written directive should be signed. Women of reproductive age must have a negative pregnancy test before therapy. Nursing mothers should stop breastfeeding entirely, starting 6 weeks before treatment. Patients should be encouraged to drink plenty of water and frequently void to reduce the dose absorbed into the urinary bladder.&#x000a0;</p>

        <p>RAI therapy is typically scheduled at least 3 weeks post-surgery or approximately 4 to 6 weeks after discontinuing levothyroxine to ensure an adequate TSH level. When exogenous TSH administration is necessary, 0.9 mg of rhTSH is injected intramuscularly&#x000a0;for 2 consecutive days, followed by RAI treatment 24 hours later. RAI is commonly administered in pill form. Before administration, the patient's identity should be confirmed. For patients with a low risk of recurrence, a dose of approximately 30 mCi of RAI is generally sufficient for effective ablation.</p>
        <p>The administered dose of RAI must be escalated to a maximum of around 250 mCi for moderate- and high-risk patients. A written informed consent should be obtained from the patient. The dose should be verified by an authorized user before administration. After therapy, the administration area should be surveyed to detect any contamination. Radioactivity released from the patient should be checked with a survey instrument before their discharge from the hospital. The calculation should ensure that the effective dose to caregivers and family members does not exceed 5&#x000a0;mSv before the patient is discharged.</p>
        <p>The patient should drive straight home after therapy, preferably alone. If driving alone is not possible, the patient should choose a seat that maintains maximum distance from others in the vehicle. For 3 to 4 days following treatment, patients should be advised to restrict contact with others, sleep in a separate room, avoid kissing, use a separate bathroom, prevent cross-contamination with sweat and urine, flush the toilet twice after use, wash clothes and utensils separately, and&#x000a0;avoid contact children and pets. Additionally, if the patient works in food service or childcare, they should request an extended leave to minimize radiation exposure to others.</p>
        <p>The long half-life of RAI, which is 8.04 days, allows for imaging several days after therapy. This extended period enables the tracer to concentrate adequately on metastatic lesions, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of the whole-body scan. The patient can return to the nuclear medicine department 3&#x000a0;to 10 days after RAI therapy to obtain a whole-body image. The patient is advised to follow up with an endocrinologist for long-term hormone replacement therapy and other related issues.</p>
        <p>Radiation detection devices may be triggered for several weeks after treatment. Hence, patients planning travel should be given adequate written records of treatment and contact information for the treatment facility.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-140304.r17">[17]</xref> Ablation is typically completed in 4 to 6 months, after which a follow-up I-131 whole-body diagnostic scan can determine the procedure's success.&#x000a0;Retreatment is recommended if the disease persists.</p>

        <p>I-131 treatment-related toxicity can be classified as acute&#x000a0;or chronic. Adverse effects of I-131 are rarely lethal at typical therapeutic doses for thyroid cancer treatment and in the setting of Graves disease. The physiological concentration of I-131 in the thyroid and salivary glands, as well as other organs such as the stomach, can lead to toxicity related to emitted &#x003b2;-particle&#x02013;related locoregional tissue injury. Acute sialadenitis, or salivary gland inflammation, secondary to I-131 therapy is a frequent complication in the acute setting, seen in up to 20% of patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-140304.r18">[18]</xref>&#x000a0;The risk of sialadenitis and xerostomia is dose-dependent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-140304.r19">[19]</xref>&#x000a0;While not standardized, salivary gland stimulation and other measures, such as hydration and using sialagogues, can be utilized to minimize the risk of sialadenitis.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Another acute adverse effect is dysgeusia, or taste dysfunction, secondary to taste bud injury, which can last several days to weeks after treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-140304.r20">[20]</xref>&#x000a0;Oral I-131 may also cause acute radiation gastritis or enteritis after transiting through the stomach and small bowel, most frequently manifesting as nausea. Painful radiation thyroiditis can also occur in patients in the setting of significant residual thyroid tissue in the neck, whether native tissue post-thyroidectomy or papillary or follicular cancer metastasis, often manifesting as neck pain or fever.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-140304.r21">[21]</xref></p>
        <p>Chronic toxicity resulting from I-131 treatment includes the reduction of male fertility due to the radiosensitive nature of live sperm&#x02014;a feature not shared by female oocytes. Other chronic I-131 treatment-related toxicity manifestations include lung fibrosis, chronic xerostomia or sialadenitis, and epiphora secondary to chronic lacrimal gland damage and fibrosis. The risk of leukemia and salivary gland malignancy associated with I-131 treatment is controversial and beyond the scope of this article.</p>

        <title>Clinical Significance</title>
        <p>RAI is diagnostic and therapeutic in thyroid cancer cases, depending on histopathology. About 90% of thyroid cancers are well-differentiated and can take up this isotope. Papillary thyroid carcinoma, the most common type, is twice as common in women than in men and commonly shows lymphomatous spread to the cervical lymph nodes. In contrast, the common route of spread for follicular carcinoma is hematogenous, with frequent metastasis to the lungs and bones and less common spread to the liver and brain. Differentiated thyroid cancer usually has a good prognosis if appropriately treated. Among the differentiated thyroid cancers, Hurthle cell cancer often metastasizes and may not take up RAI.</p>
        <p>Due to the risk of recurrence, the patient may or may not be treated with RAI 6 to 8 weeks after total thyroidectomy, the definitive treatment for thyroid cancer, depending on the histopathology report. Patients may undergo a low-dose whole-body RAI scan approximately 2 months after thyroidectomy to check for any residual thyroid tissue, lymph node metastases, or distal metastases. The treating clinical team can determine the dose for the treatment, depending on the distribution of RAI on the scan.</p>
        <p>Follow-up RAI scans and repeated I-131 treatments may be performed depending on individual cases. A whole-body scan obtained 3 to 10 days after RAI treatment is more sensitive for disease detection than a low-dose whole-body scan due to the higher dose received by the patient. Follow-up of patients with thyroid cancer is usually recommended with serum thyroglobulin level testing. Multiple repeat treatments at 6 months to 1-year intervals monitor complete response, considering the probable adverse effects and dose adjustments. The risk of radiation exposure to the treating staff and household members is high, as I-131 emits high-energy &#x003b3;-radiation and has a long physical half-life. Hence, radiation protection regulations should be strictly followed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-140304.r22">[22]</xref></p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>The appropriate treatment for differentiated thyroid cancer is surgery with or without postoperative RAI therapy. The necessity and amount of RAI to be administered are determined individually, depending on the patient's risk category and institutional protocols. Assessing patient risk, the need for RAI therapy, determining and administering the dosage, maintaining radiation safety protocol, and ensuring the patient complies with the protocol requires an interprofessional team approach. This healthcare team typically includes the primary care clinician, endocrinologist, pathologist, nuclear medicine physician, radiopharmacy and nursing staff, technologists, and radiation safety officer.</p>
        <p>An evidence-based integrated management approach brings superior results. The interprofessional healthcare team should educate the patient about the risks and benefits of RAI treatment and inform them of the importance of following a low-iodine diet before therapy. Efficient clinician-patient communication and proper radiation safety instructions are essential. Small children or pregnant partners should not accompany the patient while visiting for treatment. Female patients of reproductive age should have a negative serum pregnancy test result to proceed with RAI treatment. The patient should be made aware of this therapy's possible short- and long-term adverse effects.</p>
        <p>Having checklists can help explain all aspects of therapy to the patient, improve clinical outcomes, and reduce radiation exposure to the public. Patients should maintain a distance of at least 3 feet from others, especially pregnant women and children, for the first few days after RAI. In addition, patients should be advised to use effective contraception for 6 to 12 months following RAI therapy. Routine follow-up, including thyroglobulin and TSH level testing, as well as RAI diagnostic whole-body scans, is recommended for patients after thyroid cancer treatment. Efficient communication and collaboration among the interprofessional healthcare team members are essential for achieving optimal outcomes.&#x000a0;</p>

        <p>The core objective in managing I-131 radiation risk is to keep exposure levels as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission generally limits each worker&#x02019;s occupational radiation exposure to no more than 5000 mrem annually. This&#x000a0;cumulative exposure is monitored using dosimetry tests from film badges that workers are required to wear on their torsos. Additionally, nuclear licensees, such as hospitals, must limit radiation exposure to members of the public, including hospital visitors, to no more than 100 mrem per year.</p>
        <p>To achieve ALARA exposure rates, the key concepts of time, distance, and shielding are crucial. Time spent exposed to a patient receiving radiation is generally limited to 30 minutes per person per shift. Nurses should bundle care tasks for maximum efficiency and transfer care to other team members once time limits are reached. Each nurse should be assigned to no more than one patient receiving radiation per shift. Patient safety risks, adverse effects, and needs can be frequently assessed via intercom between nursing visits to ensure effective monitoring and minimize radiation exposure.</p>
        <p>Nurses must extensively educate patients receiving I-131 before discharge to fulfill their obligation to minimize exposure to family members and the public. According to the American Thyroid Association guidelines, patients should maintain a personal distance of more than 6 feet from others, avoid sharing personal hygiene items or eating utensils, stay well-hydrated, shower daily for the first 2 days, and use flushable wipes to clean toilets after each use. A 2011 survey by Greenlee et al of 311 physicians and allied practitioners revealed a wide range of safety practices, from minimal to rigorous. While guidelines help mitigate risk, there is ongoing debate about the necessary degree of caution.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-140304.r23">[23]</xref></p>
        <p>As the incidence of iodine administration and thyroid cancer continues to rise, knowledge of radiation safety principles becomes essential for a growing number of nurses. The 3 key principles&#x02014;time, distance, and shielding&#x02014;should be used when caring for patients undergoing radiation treatment. Knowledge of these principles allows nurses to safely assist patients undergoing RAI, minimize occupational risk, and protect the public. Nurses are uniquely positioned to educate the healthcare team, patients, and families on these essential concepts of radiation safety, thereby safeguarding them from unnecessary risks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-140304.r23">[23]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-140304.r24">[24]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-140304.r25">[25]</xref></p>
