        <p>Open airway procedural sedation (OAPS) allows practitioners to perform various procedures in different clinical settings that awake patients would poorly tolerate. There is considerable variability in the practice of OAPS due to the wide array of practitioners performing OAPS, the procedures taking place, and the setting in which it is being carried out. However, the principles remain unchanged and will therefore be the focus of this activity, which will cover important considerations in the pre-operative assessment of patients before OAPS, required equipment, common agents and techniques utilized during OAPS, as well the management of common intra-operative and post-operative issues encountered during OAPS.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Several professional organizations have made numerous attempts to define open airway procedural sedation (OAPS). Although minor differences can be seen among these definitions, their common elements can be utilized to formulate a comprehensive definition of OAPS, which can be summarized as the facilitation of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures by providing anxiolysis, analgesia, akinesia, or amnesia through the administration of&#x000a0;1 or more pharmacological agents to maintain airway patency and protective reflexes, spontaneous breathing, as well as hemodynamic stability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133112.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Substantial variability exists in the practice of OAPS, which is performed by practitioners with varying backgrounds and skill levels in various clinical settings. It is important to review core principles that remain unchanged irrespective of these variables.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-133112.s3" sec-type="Anatomy and Physiology">
        <title>Anatomy and Physiology</title>
        <p>Practitioners performing OAPS should possess foundational knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of all body systems. Along with this foundational knowledge, intimate knowledge of normal airway anatomy and potential variations is of utmost importance as most severe complications that occur during OAPS, however rare, involve the respiratory system. In a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the incidence of adverse events occurring during the procedural sedation of adults in the emergency department, aspiration and laryngospasm were the&#x000a0;2 most common severe adverse events that required emergent medical intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133112.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>As such, all practitioners performing OAPs should be well-versed in the pre-sedation airway assessment to identify patients who may be difficult to ventilate or intubate. Although there is no single best predictor of difficulty in bag-mask ventilation and intubation, one should be familiar with the commonly assessed variables during the pre-sedation airway evaluation, which has proven useful predictors. These variables include the presence of a beard, age &#x0003e;55, history of snoring, obesity, and edentulism.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133112.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>For many reasons, patients with restricted mouth openings of less than 2.5 cm are poor candidates for OAPS. These include the potential inability to visualize and suction the oral cavity and oropharynx, the potential inability to insert certain airway adjuncts, and the potential inability to perform direct laryngoscopy for intubation. A thorough history of prior airway procedures or congenital malformations should be obtained. The most commonly utilized scale for pre-anesthetic upper airway anatomy assessment is the Mallampati score, a visual grading scale ranging from I-IV, which looks at the distance/space between the base of the tongue to the soft palate, with scores greater than III/IV being more predictive of a potentially difficult airway and intubation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133112.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;If there are any concerns for potential airway challenges, practitioners should, at the very minimum, re-evaluate the appropriate clinical setting for OAPS in these patients, with a stronger inclination towards hospital/inpatient settings.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-133112.s4" sec-type="Indications">
        <title>Indications</title>
        <p>Although there are no absolute indications for OAPS, it should be considered for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures associated with significant physical or emotional discomfort. According to the parameters outlined by the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the depth of sedation for OAPS ranges from minimal sedation or "anxiolysis" to deep sedation. The depth required for each patient is determined by multiple considerations, including the&#x000a0;level of pain anticipated and the need for akinesia.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-133112.s5" sec-type="Contraindications">
        <title>Contraindications</title>
        <p>There are no universally accepted guidelines that outline strict/absolute contraindications for OAPS, as many life-saving procedures need to be performed on patients regardless of their underlying comorbidities. Nonetheless, a thorough&#x000a0;and pertinent history and physical exam should be performed on every patient to assess the&#x000a0;patient's overall perioperative health. The ASA Physical Status Classification System, created in 1941, is a valuable grading system that is used to evaluate and communicate a patient's level of overall perioperative health before surgery and the administration of anesthesia:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>ASA class I represents normal, healthy patients</p>

            <p>ASA class II represents patients with mild systemic disease(s)</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>ASA class III represents patients with severe systemic disease(s)</p>

          <list-item>
            <p>ASA class IV represents patients with severe systemic disease(s) that pose a constant threat to life</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>ASA class V represents patients who are moribund and not expected to survive without the operation</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>ASA class IV represents patients who are declared brain-dead and whose organs are being harvested for donor purposes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133112.r5">[5]</xref></p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>Additionally, multiple tools can aid in the perioperative risk stratification of patients before surgery and anesthesia. Examples include the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) calculator&#x000a0;and the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133112.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133112.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Alternative anesthetic techniques should be considered for patients with significant comorbidities, and careful consideration should be given to the setting where anesthesia is being administered. For example, anesthesia for patients considered ASA III and beyond might be best administered in the hospital/inpatient rather than outpatient clinic setting. Additionally, OAPS should only be performed by those with the appropriate training and certification outlined by their governing bodies.</p>

        <title>Technique or Treatment</title>
        <p>An ideal anesthetic agent should possess analgesic, sedative, and amnestic properties with a rapid onset and short duration of action, allowing for quick recovery and discharge of patients. Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, no such single agent that possesses all of these properties exists. Therefore, it is common practice to utilize a combination of agents to carry out OAPS, although single-agent OAPS is not uncommon. For example, while there is no standard regimen, most practitioners utilize a combination of a short-acting benzodiazepine such as midazolam and an opioid such as fentanyl for OAPS in adult patients, taking advantage of the anxiolytic, sedative, and amnestic properties of benzodiazepines, and the analgesic properties of opioids. That being said, numerous other medications are often employed, either as sole agents or in combination, like ketofol (ketamine and propofol). Many studies have shown this combination to have fewer adverse effects like respiratory depression compared with single-use agents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133112.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133112.r10">[10]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133112.r11">[11]</xref></p>

        <p>Knowledge of these&#x000a0;4 medications gives any provider a good foundation of OAPS techniques. Many other agents can be utilized during OAPS for specific reasons, but these are beyond the scope of this topic.</p>

        <title>Complications</title>
        <p>The most commonly encountered complications involve maintaining a patent airway or managing a compromised airway. Examples&#x000a0;include respiratory depression-related hypoxia, emesis and aspiration, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, and allergic reactions/anaphylaxis. Other less common but severe complications include seizures, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and stroke. All providers must have the skills, equipment, and knowledge to manage these conditions emergently and transfer to a higher level of care when appropriate. A comprehensive knowledge base in pre-operative assessment/patient selection, airway management, ACLS, PALS, and anesthesia is critical in mitigating and managing the complications of OAPS. In addition, monthly reviews of emergency scenarios and their management can reduce adverse outcomes to airway-related complications.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>For example, one should know the signs and symptoms of laryngospasm, including inspiratory stridor, loss of end-tidal CO2 waveform, and hypoxia. It should be managed algorithmically to ensure the patient maintains adequate oxygenation and recovers ventilation. This is done by delivering continuous positive airway pressure by Bag Valve Mask (BVM), increasing the depth of anesthesia, and finally administering an initial partial dose of succinylcholine (0.1&#x000a0;to 0.5 mg/kg IV) and, ultimately, a full dose (1&#x000a0;to 1.5 mg/kg IV) for attempted intubation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133112.r15">[15]</xref></p>

        <title>Clinical Significance</title>
        <p>When executed by a well-trained and knowledgeable practitioner, regardless of training background, OAPS can be a safe, efficient, and humane way of performing procedures that would otherwise be intolerable due to pain, discomfort, or emotional stress.</p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>The practice of open-airway procedural sedation is a prime example of the practice of medicine as a team sport, requiring all those involved to be in sync with one another during all phases of care, operating as a cohesive interprofessional team. The individuals performing the procedure and the sedation, if not the same person, should be in regular communication to provide the highest level of care, as various levels of sedation are required during specific stages of each procedure. Additionally, attentiveness from well-trained ancillary support staff leads to improved workflow and identification of potential perioperative issues that may have gone unnoticed. This interprofessional approach leads to improved patient outcomes with open-airway procedural sedation.</p>
