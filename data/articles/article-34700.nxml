        <p content-type="pubmed-excerpt">The American Nurses Association&#x000a0;(ANA) defines standards for registered nurses. The <italic toggle="yes">Nursing Professional Development (NPD): Scope and Standards of Practice </italic>describe the competencies that NPD practitioners should perform. The roles of all nursing specialties, including those of NPD practitioners, are evolving with the changing healthcare landscape. The ANA and other specialty organizations periodically review and revise standards. The latest edition of the NPD scope and&#x000a0;standards was published in 2022 by the Association for Nursing Professional Development.</p>
        <p>A diverse, global group of NPD practitioners was convened to update these standards. They used research findings from Harper and Maloney in the spring of 2020&#x000a0;and other current literature to ensure that the new standards reflected current and future NPD practices.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34700.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34700.r2">[2]</xref> Harper and Maloney used a mixed-methods study to identify the utility and challenges of the 3rd edition of the scope and standards, current and future issues and trends impacting NPD practice, and skills and competencies needed by NPD practitioners over the next five years. They followed that with a Delphi method study to obtain consensus on the world caf&#x000e9; items and inform this update on the NPD scope and standards.</p>
        <p>The current standards' definition of NPD was updated to state, "Nursing professional development is a nursing practice specialty that improves the professional practice and role competence of nurses and other healthcare personnel by facilitating ongoing learning, change, and role competence and growth with the intention of improving population health through indirect care" (p. 1).&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The revised standards include an updated systems practice model comprised of inputs, throughputs, and outputs. Rainford et al described the practice model and changes in the latest standards edition. Inputs include environmental scanning, the learner, the&#x000a0;7 NPD roles, and the NPD standards. Throughputs include the organizational mission and vision and NPD practitioners'&#x000a0;6 key areas of responsibility, which include</p>

        <p>Outputs include learning, change, and professional role competence and growth, which contribute to optimal care and population health. The focus of NPD practice is the healthcare consumer&#x000a0;or partner, who is defined as a "patient, person, client, family, group, community, or population who collaborates with the interprofessional healthcare team and maintains autonomy to engage in decision-making about activities/treatments/therapies to promote health" (p. 119).</p>
        <p>Three years after the 2016 standards were published, Harper and Maloney identified that although the standards have promoted uniformity of titles and alignment with the scope of practice, the specialty needs more advocacy, research, and engagement work.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34700.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;In an article about the development of the updated edition,&#x000a0;they outlined some of the work done to inform the latest standards edition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34700.r4">[4]</xref></p>

          <list-item>
            <p><bold>NPD practitioner:&#x000a0;</bold>The definition of NPD practitioner expanded to include NPD practice judgment.

        <p>Dickerson and Durkin&#x000a0;describe how the first&#x000a0;6 standards apply the nursing process framework to NPD practice.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34700.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Standard 1</bold>
</p>
        <p>The first standard, Assessment, broadened the process to include using evidence-based assessment techniques to guide relevant data collection. Other additions include creating a safe environment for competency assessment and keeping abreast of technological advances that could influence assessment from&#x000a0;the span of assessment for the NPD specialist's "department, organization, system and community dynamics"&#x000a0;(p. 5).&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Standard 2</bold>
</p>
        <p>Standard 2, Diagnosis, discusses analyzing assessment data to identify actual and potential practice gaps that could impact the performance of healthcare team members. Differentiating professional development issues from system or compliance issues was emphasized. The difference between the NPD practitioner and specialist is in their scope: the NPD practitioner focuses on the individual or unit level, whereas the specialist considers departmental and organizational needs.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Standard 3</bold>
</p>
        <p>Standard 3, Outcomes Identification, focuses on developing measurable outcomes for a plan to meet the diagnosed needs. Learners and other key stakeholders are involved in formulating measurable, evidence-based, context-specific outcomes. These outcomes reflect the values of the organization, stakeholders, and learners and align with regulations.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Standard&#x000a0;4</bold>
</p>
        <p>Standard 4, Planning, includes developing NPD initiatives, respecting diversity, using instructional design principles, and preparing content reflective of expected outcomes using current evidence. The NPD practitioner is competent in planning interprofessional initiatives and using NPD practice judgment to prioritize plan elements. In addition, the NPD specialist uses systems thinking throughout the planning process.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Standard 5</bold>
</p>
        <p>Standard 5, Implementation, has&#x000a0;2 subcomponents: standard 5-A, Coordination, and standard 5-B, Health Teaching and Health Promotion. This standard ensures quality and safety for the healthcare consumer&#x000a0;or partner. In addition to using practice judgment, the NPD practitioner adjusts implementation strategies recognizing the learner&#x02019;s needs, readiness, ability to learn, language, and cultural preferences.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Standard 5-A&#x000a0;</bold>
</p>
        <p>Competencies in standard 5-A&#x000a0;include coordination and recognizing the role of others, including stakeholders, professional development associates, and interprofessional team members, in implementing the plan and associated processes. There is also a competency for transitions in practice and to practice, including preceptor preparation and assignment.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Standard 5-B</bold>
</p>
        <p>Competencies in the new standard 5-B, health teaching and health promotion, outline how the NPD practitioner can focus on teaching and promoting wellness strategies. This standard's basis is the role of the NPD practitioner in promoting healthy lifestyles, disease prevention, and self-care in learners and providing education to help clinical staff promote wellness in their healthcare consumers&#x000a0;or partners.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Standard 6</bold>
</p>
        <p>Standard 6, Evaluation, addresses the achievement of progress towards attaining outcomes. The NPD practitioner evaluates the outcomes of the established plan, where the NPD specialist focuses on process and impact. Using appropriate methods and instruments, the NPD practitioner analyzes, documents, and disseminates the results of evaluation data. The NPD specialist synthesizes the evaluation data to determine the impact on the health of healthcare consumers&#x000a0;or partners and the population.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Standards 7-18&#x000a0;</bold>
</p>
        <p>Standards 7-18 describe professional performance or a competent level of behavior in the professional role. All registered nurses are expected to engage in professional role activities, including leadership and mentorship, which reflect their education, experience, and position.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Standard 7</bold>
</p>
        <p>Standard 7, Ethics, emphasizes the importance of following the <italic toggle="yes">Code of Ethics for Nurses</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice,</italic> and other regulatory standards to guide practice. This standard incorporates the concept of social justice and respectful, compassionate treatment in practice, as well as safeguarding sensitive information. The specialist analyzes ethical issues and provides leadership when addressing ethical issues.</p>
        <p><bold>Standard</bold>
<bold>8</bold></p>
        <p>Standard 8, Advocacy, is a new standard in this edition. ANA defines advocacy in the <italic toggle="yes">Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice </italic>as "the act or process of pleading for, supporting, or recommending a cause or course of action. Advocacy may be for persons (whether an individual, group, population or society) or an issue, such as potable water or global health." p. 109. The NPD practitioner demonstrates advocacy in all roles and settings. This includes championing the voice of the healthcare consumer&#x000a0;or partner and promoting the value of NPD practice. The NPD specialist advances NPD as a specialty and engages with interprofessional colleagues and professional organizations to advance NPD practice.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Standard 9</bold>
</p>
        <p>Another new standard, Standard 9, is respectful and equitable practice, which stresses the importance of cultural humility and social equity, resisting systemic racism, and demonstrating diversity, equity, and inclusion in one&#x02019;s practice. The current standards indicate that the specialist develops partnerships to promote allyship, defined as "a lifelong process of building relationships based on trust, consistency, and accountability with marginalized individuals or groups"&#x000a0;(p. 116).</p>
        <p>
<bold>Standard 10</bold>
</p>
        <p>Standard 10 focuses on communication. Communication-related concepts were intertwined throughout many of the standards in the previous version but are elevated to a separate standard in the updated edition. The NPD practitioner must communicate effectively with all healthcare personnel in the practice and learning environments. This includes using evidence-based tools and providing nonjudgmental, specific feedback to others.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Standard 11</bold>
</p>
        <p>Standard 11, Collaboration, describes the interaction between the NPD practitioner, colleagues, academic partners, and other key stakeholders. This includes partnering with others to effect change and promote population health. The NPD specialist advances interprofessional collaboration using NPD practice judgment and expertise.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Standard 12</bold>
</p>
        <p>Standard 12, leadership, defines leadership competencies within the interprofessional practice and learning environments and the profession and includes competencies for change management. This standard encompasses formal and informal leadership and includes the concepts of emotional intelligence, shared decision-making, and just culture. The NPD specialist creates and sustains mentoring processes, leads change, and advances a culture of innovation, organizational learning, and continuous professional development. Johnson and Smith&#x000a0;discussed preparing NPD practitioners for their leadership roles, focusing on management and leadership skills.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34700.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Standard 13</bold>
</p>
        <p>Standard 13, Education, focuses on the ongoing professional learning of the NPD practitioner as they seek knowledge and competence that reflects current NPD practice and promotes futuristic thinking. This standard also addresses the value of reflective practice and inquiry, precepting, and seeking NPD certification.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Standard 14</bold>
</p>
        <p>Standard 14, Scholarly Inquiry, formerly evidence-based practice (EBP), focuses on integrating scholarship, evidence, and research findings into NPD practice. Acting as a champion of scientific inquiry, participating in inquiry at various levels, and disseminating inquiry findings are some of the competencies of this standard. The NPD specialist applies principles of implementation science, leads quality and safety initiatives, and mentors others in inquiry.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Standard 15</bold>
</p>
        <p>Standard 15, Quality of Practice, describes the contributions of the NPD practitioner to quality nursing, healthcare, and NPD practice. This includes mentoring others, using quality improvement processes to enhance nursing, healthcare, and NPD practice, and reporting outcomes of professional development initiatives. The NPD specialist analyzes NPD department quality outcomes to demonstrate impact, models expert practice, and synthesizes evaluation data to guide decision-making.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Standard 16</bold>
</p>
        <p>Standard 16, Professional Practice Evaluation, pertains to NPD practitioners evaluating their own and others' nursing practice. This involves reflection and self-evaluation, facilitating learners&#x02019; identification of their professional development needs, and engaging in systematic peer review. The NPD specialist develops standards and guidelines for NPD practice evaluation.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Standard 17</bold>
</p>
        <p>Standard 17, Resource Stewardship, previously resource utilization, involves the NPD practitioner using appropriate resources to plan, provide, and sustain evidence-based NPD initiatives that are safe, effective, financially responsible, and used judiciously. This includes identifying resources needed, monitoring resource allocation and utilization, and considering quality, effectiveness, and cost factors in planning, implementing, and evaluating NPD initiatives. The NPD specialist analyzes the cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit, and return on investment associated with NPD practice.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Standard 18</bold>
</p>
        <p>Standard 18, environmental health, concerning environmental safety and health within the practice and learning environments, is another new standard in this edition. Incorporating the social determinants of health into the interprofessional practice and learning environment, addressing bullying and incivility, and promoting the use of emotional intelligence are included in this standard. The NPD specialist establishes best practices for creating and sustaining positive interprofessional and learning environments and creates processes that support seamless transitions to practice and between practice settings.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Role Differentiation</bold>
</p>
        <p>There is often confusion about the differences in the roles of the NPD practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, academic clinical nurse educator, and academic educator. A table comparing these various nursing specialties is a much-needed resource created for this edition. The table compares the definition, requirements, certification&#x000a0;or secondary licensure, and roles&#x000a0;and responsibilities of each group to clarify the differences in these roles.</p>
        <p>Another excellent resource is a table providing examples of how NPD roles are used in each area of responsibility. Although NPD roles vary depending on one&#x02019;s setting and practice area, this table provides concrete examples of how the NPD practitioner meets the various responsibilities in each role.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Certification</bold>
</p>
        <p>Competencies for the NPD specialist in all standards provide a framework for the advanced certification in nursing professional development, a portfolio-based certification exam offered by the Competency and Credentialing Institute. Di Leonardi outlined information about this exam,[7] and&#x000a0;Harper and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34700.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;wrote an article on developing this advanced certification.&#x000a0;</p>

        <title>Clinical Significance</title>
        <p>The scope of practice for the NPD practitioner reflects the changing landscape in healthcare. NPD practitioners can use these standards to achieve the outputs of NPD practice: learning, change, and professional role competence. This provides energy for optimal care outcomes and population health, benefiting the healthcare consumer&#x000a0;or partner. NPD practitioners incorporate considerations for diversity, equity, and inclusion into their initiatives to ensure that all healthcare staff is prepared to address social and digital determinants of health in healthcare consumers/partners. All NPD practitioners must know of and adhere to the NPD standards of practice. NPD practitioners can use them in various ways to enhance NPD practice and advance the specialty.

The healthcare landscape constantly evolves on several fronts, and new standards of care emerge constantly. Nursing staff cannot remain static in their development, or they will be left behind as newer nurses enter the field armed with the latest knowledge, techniques, and standards of care. Nurses must keep pace to ensure optimal patient care results from improved standards.&#x000a0;</p>
