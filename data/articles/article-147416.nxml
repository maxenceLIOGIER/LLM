        <p>Silica is the most plentiful mineral on earth and is the primary constituent in most rocks. The respirable form of silica is small enough to reach the terminal bronchioles and alveoli of the respiratory system. Typical immune mechanisms cannot clear these particles from the lung, initiating a pathologic cycle of inflammation and parenchymal damage that ultimately leads to silicosis. Silicosis is the world's most prevalent occupational lung disease and is characterized by irreversible, progressive pulmonary fibrosis leading to restrictive lung disease. Silicosis is a preventable disease with significant morbidity and mortality that has no cure. Education on prevention, screening, timely diagnosis, avoidance of exacerbating factors, and treatment of complications is imperative. This activity reviews the etiology, epidemiology, pathogenesis, pathophysiology, clinical evaluation, and management of silicosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this occupational pneumoconiosis.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Silica, or silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>), comprises a&#x000a0;silicon atom and 2 oxygen atoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Silica is the most plentiful mineral on Earth,&#x000a0; distributed throughout the Earth's crust as silicate minerals. Silica is the main constituent of more than 95% of rocks and stones.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Occupational exposure to silica dust is one of the oldest known forms of lung disease,&#x000a0;first documented by Hippocrates in 400 BC describing breathing disorders in metal diggers.&#x000a0;In the 1600s, van Diemerbrock noted the harmful effects of inhaling granite dust. Ramazzini provided a detailed description in the 1700s of the lung scarring observed in stone and coal workers. During the industrial revolution, advancing mechanization of production techniques increased workers' risk of contact with higher concentrations of silica dust. In 1832, it was noted that sandstone workers had significantly shorter life expectancies compared to limestone and brick workers, often dying by the age of 40. The Hawks Nest Tunnel disaster of the 1930s was one of the worst industrial disasters in American history. To create a large tunnel that would redirect a river to power a hydroelectric plant in West Virginia, workers drilled through rock in a confined space without ventilation or respiratory protection. Many developed disabling lung damage within a few months due to exposure to high silica concentrations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>The burden of silica-associated disease remains high, and silicosis is currently the world's most prevalent chronic occupational disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Many industries place&#x000a0;workers at risk of&#x000a0;inhaling silica-containing dust, including abrasive blasting, denim jean manufacture, artificial stone production, brickwork, pottery, porcelain work, tunneling, mining, and structural construction and demolition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>Silica exists in amorphous and crystalline forms that&#x000a0;have unique physiochemical properties.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;Amorphic silica&#x000a0;is found in biological&#x000a0;matter such as plants, sponges, algae, fungi, and bacteria and nonvegetative matter such as volcanic glass, colloidal sols, and powders.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Amorphic silica is not considered toxic.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Crystalline silica is a mineral commonly known as quartz, present in granite and sandstone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;In contrast to the random orientation of molecules in amorphous silica, crystalline silica exhibits a fixed, repeating, polymerized silicon-oxygen tetrahedral framework. Crystalline silica exists in&#x000a0;various forms, including &#x003b1;-quartz, &#x003b2;-quartz, &#x003b1;-tridymite, &#x003b2;-tridymite, &#x003b1;-cristobalite, &#x003b2;-cristobalite, keatite, coesite, stishovite, and moganite. &#x003b1;-Quartz is the most common crystalline silica and the most biologically toxic form.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>Particles of crystalline silica are considered biologically active when small enough in diameter to reach the distal bronchioles and alveoli of the lungs. Such particles are denoted as "respirable crystalline silica" (RCS) and are less than 5 &#x003bc;m in diameter.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;RCS is released into the atmosphere by crushing, grinding, or cutting silica-containing matter.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;RCS can easily go unnoticed as it is odorless, colorless, and nonirritating. In 1997, the International Agency for Research on Cancer labeled RCS as a human carcinogen.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>Silica also exists as "silica nanoparticles" (SiNPs), particles of nanoform silicon dioxide that measure less than 100 nm in diameter. SiNPs have physiochemical characteristics distinct from the bulk form of silica.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;SiNPs are colloidal metal oxides comprising a siloxane (Si-O-Si-O) core with abundant silanol (Si-OH) surface groups. SiNPs are either mesoporous or solid. The silica matrix of mesoporous SiNPs has many channels and pores, whereas solid SiNPs have no pores.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;Mesoporous SiNPs have a controllable, uniform pore size, large volume-to-surface ratio, easily modifiable surface chemistry, and exceptional biocompatibility.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;The silica framework of SiNPs yields many advantageous qualities, such as its stability in acidic conditions, temperature fluctuations, and organic solvents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;The pores of mesoporous SiNPs can be filled with various biomolecules.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>Silicosis, a type of pneumoconiosis, occurs secondary to the inhalation of RCS and causes&#x000a0;progressive, irreversible, and fatal lung inflammation and fibrosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;While the condition is preventable, no treatment exists.&#x000a0;Silicosis increases susceptibility to Mycobacterial diseases, autoimmune diseases, and bronchogenic carcinoma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;This activity reviews the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical findings, evaluation, and management of patients with silicosis.</p>

        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>The many diverse forms of silica can be used in various ways. The Consumer Federation of America and the United States Food and Drug Administration have deemed amorphous silica and salicylates safe for human use when manufactured in larger, non-respirable particle sizes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;These non-respirable particles are often used in hair, skin, and nail products.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r10">[10]</xref> Since the early 1990s, denim and artificial stone production have been some of&#x000a0;the largest silica-based industries. Denim is often sandblasted with minerals containing silica particles to obtain a look of worn- or washed-out denim. Artificial stone, commonly used for countertops and benchtops, comprises quartz, decorative glass, and metal pieces bound by a polymer resin. The crystalline silica component constitutes over 90% of the finished stone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;These contemporary manufacturing processes have contributed to the reemergence of silicosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>SiNPs are frequently used in the cosmetic, food, and agriculture industries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0; SiNPs are also used in the production of processed foods and food storage. The average daily consumption of silica from foodstuffs is approximately 9.4 mg/kg. Amorphous silica is an anti-caking, anti-foaming,&#x000a0;or flow-aiding agent in powdered foods such as cake mixes or spices. Silica is also occasionally used as an aroma carrier or filtering agent. There are future opportunities for silica nano-additives to adjust specific properties of food, including taste, texture, and shelf life. SiNPs could also be used to fortify essential foods with vitamins and nutrients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r10">[10]</xref></p>
        <p>SiNPs have become powerful medical tools with diagnostic and therapeutic applications in cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;SiNPs can provide improved clearance, solubility, and targeted release of drugs. The adjustable surface chemistry of silica particles enables diverse surface modifications, which alter drug biodistribution and pharmacokinetics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;For example, the reactive silanol groups on the surface of the silica can be conjugated with biomolecules, such as organic groups, antibodies, or DNA, to functionalize the nanoparticles and allow them to bind target surfaces or cells or to evade the reticuloendothelial system, thus providing longer circulation times.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>SiNPs have also become invaluable in imaging studies, allowing for less invasive diagnostic studies and speeding up treatment-based decision-making.&#x000a0;Most imaging dyes are hydrophobic, making them incompatible with the aqueous environment of the body. However, the hydrophobic dye particles are trapped in the silica matrix, which protects them from direct contact with the environment and increases their stability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Little is known about the adverse effects of SiNPs, and there is inadequate evidence to draw any firm conclusions about their toxicity except that toxicity is likely multifactorial and affected by surface modifications, pore size, particle size, route of exposure, and dosage.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r10">[10]</xref></p>

        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>Between 1991 and 1995, more than 500,000 individuals in China alone were diagnosed with silica-related lung disease. The World Health Organization pledged in 1995 to eliminate silicosis by the year 2030, but silicosis currently remains a prominent health issue internationally.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Cumulative respiratory exposure to silica has been identified as the primary factor associated with the development of lung pathology and is impacted by the exposure duration and intensity. Occupational exposure to RCS is regulated by most countries by the time-weighted average (TWA). The TWA is the average concentration of an airborne substance encountered over an average work week of 40 hours. Generally, the accepted exposure limit of RCS is between 0.05 mg/m<sup>3</sup> to 0.1 mg/m<sup>3</sup>. However, it was proven in 2002 that even at&#x000a0;exposure levels equal to a TWA of 0.05 mg/m<sup>3</sup>&#x000a0;over a working&#x000a0;career of 40 to 45 years, workers still had a significant risk of at least 1 in 100 developing radiographic silicotic lung disease.</p>
        <p>Although short-term exposures are not generally regulated, even short periods of exposure to high concentrations of RCS markedly increase&#x000a0;the risk&#x000a0;of developing silicosis. It is generally recommended that the RCS level not surpass 3 times the 8-hour TWA for more than 30 minutes and should certainly never exceed&#x000a0;5 times the 8-hour TWA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>The newer industries of sand-blasting denim and engineered stone have been associated with alarmingly high rates of silicosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;In the United States, individuals who work with artificial stone countertops are frequently exposed to hazardous concentrations of silica dust released into the air with cutting, drilling, grinding, and polishing stone slabs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;One study revealed that grinding or cutting artificial stone without water dust suppression produced&#x000a0;nearly 300 times the recommended 30-minute TWA exposure limit.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Studies have also indicated a significant increase in the prevalence of autoimmune disease in patients with silicosis&#x000a0;from occupational exposure to the artificial stone industry.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r2">[2]</xref> Certain smaller industries or hobbies, such as ceramics or pottery, may also be associated with exposure to substantial RCS levels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>Although SiNPs show much promise, little is known about their potential adverse effects on humans. In vitro and in vivo studies have&#x000a0;demonstrated that SiNPs can induce inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;However, these studies&#x000a0;evaluated SiNPs with various physiochemical properties, likely contributing to the significant variations in their toxicity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;Further research must be&#x000a0;done, as the increasing production and usage of SiNPs will increase human exposure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>

        <p>Long-term occupational exposure to&#x000a0;RCS&#x000a0;is associated with the development of silicosis, a devastating interstitial lung disease characterized by diffuse pulmonary fibrosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>RCS particles are small enough to&#x000a0;bypass the pulmonary mucociliary defense system and into the terminal airways and alveoli, where they are coated with pulmonary surfactant.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;The surfactant is believed to modify the surface chemistry of the particles in a protective manner, temporarily decreasing their toxicity. In response to immune stimulation by the silica particles, alveolar macrophages influence alveolar type II cells and bronchiolar epithelial cells to produce a copious amount of surfactant. However, the protective effect of the surfactant against silica-induced lung damage is only temporary, lasting approximately 3 days, after which the surfactant undergoes enzymatic proteinaceous digestion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The sustained overproduction of surfactant and the accumulation of the denatured protein is an acute pathological feature of silica exposure.

        <p>In the terminal airways, the RCS particles are engulfed by alveolar macrophages to clear the lung of the inhaled debris.

        <p>Three major forms of silicosis have been described, each distinguished by the latency period between the initial exposure to RCS and the onset of symptoms. Histopathological disease occurs before the onset of radiological or clinical disease. The&#x000a0;3 major forms of silicosis are acute, accelerated, and chronic. Chronic silicosis, the most commonly encountered form of silicosis, is also known as classic silicosis and may be simple or complicated. Complicated chronic silicosis is also known as pulmonary massive fibrosis (PMF).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>All patients with silicosis will have a history of exposure to RCS.&#x000a0;Professions with a particularly high risk of excessive&#x000a0;RCS exposure include quartz millers, abrasive blasting, denim jean manufacture, brick masons, miners, potters, ceramicists, and those who help construct underground subways and dams.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;However, many patients with silicosis are asymptomatic with a normal physical examination, making clinical suspicion based on occupational history imperative.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r13">[13]</xref> Symptoms and physical examination findings, if present, are often dictated by the form of silicosis present.</p>
        <p>Acute silicosis or silicoproteinosis is a rare condition only observed in patients with high-intensity RCS exposure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r16">[16]</xref>&#x000a0;Acute silicosis usually presents within a few weeks to less than 5 years after RCS exposure. While anyone with high-intensity exposure to RCS may develop silicoproteinosis, it is most commonly identified in individuals who have performed abrasive sandblasting or work in tunnels. The pathology of acute silicosis is unique and is characterized by significant alveolitis and alveolar proteinosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Patients with acute silicosis are generally symptomatic, reporting pulmonary and systemic symptoms, including dyspnea, pleurisy, cough, fevers, fatigue, and weight loss.

        <p>There is no specific laboratory test to diagnose silicosis; the diagnosis rests on a history of&#x000a0;RCS&#x000a0;exposure and consistent radiological features.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Chest radiographs are often performed first in evaluating suspected occupational lung disease, as radiographs are inexpensive, widely available, and administer a low radiation dose. As most patients with silicosis are asymptomatic,&#x000a0;the first signs of disease&#x000a0;are often discovered on chest radiography as part of an occupational health screen or as an incidental finding.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0; Chest radiography may reveal multiple nodules in the middle and upper lungs bilaterally, often with enlargement of the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r13">[13]</xref> However, chest radiography is often unable to detect early disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;High-resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) is more sensitive during early disease stages and provides greater diagnostic confidence (see&#x000a0;<bold>Image.</bold> Silicosis, Computed Tomography).</p>
        <p>Features consistent with chronic simple silicosis include well-defined nodules less than 10 mm in diameter. These nodules are characteristically located in the upper lobes&#x000a0;and may be accompanied by mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with nodules in the peri-lymphatic distribution. Radiological features consistent with chronic complicated silicosis include conglomerate masses greater than 10 mm in diameter. These masses are usually located in the posterior apical lung and may migrate toward the hilum. These large nodules often have irregular margins, vary in shape, and can lead to lung volume loss with mediastinal or tracheal distortion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r16">[16]</xref></p>
        <p>Knowledge of the specific radiographical features of acute silicosis is limited to a small number of case series and reports. Radiographic features that may be revealed with HRCT imaging include numerous bilateral centrilobular nodular and ground-glass opacities. If there is also focal consolidation with air bronchograms caused by a buildup of intra-alveolar material and alveolar and septal wall thickening, the images may show a &#x0201c;crazy-paving&#x0201d; pattern.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147416.r16">[16]</xref></p>
