        <p>Osteoarthritis is a common condition involving articular surfaces that can develop gradually over time into a debilitating condition that causes pain and restriction of motion. An estimated 80% of Americans have an episode of low back pain during their lifetime. Low back pain is among the most common causes of healthcare visits in the United States, accounting for over 45 million trips in 2006. Spine osteoarthritis is a primary source of chronic low back pain. While most cases of spine arthritis-related pain are self-limited, requiring only conservative therapy, chronic back pain treatment involves significant healthcare dollars. In 2016, patients in the United States spent an estimated $380 billion on low back and neck pain. $3.1 trillion, about 17.9% of the gross domestic product, was spent on this diagnosis. This activity reviews the interprofessional team's role in treating spinal osteoarthritis. It discusses its prevalence in the United States and other parts of the world and its clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, complications, treatment options, and potential preventative factors.</p>

        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>Despite the lack of evidence to delineate a specific etiology and pathogenesis of spine arthritis, several risk factors are critical in its development. Osteoarthritis traditionally was thought to be a disorder directly linked to "wear and tear." Degenerative changes over time were theorized to lead to osteophyte&#x000a0;formation&#x000a0;and cartilage loss.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;However, more modern advances in technology have aided in our understanding of this disorder. The etiology of spine osteoarthritis is likely secondary to its multifactorial pathogenesis. Its etiology includes genetic predisposition, epigenetics, dietary changes, sex, and ethnicity differences. Patient age, muscle strength, physical activity, and work-related habits are factors in osteoarthritis development. Together these factors contribute to a low-grade inflammatory state and potentiate degenerative change. Furthermore, the overtraining of muscles with abnormal joint movements can lead to injury, changes to joint alignment, and worsening arthritis. Congenital abnormalities such as the increased sagittal orientation of the facet joints or increased pelvic girth, and unusual lordotic angles also contribute to osteoarthritic degeneration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r10">[10]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r11">[11]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r12">[12]</xref></p>
        <p>Genetically, researchers have linked over 80 gene mutations involved in osteoarthritis. The 143383 nucleotide polymorphism is arguably the most critical, secondary to its role in developing, maintaining, and repairing synovial joints.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;The heritability of spine osteoarthritis is the highest in the cervical and lumbar regions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>The role of epigenetics in osteoarthritis includes more rapid phenotypic variance for cellular microenvironmental changes. For example, the MMP-13 and IL-1 beta promoter play a significant role in the maintenance of cartilage. The MMP-13 enzyme is associated with cartilage matrix destruction in osteoarthritis.&#x000a0;Demethylation of the MMP-13 promoter is associated with an increased expression of the MMP-13 protein, which, in turn, increases cartilage matrix degeneration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The most crucial associated risk factor for osteoarthritis among many studies is age.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r10">[10]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r12">[12]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;With aging, there is an alteration in the healthy joint cartilage (chondrocytes) and extracellular matrix. These alterations lead to maladaptations in both the chemical and mechanical capacity of the joint. Chondrocytes have a limited number of replications. As cells age, the telomere length lessens, leading to cellular division senescence.&#x000a0;Ultimately, this results in the inability to maintain and repair the cartilage extracellular matrix. Disruption predisposes joints to damage after sustained mechanical loads. Additionally, chondrocytes undergo apoptosis as there is a decrease in the expression of extracellular matrix macromolecules&#x000a0;as we age &#x02014; apoptosis is directly correlated with cartilage damage.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>Gender and ethnicity also have a role in osteoarthritis.&#x000a0;The degree of lumbar lordosis is different between genders. Excessive curvature increases the load on the lumbar facet joints and predisposes the lower spine to degenerative changes.&#x000a0;Changes in lumbar lordosis have a significant effect on the development of spine osteoarthritis. This change in lordosis is more pronounced in women and older men.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The contribution of ethnicity to spine osteoarthritis is mostly variable.&#x000a0;Joint mobility is more common in whites than in African Americans. Yet, there is no association between hypermobility and the development of radiographic arthritis between races. Interestingly, there is a correlation between joint hypermobility and low back pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r13">[13]</xref></p>
        <p>Diet and obesity are also directly related to the development of osteoarthritis. Risk factors for metabolic syndrome are independently associated with the development of osteoarthritis, including central obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and hyperlipidemia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r14">[14]</xref>&#x000a0;Atherosclerosis, microvascular disease, and venous stasis may also potentiate the development of osteoarthritis by worsening subchondral bone ischemia within the articular cartilage.&#x000a0; Ischemia leads to osteocyte and chondrocyte apoptosis, stiffening the subchondral bone. The lack of cartilage flexibility causes damage from mechanical loads.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r14">[14]</xref>&#x000a0;Obesity, in itself, is a condition that releases pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-alpha, and nitric oxide, and other macromolecules, including leptin, which is released from white adipose tissue and highly correlated with arthritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r10">[10]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r14">[14]</xref>&#x000a0;In fact, leptin influences growth factor synthesis and cartilage anabolism and catabolism via the regulation of STAT molecules.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;The concentration of leptin is directly proportional to the severity of cartilage destruction within tissues.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;Reactive oxygen species produced by chondrocytes can also damage the articular cartilage. Dietary intake of antioxidants, including vitamins C and K, can help prevent arthritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r10">[10]</xref></p>

        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>As patients age, the functional integrity of their spines deteriorates and predisposes patients to degenerative changes as a result of the alterations in load-bearing forces.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;This cascade begins with age-related intervertebral disc degeneration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;In a healthy spine, the facet joints carry approximately 33% of the load. However, as facet joint and intervertebral disc degeneration develop, this load-bearing increases to 70%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;As the posterior spine bears an increased load, the subchondral bone density increases along with osteophyte formation. In turn, it leads to synovial hypertrophy, cartilage necrosis, ulceration, fibrillation, eburnation, instability, and bony overgrowth. All of which can contribute to spinal stenosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>Arthritis becomes advanced due to the decline in viscoelastic properties of synovial fluid, primarily attributable to hyaluronic acid, which serves as a lubricant and shock absorber for the spine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;In addition to the decline of synovial fluid, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins produce inflammation within the facet joints. Inflammation attracts neutrophils and macrophages and produces vasodilation and venous congestion within the joint. The recurring nature of this injury will sensitize pain receptors (nociceptors); over time. Chronic pain then develops.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Additionally, inadequate blood supply leads to the pathogenesis of intervertebral disc degeneration.&#x000a0;One systematic review demonstrated that stenosis of the middle and fourth lumbar arteries is highly associated with lumbar disc degeneration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r14">[14]</xref></p>

        <p>As patients age, their cervical spines begin to go through degenerative changes. Splitting and fissuring of the vertebra and osteophyte formation occur. Aging causes calcified cartilage thickness, and the subchondral bone&#x000a0;thickness&#x000a0;at the osteocartilaginous junction changes to increase.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r15">[15]</xref>&#x000a0;In contrast, the depth of hyaline cartilage decreases with age.

        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>The typical presentation of patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the spine is&#x000a0;pain, stiffness, and motion restriction, which is commonly accompanied by referred pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;The distribution of a patient's pain depends on the location of the pathology.&#x000a0;For example, mid-cervical and lower-cervical facet joints refer pain to the posterior scapular and shoulder regions. The upper cervical complex produces pain in the occipital region and is often associated with headaches. The lumbar spine provides pain located in the buttock and thigh region. Lumbar spine osteoarthritis can be associated with radicular pain above the knee. If radicular symptoms move below the knee, nerve root compression or irritation is likely. Nerve root compression is associated with motor, sensory, and reflex deficits. The clinical exam helps&#x000a0;rule out many of the various etiologies of spinal pain, such as neoplasms, disc herniation, and spinal stenosis. However, there are no proven orthopedic examination maneuvers that are diagnostic for spine osteoarthritis.&#x000a0;Degenerative&#x000a0;osteoarthritis causes localized and unilateral pain. This pain is reproducible upon palpation of the facet joint, relieved with flexion. Radicular symptoms, if present, are limited to above the knee.&#x000a0;Pain from hyperextension and rotation from a standing position suggest facet joint arthropathy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>In many cervical spine osteoarthritis cases, patients complain of shoulder, posterior head, and anterior chest pain. If pain persists longer than one to two weeks, or there are neurological symptoms present such as numbness, tingling, loss of grip strength, or there is fever or crepitus on range of motion, patients may require&#x000a0;further evaluation.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Warning signs or red flags should also merit consideration as part of the initial evaluation of osteoarthritis of the spine. Review of systems should include numbness, loss of bowel or bladder continence, fever, chills, or the presence of saddle anesthesia.</p>
        <p>Physical exam should include inspection and palpation of the area of reported history. Furthermore, active and passive range of motion testing of the spine should also be completed. Pronounced or reduced lordosis or kyphosis should also be documented, and the patient's gait and posture should also undergo&#x000a0;assessment. Point tenderness over the spinous process requires differentiation from paraspinal muscle hypertonicity. Muscle strength, sensation, and deep tendon reflex testing are indicated depending on the location of the patient's pain. If there is a concern for myelopathy, the patient will experience upper motor neuron symptoms such as spasticity, an ataxic gait, hyperreflexia, or a positive Babinsky sign on the exam. Special tests are also necessary if radiculopathy is suspected, such as the Spurling test and straight leg raise.</p>

        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>History and physical exam are essential in the diagnosis of spine osteoarthritis. However,&#x000a0;a&#x000a0;broad differential diagnosis&#x000a0;is critical to rule out other, more threatening causes of back pain. Labs or imaging are often part of the evaluation of osteoarthritis of the spine. Less common but potentially severe etiology of back pain include infection, neoplasm, inflammatory disease, myelopathy, and aortic aneurysm or dissection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Any of these suspected etiologies of back pain require advanced imaging or testing to make the diagnosis.&#x000a0;Plain films are a standard first test in the evaluation of osteoarthritis. Plain radiographic&#x000a0;imaging is inexpensive and often easy to obtain. Current guidelines suggest plain films are an appropriate imaging modality in the absence of radicular symptoms when back pain has persisted longer than six weeks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Plain films in an acute setting&#x000a0;should be limited to patients with spinal pain suggestive of systemic disease or trauma&#x000a0;&#x02014; other more advanced imaging modalities, including MRI and CT. When there is high suspicion for a possible infection, neoplasm, or persistent and or severe neurological deficits such as severe lumbar radiculopathy, the patient requires advanced imaging.

A herniated nucleus pulposus can occur at all levels of the spine but most often occurs in the lower cervical (C5 to C6 and C6 to C7) and lumbar segments (L4 to L5 and L5 to S1).

        <p>Treatment of spine osteoarthritis includes conservative management, pharmacological interventions, and invasive procedures. The various treatment modalities get determined by the etiology of the osteoarthritis, duration of the patient's pain, neurological symptoms, and physical exam findings.&#x000a0;The American College of Physicians Clinical Guidelines Committee (ACPCGC) guideline helps direct clinicians in managing&#x000a0;low back pain. The committee's goal is to avert unnecessary costs associated with non-evidence-based management of low back pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r17">[17]</xref>&#x000a0;The ACP recommends superficial heat, massage, acupuncture, or spinal manipulation as first-line therapy for acute or subacute non-radicular low back pain. Conservative management should be the initial treatment for chronic, mechanical low back pain.&#x000a0;The classification of low back pain falls into three categories: acute, subacute, and chronic. Acute back pain lasts under four weeks, subacute four to 12 weeks, and chronic back pain longer than 12 weeks in duration.&#x000a0;Non-interventional therapies that show a small to moderate improvement of pain and function in low back pain include exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, acupuncture, massage, spinal manipulation, and low-level laser therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r17">[17]</xref></p>
        <p>One of the most beneficial traditional therapy techniques is exercise therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Specifically, land-based exercises are of the most significant benefit in increasing lumbar spine bone mineral density.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r18">[18]</xref>&#x000a0;Unfortunately, many patients with obesity have limited mobility, leading to additional weight gain and worsening of osteoarthritis symptoms. To overcome this, clinicians should create patient-specific treatment regimens. Providing supervised exercise sessions can ensure adequate exercise intensity and alleviate the fear associated with mobility.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r19">[19]</xref>&#x000a0;Clinicians should also consider aquatic exercise when appropriate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r20">[20]</xref>&#x000a0;In one meta-analysis, water-based exercise was more effective than no exercise at all in preventing age-related bone deterioration. Studies assessing swimming as part of aquatic exercise regimens often do not delineate the intensity or duration of the therapy. The best treatment for improving lumbar spine bone mineral density incorporates an intense water-based exercise regimen and moderate to vigorous intense therapy for 60 minutes, three times per week, for seven months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r18">[18]</xref></p>
        <p>Additionally, physical therapy improves patient pain and function.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Specifically, physical therapy focused on flexion-based maneuvers to address lumbar stabilization and spinal stenosis, in addition to a home-based exercise program, is a highly effective option in patients with both acute and chronic spinal pain.

        <p>Diet and nutritional supplements also play a role in managing osteoarthritis and should be combined with exercise therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r19">[19]</xref>&#x000a0;Studies suggest a higher intake of saturated fat quickens the progression of osteoarthritis. An increased intake of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat decreases the radiographic progression of osteoarthritis. Patients should reduce their consumption of omega-six fatty acids while increasing their intake of omega-three fatty acids. Omega six is associated with the development of bone marrow lesions. Patients can increase their intake of omega-three fatty acids by consuming eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Consumption of EPA and DHA reduces the pro-inflammatory burden. Evidence suggests that the use of EPA and DHA, found in oily fish, can improve pain scores in individuals with osteoarthritis. A significant benefit was found with a low dose of fish oil supplement when compared to a high dose of anti-inflammatory. There may be efficacy in prescribing a low-dose treatment of one to two capsules per day of fish oil supplements.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r19">[19]</xref></p>
        <p>Obesity is a risk factor for osteoarthritis; thus, weight management is paramount.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r19">[19]</xref>&#x000a0;For every five kilograms of weight gain, there is a 36 percent increased risk of developing osteoarthritis. Studies have demonstrated that a five percent loss in body weight can attenuate some joint pain, while a loss of at least 10 percent can produce a moderate to considerable reduction in joint pain. Joint pain in obese individuals is primarily in the load-bearing joints, including the lumbar spine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r20">[20]</xref>&#x000a0;For many obese patients, it is difficult to lose or maintain weight loss. In these patients, it is reasonable to refer to a bariatric surgeon for surgical intervention. Patients who undergo bariatric surgery via vertical banded gastroplasty reduced their body mass index (BMI) by 14.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The reduction in BMI corresponds to improvements in multiple pain and disability indexes. Other studies have demonstrated similar results. The frequency of back pain decreased in 83 percent of patients, and the severity of back pain subsided in 82 to 90 percent of patients after six to 22 months following surgery. In those with severe chronic axial back pain, the severity of pain was lessened by 44 percent after bariatric surgery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r20">[20]</xref></p>

        <p>Patients with chronic low back pain associated with osteoarthritis should be screened for depression and treated appropriately with cognitive behavioral therapy or antidepressants. Statin therapy also lowers the risk of developing osteoarthritis of the spine and prevents disease progression in patients with hyperlipidemia.

        <p>Furthermore, a herniated disc with radicular pain and mild to moderate neurological deficits for greater than four to six weeks may require surgery.

        <p>Of the five studies that compared surgical treatment versus non-surgical treatment, one study found no difference in pain at the two-year follow-up appointment. The other four studies suggested surgical treatment consistently improved pain but not walking ability over different periods, and five to 18 percent of these patients suffered from unwanted side effects post-surgery. However, the studies were of low-quality evidence, and further research is needed to make clinical recommendations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r26">[26]</xref>&#x000a0;Patients with lumbar spinal stenosis and accompanying neurogenic claudication have greater success with surgery. Surgical treatment is superior in relieving low back pain but not functional status when compared to non-surgical treatment options. Before any surgical intervention, clinicians must evaluate patients' psychosocial factors. Hysteria, hypochondriasis, depression, disability, workers' compensation, extended pre-operative sick leave, litigation, and reinforcement of pain by other family members are all predictive of poor pain tolerance and outcomes after spine surgery. Patients should stop smoking, NSAID use, and steroids before spine surgery, particularly spinal fusion surgery, as all of these factors have a significant adverse effect on fusion success rates. A detailed list of surgical options is beyond the scope of this review. However, fusion can be considered in patients with severe pain secondary to one or two levels of degenerative disease without stenosis or spondylolisthesis. It should not be an intervention when multiple levels of degenerative changes are present; intensive physical and cognitive therapy is preferred.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r24">[24]</xref></p>
        <p>Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a severe condition most commonly caused by a lumbar spine disc herniation in patients 31 to 50 years old. Most often, the disc herniation occurs between L4 and L5. Any space-occupying lesion, including spinal stenosis, cysts, infections, and tumors, can compress the cauda equina and should be on the differential diagnosis. CES is defined as having five characteristic features, including bilateral neurogenic sciatica, saddle anesthesia, bladder dysfunction, decreased anal tone, and sexual dysfunction. It is important to note that symptoms of CES can initially be subtle. Thus, a thorough history is paramount in guiding the diagnosis and treatment of this condition, which can be difficult in the setting of severe pain. However, clinical diagnosis is challenging. Even experienced clinicians have a 43 percent false-positive rate in the diagnosis of CES.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, it is essential to diagnose this condition early in its course to improve prognosis and prevent residual neurological deficits and potential litigation. The gold standard imaging for diagnosis is MRI. Urgent surgical management is required if CES is present.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r29">[29]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-38675.r30">[30]</xref></p>

        <p>Back pain is one of the most common causes of healthcare visits and costs a tremendous amount each year.&#x000a0;The etiology of back pain is far-reaching and complicated due to a long differential diagnosis. The diagnosis of osteoarthritis is difficult to correlate&#x000a0;with the origin of a patient's back pain. Therefore, it is essential to develop an interprofessional approach that reaches many levels of healthcare to provide optimal treatment for patients suffering from this condition. Primary care providers provide education and preventative strategies for patients with back pain. As the first contact with patients, they help prevent unneeded testing and invasive procedures, ultimately&#x000a0;improving patient quality of life.&#x000a0;Physical therapy and home strengthening programs prolong the potential need for future surgery in patients with chronic back pain. Orthopedic and neurological surgeons, as well as pain medicine physicians, can facilitate care when the etiology of back pain is uncertain or there is a more concerning cause for the pain, such as spinal stenosis with neurological deficits or cauda equina. Pharmacists can oversee the pharmaceutical care rendered for this type of pain, ensuring that the clinician prescribes the right agents at the correct dose and ensuring that adverse events remain in check.
