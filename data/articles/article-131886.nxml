        <p>Odontogenic cysts are frequently identified on routine examinations with head and neck imaging such as orthopantomograms and computed tomography (CT). Clinicians must obtain a complete medical history and perform a thorough head and neck exam on all patients. In evaluating odontogenic cysts, the clinical examination and interpretation of radiographic studies are essential; however, tooth vitality testing is equally important. Tooth vitality testing is required to formulate an appropriate differential diagnosis for odontogenic cysts. This step is essential in determining treatment and ultimately guides patient outcomes. This activity reviews the most common odontogenic cysts, etiologies, and appropriate therapies and highlights the role of the healthcare team in evaluating, managing, and treating patients with these entities.</p>

        <p>Odontogenic cysts are usually identified on routine exams and are generally classified as inflammatory or developmental. Radiographically, they present as unilocular or multilocular radiolucent lesions with distinct borders; however, they cannot be differentiated radiographically. In addition, odontogenic cysts may share similar radiographic appearances with aggressive odontogenic tumors (see <bold>Image.&#x000a0;</bold>Radiograph, Odontogenic Cyst in the Right Mandible).</p>

        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>A cyst is an epithelial-lined cavity. The epithelial lining of odontogenic cysts arises from the odontogenic epithelium, which includes reduced enamel epithelium (REE), the epithelial cell rest of Serres, and Malassez (ERM).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r1">[1]</xref> The REE is the epithelium that surrounds the developing crown of the tooth. The rest of the Serres are remnants of the degeneration of the dental lamina, which is responsible for initiating tooth formation during the sixth week of embryonic life. The ERM is residual cells from the disintegration of Hertwig&#x02019;s epithelial root sheath, which initiates root formation. Ultimately, these rests become entrapped within the maxillary and mandibular gingiva and the alveolar bone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>Periapical cysts are inflammatory and are the most common odontogenic cysts. They develop at the root apex of a non-vital tooth due to inflammation caused by dental caries or trauma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r3">[3]</xref> This inflammation causes the activation and proliferation of the ERM, located around the apex of the affected tooth. As a result, there is an increase in osmotic pressure, which causes cyst expansion. Frequently, the ERM is not activated, and only granulation tissue develops at the apex of the affected tooth. This granulation tissue is termed a periapical granuloma and, as such, histologically lacks an epithelial lining. Some have considered the periapical granuloma a precursor of the periapical cyst.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>Residual cysts are similar to periapical cysts as they both have an inflammatory etiology. Residual cysts result from inadequate removal of the periapical cyst at the time of extraction. Microscopically, residual cysts are identical to periapical cysts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>Paradental cysts are odontogenic cysts with an inflammatory etiology. Depending on the tooth and the location, they may be given such terms as a buccal bifurcation cyst or mandibular infected buccal cyst. These cysts occur at the crown or root of a partially or fully erupted tooth. They are located on the tooth's buccal, mesial, or distal aspects. Paradental cysts result from inflammation of the junctional epithelium within the gingival sulcus of an erupting or erupted tooth. The associated tooth frequently has a buccal enamel extension, generally the initiator of an inflammatory reaction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>Dentigerous cysts are developmental in origin. They occur when fluid accumulates between the tooth crown and enamel epithelium, dilating the follicle. Consequently, this ultimately prevents the tooth from erupting. Eruption cysts are developmental cysts considered the dentigerous cyst's soft tissue variant. A lack of separation of the dental follicle from an erupting tooth causes them.&#x000a0; Lateral periodontal cysts are developmental cysts that arise from the rest of the Serres.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Odontogenic keratocysts (OKC) have a developmental etiology and arise from the rest of the Serres.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Orthokeratinizing odontogenic cysts have a developmental etiology and arise from the rest of the Serres.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Glandular odontogenic cysts have a developmental etiology and arise from the rest of Serres or ERM.</p>

        <p>Periapical cysts are typically not seen clinically; however, they are suspected in the presence of teeth with large carious lesions or that have been traumatized. A periapical cyst is a radiographic finding. It often presents as a unilocular lesion with a well-demarcated border, measuring less than 10 mm in greatest diameter, and located at the root apex of the tooth.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r12">[12]</xref></p>
        <p>Residual cysts cannot be seen clinically and radiographically; they appear similar to a periapical cyst. However, they are associated with a previously extracted tooth.</p>
        <p>Paradental cysts occur primarily in young patients associated most commonly with an erupting or erupted first mandibular molar. They present with gingival edema, purulent discharge, and deep pockets on probing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r13">[13]</xref></p>
        <p>Dentigerous cysts are associated with the erupting or impacted tooth. There is a greater occurrence in the first and second decade of life, with the third molars and maxillary canines most affected. The cysts are asymptomatic unless they become inflamed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>Eruption cysts occur in young children or infants during deciduous or permanent teeth erupting. They present as alveolar edema with a blueish hue.</p>
        <p>Lateral periodontal cysts (LPC) may result in displacement of the roots interproximally. Unlike other odontogenic cysts, LPCs, often in the 40s and 50s, occur later in life and have a male predilection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>Odontogenic keratocysts are typically asymptomatic but may present with intra-oral edema, pain, trismus, neurosensory deficits, and infection. They are difficult to appreciate clinically because they expand anteriorly-posteriorly within the alveolar bone.

<bold>Periapical Cyst&#x000a0;</bold>
</p>
        <p>Periapical cysts are inflammatory cysts. Clinically, the involved tooth is non-vital due to either a history of extensive dental caries and/or trauma. Radiographically, periapical cysts present as an unilocular radiolucency at the apex of the tooth, demonstrating well-defined borders that may be corticated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r12">[12]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Residual Cyst</bold>
</p>
        <p>Clinically, the patient is partially edentulous, as the offending tooth was previously extracted. Residual cysts are similar in radiographic appearance to periapical cysts but are not associated with a tooth. Consequently, it is essential to inquire about the patient's dental history.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Paradental Cyst&#x000a0;</bold>
</p>
        <p>Detailed clinical and radiographic evaluations are critical in identifying these cysts. They are often associated with an erupted mandibular first molar or partially impacted third molar. Clinically, erythema, edema of the marginal gingival tissue, prudence discharge, and a deep probing depth are noted. The patient may have a history of pericoronitis. Radiographically, they present as a pericoronal, well-demarcated unilocular radiolucency at the tooth's buccal, mesial, or distal aspects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r13">[13]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Dentigerous Cyst</bold>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Dentigerous cysts are commonly associated with an impacted tooth (eruption delayed or partially erupted). It is essential to obtain radiographs to evaluate. Clinically, a dentigerous cyst is asymptomatic unless it is inflamed. Radiographically, dentigerous cysts appear as well-demarcated, unilocular radiolucency located at the cementoenamel junction of the tooth. They may appear radiographically similar to an OKC or ameloblastoma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r2">[2]</xref> It has been theorized that radiolucencies exceeding 4 mm indicate more aggressive behavior in which tooth displacement can occur.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Eruption Cyst</bold>
</p>
        <p>Eruption cysts are diagnosed clinically; however, they should be confirmed with radiographic imaging. The examination determines whether the cyst causing the delayed eruption is associated with a deciduous or permanent tooth. The overlying gingival tissue has edema, a bluish hue, and/or a translucent appearance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r8">[8]</xref> Eruption cysts are the gingival counterpart of the LPC.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Lateral Periodontal Cyst (LPC)</bold>
</p>
        <p>Clinically, involved teeth are vital and may appear displaced or demonstrate associated mobility. They may also present with alveolar expansion&#x02014;buccally or lingually. The interproximal gingival mass is immovable and firm, without erythema or signs of infection. Similar to other odontogenic cysts, LPCs are usually painless and are incidental to radiographic findings. Radiographically, they are a well-demarcated unilocular radiolucency located interproximally between&#x000a0;2 adjacent roots. A variant of LPC, the botryoid (grape-like) odontogenic cyst, presents in the same location; however, it appears as a multilocular/multicystic radiolucency.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r6">[6]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Odontogenic Keratocyst&#x000a0;</bold>
</p>
        <p>Approximately 25 to 40% of odontogenic keratocysts are associated with an impacted tooth.[10]. Clinically, the patient may have delayed tooth eruption, and thus, it is important to obtain diagnostic radiographs to evaluate. OKCs are frequently asymptomatic as they expand in an anterior-posterior direction with little buccolingual expansion. Larger OKCs may present with pain, intraoral edema, trismus, sensory deficits, infection, and drainage. Radiographically, OKCs have varied presentations ranging from a well-demarcated unilocular lesion with smooth borders to a unilocular lesion with a scalloped border to a multilocular radiolucency.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r2">[2]</xref> Patients presenting with multiple OKC lesions should be evaluated for or referred to evaluate for nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (Gorlin syndrome). Gorlin syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited condition resulting from mutations in the PTCH tumor suppressor gene mapped to chromosome 9q22. The syndrome is significant for multiple basal cell carcinomas, palmar pits, multiple OKCs, and bilamellar calcification of the falx cerebri. Genetic testing of the patient and close family members is required to diagnose Gorlin syndrome officially.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r2">[2]</xref></p>

<bold>Orthokeratinizing Odontogenic Cyst</bold>
</p>
        <p>Orthokeratinizing odontogenic cysts should&#x000a0;not be mistaken for a variant of OKC. It is commonly associated with an impacted tooth; thus, a patient may experience delayed tooth eruption clinically. It is important to obtain radiographs to evaluate impacted teeth. Radiographically, ortho-keratinizing odontogenic cysts present as a well-demarcated unilocular radiolucency usually seen in the posterior mandible region.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Glandular Odontogenic Cyst</bold>
</p>
        <p>Clinically, erupted teeth associated with glandular odontogenic cysts are often associated with mobility or displacement. There may also be swelling, alveolar expansion, pain, or neurosensory deficit. Radiographically, GOCs may present as unilocular or multilocular radiolucency with well-demarcated borders crossing the midline. They are aggressive, usually resulting in root displacement and resorption.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r9">[9]</xref></p>

        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>Periapical cysts are commonly treated with non-surgical endodontic (root canal) therapy. Surgical endodontic therapy or extraction is required if the tooth remains symptomatic after endodontic therapy. Surgical endodontic therapy, apicoectomy (removing the root apex), and curettage of the cyst produce reliable bone healing. Extraction with curettage or enucleation of the socket is also effective at eliminating the occurrence of a residual cyst. Overall, surgical endodontic therapy results in 95% bone healing compared to 66% with non-surgical treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131886.r15">[15]</xref></p>

        <p>Orthokeratinizing odontogenic cysts are developmental in origin. Patients should be made aware of these lesions and plan to have them excised. Conservative management and subsequent removal of these lesions normally result in permanent resolution.</p>
        <p>Glandular odontogenic cysts are developmental in origin. Patients should be informed of these lesions and counseled on the general statistics and outcomes. Treatment options must be thoroughly discussed, and the patient is allowed to ask questions. However, due to their high recurrence, close clinical and radiographic follow-up is required.</p>

        <p>Odontogenic cysts can be inflammatory or developmental. Good oral hygiene and routine dental care can reduce the likelihood of inflammatory odontogenic cysts. In addition, routine clinical and radiographic examinations can aid in detecting asymptomatic inflammatory and developmental odontogenic cysts.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Treatment of these lesions can range from monitoring to surgical treatment. Lesions that have rapid growth are fixed and/or appear atypical should be referred immediately to the appropriate healthcare specialist for evaluation, biopsy, diagnosis, and management.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Most members of the healthcare team encounter odontogenic cysts in their practice. The majority of the cysts are developmental and possess low malignant potential. Routine and preventive dental care can reduce extensive treatment and result in more favorable outcomes.</p>
