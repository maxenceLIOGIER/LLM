        <p>Idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage is a rare condition caused by bleeding into the lower respiratory tract, usually the alveoli. Its classical presentation is a clinical triad of hemoptysis, iron-deficiency anemia, and pulmonary infiltrates on chest imaging in the absence of any other identifiable cause of pulmonary or systemic hemorrhage. Early diagnosis leads to prompt treatment and a reduction in mortality and complications. This activity describes the clinical course of the disease and discusses the evaluation and management of patients presenting with idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage is a rare condition that affects the lower respiratory tract. It can be divided into two clinical entities depending on whether the pathophysiology and presentation are acute or chronic. Acute idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage usually presents as diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), while the more insidious or chronic pulmonary hemorrhage often presents as idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH) following repeated alveolar bleeding. The terms idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage, idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage are often used interchangeably.&#x000a0;Historically, idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage was first described by Virchow in 1864 as "brown lung induration."<italic toggle="yes">&#x000a0;</italic>Ceelen in 1931 gave a more detailed description of the condition after autopsies revealed large amounts of hemosiderin in 2 children, while Waldenstrom, in 1944, made the first&#x000a0;antemortem diagnosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23348.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Pulmonary hemorrhage is the extravasation of blood into the alveoli, that is, bleeding into the lower respiratory tract. It can be severe and life-threatening.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23348.r1">[1]</xref> In diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, the bleeding is usually of sudden onset and is widespread and not limited to a section of the lungs. In idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, repeated alveolar hemorrhage causes the accumulation of hemosiderin, a by-product of hemoglobin breakdown, in the alveoli. Alveolar macrophages take up these hemosiderin molecules, usually within 36 to 72 hours, and can remain in the lungs for up to 8 weeks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23348.r1">[1]</xref> Acute idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage in infants (AIPHI) is a rare, quite distinct clinical presentation of the condition that occurs in infants and is characterized by the sudden onset of pulmonary bleeding in a previously healthy infant in the absence of other known co-morbidities including prematurity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23348.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;The clinical spectrum of IPH ranges from asymptomatic cases to life-threatening acute respiratory failure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23348.r3">[3]</xref> AIPHI often presents acutely with severe respiratory distress.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23348.r2">[2]</xref> Due to its rarity and varied presentations, IPH often causes a diagnostic pitfall for many clinicians. Unfortunately, delayed diagnosis leads to delayed treatment and, ultimately, a poor outcome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23348.r4">[4]</xref></p>

        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>As the name implies, there is no known cause for IPH, and it is a diagnosis of exclusion. A diagnosis of IPH can only be made after thorough investigations have ruled out other known causes of pulmonary hemorrhages, such as vasculitis and bleeding disorders (eg, von Willebrand disease). Other causes of systemic or visceral hemorrhages, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, should also be excluded. However, possible triggers in at-risk children include lower respiratory tract infections, celiac disease, and cow's milk protein allergy, although the evidence for these is not very strong, perhaps due to the rarity of the condition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23348.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23348.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23348.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;A possible association with Down's syndrome has been reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23348.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;Similarly, an association with the fungi, <italic toggle="yes">Stachybotrys chartarum</italic>, was reported but has now been refuted. There is no substantial evidence linking it to tobacco smoking or any other known environmental factors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23348.r6">[6]</xref></p>

This attracts more pro-inflammatory cytokines and causes chronic inflammation and thickening of the alveolar basement membrane. Ultimately this causes interstitial lung fibrosis with a restrictive picture on spirometry.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23348.r4">[4]</xref> In infants, the disease is poorly understood.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23348.r2">[2]</xref></p>

        <p>The clinical features of idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage depend on whether it is acute or chronic.

Anemia and dyspnea are the most frequent presentations. The classical triad often described in medical texts of hemoptysis, iron-deficiency anemia, and diffuse parenchymal shadowing on chest imaging is not seen frequently in children.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23348.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23348.r7">[7]</xref> Some children may present with weight loss and failure to thrive.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23348.r1">[1]</xref> In severe cases, hypoxemic (type 1) respiratory failure may be seen, especially in infants.

        <p>In some cases of IPH, iron deficiency anemia precedes other symptoms by many months.

In the acute phase, the physical examination may be completely normal or include respiratory signs such as tachypnea. In the chronic phase, there may be pallor, failure to thrive, weight loss, or hepatosplenomegaly. It may also be unremarkable.

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>Idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage, though primarily a respiratory condition, involves an&#x000a0;interprofessional team approach in its diagnosis and management, especially as it is a diagnosis made after the exclusion of a long list of other differential diagnoses. Many patients with IPH may initially present to their primary care clinicians with symptoms of anemia. Though not a primary differential of anemia, IPH should be suspected in those with iron-deficiency anemia who do not respond to iron supplementation. Primary care clinicians should be mindful of this and liaise early with&#x000a0;pulmonologists&#x000a0;for further investigations. The gastroenterologist should also be involved to exclude a gastro-intestinal source of bleeding. The rheumatologist's opinion should be sought to eliminate autoimmune diseases such as vasculitides as a possible cause for IPH. The endocrinologist may also be involved during long-term treatment with corticosteroids. The intensivists may be engaged during a hyper-acute presentation with respiratory failure. The nursing needs of the patient, especially during the acute stage, are high, and these patients may require individualized care tailored to meet their care needs. Chest physiotherapy may be needed in the immediate recovery stage and in those who develop pulmonary fibrosis as a complication. Patients with recurrence of symptoms or complications of long-term steroid use may require a prolonged follow-up period spanning years. Channels of communication should be kept open to facilitate a seamless and efficient exchange of information between the different members of the&#x000a0;interprofessional team caring for these patients. Referrals should be made early to improve outcomes.</p>
