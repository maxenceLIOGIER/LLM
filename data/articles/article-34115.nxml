        <p>Dental caries occur when the demineralization of the enamel exceeds its demineralization capacity. Dental caries is a dynamic process that involves susceptible tooth surfaces, cariogenic bacteria, mainly Streptococcus mutans, and a fermentable carbohydrate source. Sucrose is the most common dietary sugar and is considered the most cariogenic carbohydrate. Frequent consumption of carbohydrates in the form of simple sugars increases the risk of dental caries. This article discusses the role of sugar in developing dental caries, provides concise dietary guidelines for expecting mothers, children, and adults, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in preventing dental caries through dietary education.</p>

<bold>The Role Of Sugar In Dental Caries</bold>
</p>
        <p>Dental caries occur&#x000a0;when the&#x000a0;demineralization of the enamel exceeds its demineralization capacity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r4">[4]</xref> Bacteria in the dental plaque metabolize fermentable carbohydrates from the diet, particularly sucrose. As a result of this process, organic acids are produced, causing a drop in the pH. It has been hypothesized that when the pH is lower than 5.5, demineralization of the enamel occurs, known as the critical pH. This process occurs every time fermentable carbohydrates are consumed. Caries development necessitates sugar to occur;&#x000a0;health care professionals should be well informed regarding dietary strategies to prevent this disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Classification of Sugars</bold>
</p>
        <p>The sugars most commonly found in an average diet are sucrose, glucose, fructose, lactose, and maltose, from which some regard sucrose as the most cariogenic.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r5">[5]</xref> When assessing a patient&#x02019;s diet, it is essential to differentiate between natural and added sugars.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Natural sugars are those intrinsically found in the structure of fresh fruits and vegetables, milk, and dairy products.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;Natural sugars do not play a significant role&#x000a0;in developing dental caries and other non-communicable diseases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;This is probably due to their protective components&#x000a0;(polyphenolic compounds, calcium, water, and fiber) and&#x000a0;the hardness of some fruits and vegetables, which stimulates saliva production.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;Furthermore, cow&#x02019;s milk is classed as non-cariogenic.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r5">[5]</xref> It may even protect teeth from dental caries thanks to its high calcium and casein content.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>Added sugars, also called free sugars by the WHO, are the sugars added to foods and drinks by manufacturers or cooks and sugars present in edible products other than fresh fruit, vegetables, milk, and grains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r7">[7]</xref>, e.g., fruit juices, honey, and syrups.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r8">[8]</xref> Excessive intake of added sugars is closely linked to an extensive list of systemic conditions, including dental caries, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Starchy Food</bold>
</p>
        <p>Dietary starches refer to a variety of food rich in starch (a polymeric carbohydrate), including bread, pasta, potatoes, potato products, rice, oats, breakfast cereals, and other grains. Dietary starches are of low cariogenicity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r5">[5]</xref> Experiments in animals have demonstrated that raw starch has a low cariogenic potential; however, cooked starch is between a third and a half as cariogenic as sucrose.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;Furthermore, combining sucrose and starch is possibly more cariogenic than sugar.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>The Adhesiveness of Sugar</bold>
</p>
        <p>The adhesiveness of food is directly related to its cariogenic potential.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;If the form of sugar has a great tendency to adhere to dental surfaces, the risk of caries increases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;However, the cariogenic potential of foodstuff with low stickiness, like drinks high in sugar, should not be underestimated as they significantly increase the risk of dental caries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>The Amount and Frequency of Sugar Consumed</bold>
</p>
        <p>It is well established that sugar consumption positively correlates with the development of dental caries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r4">[4]</xref> Enamel is demineralized every time sugar is consumed, defined as a demineralization attack, and the demineralization increases with the frequency of such episodes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;Moreover, the amount of sugar consumed also influences the severity of dental caries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r5">[5]</xref> However, it is hard to establish if the amount of sugar intake is more important than the frequency or vice versa, as these two variables are hard to analyze separately.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>Several studies evaluate the association between the amount and frequency of sugar intake and dental caries. For example, one study found that 3-year-old children that ingested sugars four to five times per day were six times more likely to have a high caries rate than children with the lowest frequency of sugar intake.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;The effects of sugar intake on caries activity were studied in 436 patients from a mental health facility over five years.&#x000a0;Among other discoveries, they concluded that if sugar was consumed with meals no more than four times per day, it had a low impact on caries development.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r10">[10]</xref> By contrast, increased sugar consumption between meals was linked to high caries activity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r10">[10]</xref></p>
        <p>The &#x0201c;sugar-caries relationship&#x0201d; also depends on oral hygiene, fluoride exposure, and socio-economic status.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Types of Sweeteners</bold>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Sugar substitutes pose numerous benefits for preventing and controlling mainly diabetes mellitus, weight, and dental caries. This article will discuss the most important features of sugar substitutes concerning oral health. Of course, sugar substitutes need to be safe for consumption; they must be non-toxic, non-oncogenic, and nutritionally appropriate for the specific drink or food.</p>
        <p>Sweeteners&#x000a0;are substances that provide sweetness to food and drinks and are classified into two main types according to their caloric potential: caloric (carbohydrate-based) and non-caloric (non-carbohydrate based).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r11">[11]</xref></p>

<bold>Sucrose</bold>
</p>
        <p>Sucrose is the most common dietary sugar.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;It is obtained from sugar cane and beets and is also present in fruits.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Past and modern studies have demonstrated a distinctive cariogenic potential of each type of dietary sugar; among these, sucrose is the most cariogenic.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r2">[2]</xref> However, why sucrose is linked to more severe dental caries is still under investigation. Recent studies have found that the cariogenic potential of sugars could be positively correlated with their capacity to regulate the oral ecosystem.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r2">[2]</xref> Sucrose may induce a microbial imbalance that favors caries development more than other sugar.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Sugar Alcohols</bold>
</p>
        <p>Sugar alcohols result from reducing the carbonyl group of sugars.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r11">[11]</xref> They are non-fermentable and heat resistant.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r11">[11]</xref> They do not induce insulin secretion, trigger a rapid glucose rise in the blood, or increase lipoprotein-lipase activity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;They are suitable sweeteners for patients with diabetes mellitus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r11">[11]</xref></p>
        <p>They are not fermented or only a little by oral microorganisms; therefore, they are non-cariogenic.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;Sugar alcohols may even promote remineralization of the enamel.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r11">[11]</xref></p>
        <p>All sugar alcohols, except erythritol, have been associated with unpleasant adverse effects, including abdominal discomfort and flatulence, and when taken in excess, they may induce diarrhea.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;They leave a cooling sensation in the mouth.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r11">[11]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Xylitol</bold>
</p>
        <p>Xylitol is a non-cariogenic and antibacterial sugar alcohol.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;It has a similar sweetness to sugar and a pleasant taste, but like other sugar alcohols, it leaves a cooling sensation in the mouth.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;It is added to various products for caries prevention, including chewing gum, chewable tablets, lozenges, mouthwashes, toothpaste, and cough mixtures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>Xylitol is believed to have an antimicrobial action on the biofilm. Studies have demonstrated that it impairs plaque formation and the adherence of bacteria.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Since it reduces bacterial acid production, it inhibits the demineralization of the enamel.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Regular consumption of xylitol by the mother has been found to reduce the horizontal transmission of cariogenic bacteria to the infant.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Furthermore, xylitol increases salivary flow and decreases the development of cariogenic bacteria.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r1">[1]</xref></p>

        <title>Issues of Concern</title>
        <p>Understanding how diet and eating behaviors contribute to caries rates in children and adults is essential to improving oral health. Dental caries is a multifactorial disease. Dietary sugars are the substrate for cariogenic bacteria to flourish and generate enamel-demineralizing acids. There is a strong correlation between the amount and the frequency of free sugar intake and dental caries. Refined foods and fermentable carbohydrates increase the risk of dental disease. By contrast, starchy staple food and fresh fruits have been shown to be associated with low levels of caries activity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r4">[4]</xref></p>

<bold>Dietary Recommendations To Prevent Dental Caries</bold>
</p>
        <p>When a population consumes less than 15 to 20 kg/person/year of free sugars, the levels of dental caries remain low.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;This is the maximum safe level of free sugar intake for caries prevention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;The frequency of sugar intake per day should be limited to four times or less daily as higher frequency usually exceeds 15 kg/year and is linked to higher levels of caries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>Food that stimulates saliva secretion has a protective effect against caries, e.g., hard cheeses, peanuts, wholegrain foods, and sugar-free chewing gum.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>A diet rich in fresh vegetables, fruits, and wholegrain starches and low in added sugars and fat prevents chronic diseases associated with diet, including oral conditions like dental caries, periodontal infections, and oral malignancy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>The Prenatal Stage</bold>
</p>
        <p>Mothers and caregivers influence their children's diet and oral hygiene. Pregnant women have a unique opportunity to receive appropriate information about healthy dietary habits and general oral hygiene to prevent early childhood caries in their children.

        <p>The first few years after birth are critical since there is a massive dietary shift from exclusive milk and liquid diet to a modified adult diet. Breastfeeding is strongly recommended in the first year of life because of its nutritional and immunological benefits. Breast milk is insignificant in the development of early childhood caries as compared to night-time bottle feeding, which should be discouraged. Breast milk is low in fluoride.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r13">[13]</xref>&#x000a0;Systemic fluoride supplementation can be indicated for infants more than six months of age if the fluoride levels are insufficient in the area where they live.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;However, clinicians must corroborate that the fluoride levels are low in the local drinking water before supplementing a child because of the risk of dental fluorosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r12">[12]</xref></p>

        <p>Malnutrition, especially in children, results from improper dietary behaviors and feeding practices in infancy and childhood. It is usually related to limited access to fresh and nutritious food, which is replaced with low-cost and high in sugars food.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Poor nutrition, especially during the early years of development, increases the risk of dental and periodontal disease.</p>
        <p>Besides dental caries, nutrition may contribute to developing other dental and oral mucosa pathologies.&#x000a0;Delayed tooth eruption and salivary gland dysfunction may be linked to protein deficiencies. Vitamin A deficiency leads to impaired epithelial tissue development, tooth formation, and enamel hypoplasia. Vitamin D and calcium deficiency cause hypo-mineralization, delayed eruption, the absence of lamina dura, and abnormal alveolar bone patterns.</p>
        <p>Delayed wound healing, dentin malformations, bleeding gums, and defective collagen formation may result from vitamin C deficiency. Angular cheilosis and periodontal diseases are associated with a lack of vitamin B.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r15">[15]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r16">[16]</xref></p>

        <p>The incidence of dental caries has increased significantly over the past few decades. Part of the reason is the excess intake of added sugars. Dental caries is associated with increased morbidity: dental pain, infection, and cosmetic disfigurement, ultimately leading to premature loss of teeth. Nutrition is a modifiable parameter that plays a crucial role in preventing dental caries, as sugar is required for the disease to occur.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>The risk of caries increases with more frequent and higher free sugar intake and consumption of food, with a tendency to be retained in the oral tissues for longer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r10">[10]</xref> Free sugar intake between meals is also associated with higher caries rates.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34115.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0; An interdisciplinary team of dentists, general practitioners, nurses, and dieticians must work together to ensure patients are well informed of the connection between proper nutrition and oral health and receive dietary advice to prevent dental caries and other systemic conditions related to poor nutrition. Healthcare professionals must also perform basic nutrition screening and assess patients' diets. Furthermore, dental hygienists can also provide dietary advice along with oral hygiene instructions. Collaboration between all these health care providers will greatly improve patients' outcomes.</p>
