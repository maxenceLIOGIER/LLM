        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Lidocaine is a local anesthetic drug that produces transient loss of sensory, motor, and autonomic function when the drug is injected or applied in proximity to neural tissue. It is the most common local anesthetic used in almost all medical specialties.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30395.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30395.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;It also is commonly used as an antiarrhythmic agent to depress ventricular arrhythmias. Infusions of lidocaine (and procaine) have been used to supplement general anesthetic techniques, as they are capable of reducing the minimum alveolar concentration of volatile anesthetics by up to 40%, as well as providing pain relief in the peri-operative phase. It is in the class of the local amide anesthetics, which, compared to the ester-type local anesthetics, is usually well tolerated with&#x000a0;only&#x000a0;rare occasions of allergic reactions. Amide local anesthetics are metabolized (N-dealkylation and hydroxylation) by microsomal P-450 enzymes in the liver.</p>
        <p>Applied either by injection, inhalation or as a topical agent to provide anesthesia, lidocaine&#x000a0;has a good safety margin before reaching toxic blood levels. Since it can be applied in various forms to the same patients, care must be taken to keep track of the total dose given to minimize its systemic toxicity. In addition,&#x000a0;clinicians should consider the dose of any other local anesthetics that may have been administered to the same patient, as toxic doses appear to be additive. Lidocaine toxicity is not only determined by the total dose (usually 4.5 mg/kg) but also by the rate of absorption, which is dependent on the blood flow of that tissue. To reduce blood flow to the injection site and the absorption rate, vasoconstrictors such as epinephrine 1:200000 are frequently used and may increase the toxic dose to 7 mg/kg.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30395.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30395.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>Lidocaine toxicity&#x000a0;to muscles and peripheral or neuraxial nerves&#x000a0;can occur locally at the site of injection.&#x000a0;Transient neurologic symptoms (TNS) after high-concentration lidocaine spinal anesthetics have been described multiple times and have led to either reducing the concentration of the dose or switching to a different agent.</p>
        <p>In addition to direct nerve toxicity, systemic toxicity affecting the brain or cardiac muscle can lead to sudden and dramatic changes in the patient&#x02019;s vital signs. Finally, there are the side effects of a relative overdose at the site of injection, which can be quite dramatic. Examples include total spinal anesthesia or subdural injection of the drug that can cause severe hemodynamic compromise such as hypotension or bradycardia up to a cardiac and respiratory arrest.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-30395.s3" sec-type="Etiology">
        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>Toxicity to local nerves and muscles is thought to be a consequence of the prolonged application of high drug concentrations, the effect of preservatives in the local anesthetic solution, or both.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30395.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30395.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;Systemic local anesthetic toxicity is due to high systemic plasma levels of lidocaine due to the absorption of large doses of lidocaine, which depends mostly on the blood flow at the site of injection: tracheal &#x0003e; intercostal &#x0003e; caudal &#x0003e; paracervical &#x0003e; epidural &#x0003e; brachial plexus &#x0003e; subcutaneous. Also, blind injection of large volumes into a large muscular area, such as for lumbar plexus block or sciatic nerve blocks, can lead to systemic lidocaine toxicity. Spinal anesthetics are very low in total volume and do not cause systemic lidocaine toxicity. Inadvertent intra-arterial injections may cause local anesthetic toxicity in the tissue beds supplied by that artery, even in doses below the systemic toxic concentration. This complication is seen primarily with&#x000a0;injections into the neck, causing central nervous system (CNS) symptoms often during the injection or shortly thereafter without progressing to cardiac toxicity.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-30395.s4" sec-type="Epidemiology">
        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>All sexes are affected equally by lidocaine toxicity. Patients who are likely to be more susceptible to local anesthetic toxicity are patients at the extremes of age and women who are&#x000a0;pregnant. Rates of severe systemic toxicity (seizures with or without cardiac arrest) occur on the order of 1:10,000 for epidurals and up to 1:2000 for peripheral nerve blocks, depending on the type of block. Patients under sedation are at increased risk.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-30395.s5" sec-type="Pathophysiology">
        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>Most local anesthetics block voltage-gated sodium channels inside the cell, preventing subsequent channel activation and interfering with membrane depolarization's large transient sodium influx. Impulse conduction slows, the rate of rising and the magnitude of the action potential decrease, and the threshold for excitation is raised progressively until an action potential can no longer be generated and impulse propagation is abolished. Hence, the pronounced effect of lidocaine toxicity on cells relies on the propagation of action potentials such as the central nervous and the myocardial conduction systems. Local anesthetics&#x000a0;also&#x000a0;may block calcium and potassium channels and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors to varying degrees.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-30395.s6" sec-type="Histopathology">
        <title>Histopathology</title>
        <p>All local anesthetics can cause direct neurotoxicity, depending on the dose and time of contact with the nerve. The occurrence of clinically relevant myopathy and myonecrosis has been described after continuous peripheral blocks, infiltration of wound margins, trigger point injections, and peri- and retrobulbar blocks. Histologically, myofibril hypercontraction progresses to lytic degeneration, edema, and necrosis. Regeneration usually occurs after&#x000a0;3 to&#x000a0;4 weeks. Concomitant steroid or epinephrine injections can worsen myonecrosis.</p>

      <sec id="article-30395.s7" sec-type="Toxicokinetics">
        <title>Toxicokinetics</title>
        <p>Potency correlates with lipid solubility, which is the ability of the local anesthetic molecule to penetrate membranes in a hydrophobic environment.</p>
        <p>The duration of action&#x000a0;also&#x000a0;correlates&#x000a0;with lipid solubility and protein binding. Highly lipid-soluble and protein-bound local anesthetics have a longer duration of action, presumably because they are less likely to be cleared by blood flow. Local anesthetics that are highly lipid-soluble also exhibit a high degree of plasma protein binding, mostly to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein and, to a lesser extent, albumin; consequently, their elimination is prolonged. Blood flow to the tissue deposit of local anesthetic determines the absorption rate and is responsible for the plasma level. It will, however, also transport local anesthetics away from the tissue site, reducing the risk of direct nerve toxicity. Lidocaine has a 90% hepatic metabolism, and the elimination half-life is 1.5 to 2 hours, which can be prolonged up to 3.5 fold in patients with severe liver disease.</p>

        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>The&#x000a0;CNS is the site of premonitory signs of overdose in awake patients. Early symptoms are circumoral numbness, tongue paresthesia, and dizziness. Sensory complaints may include tinnitus and blurred vision. Excitatory signs, such as restlessness, agitation, nervousness, or paranoia,&#x000a0;may progress to muscle twitches and seizures. Ultimately, with large overdoses, CNS depression, including unconsciousness and coma, can occur. Hypotension and bradycardia can also be side effects of relative local anesthetic overdoses that sometimes occur during neuraxial blockade or nerve blocks performed near the CNS.</p>
        <p>Major cardiovascular toxicity usually requires a higher lactic acid (LA) concentration in blood than that which produces seizures. Unintentional intravascular injection of local anesthetics during regional anesthesia produces severe cardiotoxic reactions, including hypotension, atrioventricular heart block, idioventricular rhythms, and life-threatening arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation and are usually the presenting signs of local anesthetic toxicity during general anesthesia.</p>

      <sec id="article-30395.s9" sec-type="Evaluation">
        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>The diagnosis is made clinically. The timing, dose, and site of the lidocaine injection are the main factors in considering systemic manifestations. It is important to keep in mind that even low doses injected inadvertently into an artery going to the brain can cause&#x000a0;CNS symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30395.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30395.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30395.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <p>For direct local manifestations, such as pain seen in TNS, the concentration, and the injection site will help make the diagnosis. While imaging the spine with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will not help diagnose TNS. However, it will help to rule out other causes that may compress the structures within the spinal canal, which could also cause severe pain after neuraxial blockade and would require urgent surgical decompression. A lidocaine plasma level can be obtained, but it will take too long for the results to be meaningful for any treatment decisions.</p>

        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>Treatment of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) is symptomatic by raising the seizure threshold through pharmacologic interventions such as administering benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or propofol. Hyperventilation with high doses of oxygen reduces cerebral blood flow.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30395.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30395.r10">[10]</xref></p>
        <p>The other mainstay of treatment is reducing the free available local anesthetic concentration in the plasma by administering lipid emulsions. Due to the high lipid solubility, the infusion of&#x000a0;lipid emulsions will bind free circulating local anesthetics and lower the plasma levels.

        <p>The timing of the onset of symptoms related to the injection or application of large doses of lidocaine will most likely make the diagnosis. However, coincidental seizures due to a seizure disorder or panic attacks with hyperventilation may confound the diagnosis.</p>
        <p>For direct local toxicity symptoms after lidocaine injection, such as radicular pain, first exclude other causes,&#x000a0;such as hematoma,&#x000a0;that may compress structures in the spinal canal and require urgent surgical decompression.

        <p>Lidocaine is used by many healthcare professionals, including physicians, certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. Practitioners using this anesthetic must know its potential toxicity and how to manage it. Because lidocaine can cause seizures and arrhythmias, poison control should be contacted. A toxicologist, a neurologist, and a cardiologist should be consulted immediately. At the same time, the airway should be managed and maintained patent. The other mainstay of treatment is reducing the free available local anesthetic concentration in the plasma by administering lipid emulsions. Due to the high lipid solubility, infusion of&#x000a0;lipid emulsions will bind free circulating local anesthetics and lower the plasma levels.&#x000a0;The outcomes of patients with lidocaine toxicity depend on the dose and presence of neurological symptoms.
