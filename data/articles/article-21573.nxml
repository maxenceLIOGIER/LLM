        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Factitious disorder imposed on self - Munchausen syndrome - is a syndrome in which patients consciously induce, feign, or exaggerate physical or psychiatric symptoms for primary gain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21573.r1">[1]</xref> These patients are motivated purely by internal gains, such as seeking attention, coping with stress, or enjoyment in stumping healthcare workers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21573.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21573.r3">[3]</xref> Patients with factitious disorders can pose a significant danger to themselves by undergoing a plethora of unnecessary procedures or in the induction of symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21573.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21573.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;Additionally, they often over-utilize limited healthcare resources.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21573.r5">[5]</xref> The inherent deception in this condition poses a significant challenge for healthcare providers when diagnosing. Due to a lack of willing participants for large-scale randomized treatment trials, evidence-based recommendations for managing these patients are limited. Current recommendations are based on expert opinion, case reports, and systematic reviews. Based on information from these sources, treatment options are limited, and the prognosis for these patients is generally poor.</p>

        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>The etiology of factitious disorder is largely based on speculation. No high-quality, large-scale studies demonstrate consistent etiological factors; however, observations have been made based on case reports and small studies. Many experts consider factitious disorder to be largely developmental. The behaviors exhibited are thought to be maladaptive responses to life events, especially during childhood.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21573.r3">[3]</xref> This reasoning is supported by several commonalities among patients with factitious disorder:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Patients with factitious disorders are more likely to have suffered a major childhood illness. It appears that for some patients, this early experience with the healthcare system is pivotal in the development of this disorder. One review of 20 cases reported that 60% of patients had a history of significant childhood illness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21573.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Most experts agree that patients with factitious disorders are much more likely to have suffered from a difficult or traumatic childhood.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21573.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;A study that reviewed dialogue obtained from online support groups for factitious disorder found that out of 57 members, only&#x000a0;3 described having a good childhood. In contrast, the majority described various forms of emotional and physical abuse.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21573.r8">[8]</xref></p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>There is a strong association among patients with personality disorders and factitious disorders, and many overlapping behavioral traits are evident, further supporting the developmental theory.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21573.r7">[7]</xref></p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>There are several proposed mechanisms behind the behavior found in factitious disorder:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>

        <p>Some experts have described factitious disorder as a type of behavioral addiction.

        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>The prevalence of factitious disorder in the general population is difficult to estimate and varies widely among different studies. Due to the secretive nature of this disorder, it is likely underdiagnosed; further, there is no defined threshold for the level of deception required to make a diagnosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21573.r3">[3]</xref> One study involving 241 German physicians in primary care and various subspecialty fields estimated factitious disorder prevalence at 1.3%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21573.r10">[10]</xref> Another study analyzing 100 consecutive admissions to an inpatient psychiatric ward in New York found a diagnosis of factitious disorder in 6% of the study population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21573.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;Factors that have been ascertained to increase the diathesis of this disease include female sex, employment in the healthcare field, and being unmarried.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21573.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;Most often, factitious disorder onsets in early adulthood or middle age.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21573.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>

        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>Little is known about the pathophysiology of factitious disorder. One study of&#x000a0;5 individuals with a diagnosis of factitious disorder found that all had excellent intellectual and verbal skills, but neuropsychological testing revealed deficits in conceptual organization and judgment. Based on this, the authors hypothesized that factitious disorder may be related to certain patients' dysfunction in the right cerebral hemisphere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21573.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;Numerous isolated case reports exist documenting neuroimaging and other findings in patients with factitious disorders.

        <p>Patients with factitious disorder may present to any specialty with self-induced, feigned, or exaggerated symptoms.

        </list>
        <p>If factitious disorder is suspected, evaluation should be geared toward providing objective evidence of deception and falsification of a medical or psychiatric condition. Many findings from the evaluation could help lead to a diagnosis. These include:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Absence of supporting lab work, imaging, or other diagnostic findings for the presumed disease.</p>

          <list-item>
            <p>Specific labwork proving the falsification of symptoms. For example, in patients with factitious diarrhea, a stool sample may be positive for laxatives, or stool osmolality may be consistent with water. In non-diabetic hypoglycemia, testing may be done to rule out exogenous insulin use.</p>

            <p>A search of the patient&#x02019;s room reveals a means of inducing symptoms. (eg, syringes, laxatives, blood pressure medications, sedatives, illicit drugs) This is often part of the consent form signed by a patient upon admission.</p>

        <p>In certain cases, evidence such as direct observation of the behavior or lab values such as laxatives found in the stool may simplify diagnosis. However, many cases lack definitive evidence, and determining what level of evidence is sufficient for diagnosis may be challenging.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21573.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>Some argue that the DSM does not recognize that deception is normal human behavior and should not be considered pathologic in all cases. It is very common for patients to exaggerate symptoms to receive the attention they desire. This further complicates diagnosis because the threshold at which the behavior is considered pathological is unclear.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21573.r3">[3]</xref></p>

        <p>Studies show that the only currently available effective treatment for factitious disorder is psychotherapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21573.r16">[16]</xref> Based on available research, medication does not significantly improve symptoms of factitious disorder. However, patients with factitious disorder often have comorbid psychiatric conditions such as depression.

One major barrier to initiating proper treatment is the willingness of the patient. Many experts feel that it is necessary to confront the patient before any treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21573.r18">[18]</xref>&#x000a0;A strategy must be developed before the confrontation to minimize embarrassment and accusations. Some experts recommend that an interprofessional approach be utilized.

Some experts argue that once a diagnosis is made, confrontation is not necessary and recommend an approach intended to build a trusting relationship with the patient.

            <p>Malingering - the conscious feigning of symptomatology to obtain secondary gain - is&#x000a0;1 of the most difficult diagnoses to distinguish from factitious disorder, as motivation may be difficult to ascertain in many cases.
