        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>HIV prophylaxis is divided into 2 categories: post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). PEP is the administration of antiretroviral therapy to an HIV-negative person who may be exposed to HIV. Exposure can be occupational (oPEP) or non-occupational (nPEP), with non-occupational exposure being related to sexual or intravenous (IV) drug exposures. PrEP is the use of antiretroviral drugs in a high-risk, HIV-negative patient to prevent future HIV infections.</p>

<bold>Background</bold>
</italic>
</p>
        <p>The risk of HIV transmission after exposure is variable and linked to viral load; higher viral load increases the risk of transmission. High viral loads can be seen in acute and early HIV infection. Coinfection with other sexual infections also increases the transmission of HIV infection. Although no prospective randomized clinical trial has been done to show the efficacy of PEP, some observational and case studies, along with expert opinion, have suggested that PEP might be useful in high-risk populations, and it has led to widespread acceptance.</p>
        <p>In 1997, Cardo and collaborators published a case-control study on HIV prevention. They showed an 81% reduction in HIV transmission in healthcare workers when given zidovudine after percutaneous exposure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22920.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Since then, many other clinical and observational studies have supported the use of PEP.</p>

<italic toggle="yes">
<bold>Risk of HIV transmission</bold>
</italic>
</p>
        <p>The risk of HIV transmission differs and depends on the exposure route. It has done studies to estimate the per-act HIV transmission risk from an infected source to an HIV-negative person. The estimated highest per-act risk for acquiring HIV through a blood transfusion is 9250 per 10,000. Receptive anal intercourse (138 per 10,000), needle-sharing drug users (63 per 10,000), and percutaneous needle stick injuries (23 per 10,000) also had high levels of HIV transmission. Receptive penile-vaginal intercourse (8 per 10,000), insertive penile-vaginal intercourse (4 per 10,000), and oral sex (low) have much lower rates of transmission.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22920.r2">[2]</xref></p>

</italic>
</p>
        <p>nPEP&#x000a0;should&#x000a0;start&#x000a0;as soon as post-exposure has occurred for high-risk exposures and can start&#x000a0;up to 72 hours after the event. It breaks exposure risks into 3 categories: negligible, intermediate, and substantial.</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Negligible risk&#x000a0;is the exposure of vagina, rectum, eye, mouth, or other mucous membranes, intact or non-intact skin, or percutaneous contact with nasal secretions, urine, saliva, tears, or sweat if not visibly infected with blood, regardless of the contact HIV status.&#x000a0;Negligible risk is not&#x000a0;an indication&#x000a0;for&#x000a0;nPEP.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Substantial risk is the exposure of the vagina, rectum, eye, mouth, or other mucous membranes, non-intact skin, or percutaneous contact with semen, blood, vaginal secretions,&#x000a0;breast milk, and rectal&#x000a0;secretions that can&#x000a0;visibly contaminate the&#x000a0;blood when the source&#x000a0;is known&#x000a0;to be HIV positive. For substantial risk,&#x000a0;nPEP&#x000a0;is&#x000a0;recommended.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Intermediate risk is the exposure of the vagina, rectum, eye, mouth, or other mucous membranes, non-intact skin, or percutaneous contact with blood, vaginal secretions, semen, rectal secretions, or any fluid visually contaminated with blood. When the source patient's HIV status is unknown, there is no recommendation for or against nPEP, but the risks and benefits should be tested on a case-by-case basis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22920.r3">[3]</xref>.&#x000a0;nPEP is not recommended if the patients present over 72 hours after exposure.&#x000a0;</p>

<italic toggle="yes">
<bold>Diagnostic Testing</bold>
</italic>
</p>
        <p>HIV&#x000a0;nPEP should only start in patients who are HIV-negative because a person presenting for nPEP treatment may already be HIV-positive and unaware of their status. Baseline HIV testing should be performed on all patients before starting nPEP. The CDC and NIH recommend the use of a rapid Ab or rapid Ag/Ab test. If early testing is unavailable, a non-rapid test should be performed, and nPEP can be offered while results are pending.</p>
        <p>When a&#x000a0;patient is being tested for nPEP, one should also offer to test for other sexually transmitted diseases, including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. A pregnancy test should be done. Physicians&#x000a0;should also test antiretroviral medications' renal and hepatic toxicity, a baseline creatinine, AST, and ALT.</p>
        <p>It recommends follow-up labs&#x000a0;at 4 to 6 weeks, including a repeat HIV test, creatinine, AST, ALT, syphilis test, and pregnancy test. Repeat HIV testing should also occur three months after exposure to determine if HIV infection has occurred. Additionally, it recommends testing at 6 months in patients with hepatitis C since this infection often has a delay in seroconversion.</p>
        <p>
<italic toggle="yes">
<bold>Recommended Treatment</bold>
</italic>
</p>
        <p>Once starting with nPEP, the recommended protocol is a 28-day course of 3 medications. The preferred medication regimen for adults and adolescents aged older than 13 years, with normal renal function (creatinine clearance equal to 60 mL per min), including pregnant women, is tenofovir DF 300 mg and fixed-dose combination emtricitabine 200 mg (Truvada) once daily with raltegravir 400 mg twice daily or dolutegravir 50 mg once daily. Alternative regimens are available for patients with renal dysfunction and children 12 years and younger.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22920.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>Adherence plays a vital role in effectiveness. Patients with suboptimal adherence have higher rates of failure. Studies comparing tenofovir-containing regimens with zidovudine-containing regimens have shown that patients given tenofovir-containing regimens do well. They can tolerate it with fewer side effects and have higher completion rates.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22920.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>It should provide additional treatment for other STIs, including hepatitis B, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia when the diagnosis is confirmed.</p>
        <p>If nPEP fails, patients may develop signs and symptoms of acute HIV infection. Patients should know the signs and symptoms of acute HIV infection and be instructed to return if they become symptomatic. It usually associates acute HIV infection with a high viral load. Common symptoms include fever, fatigue, myalgia, and a skin rash. Less common symptoms include headaches, pharyngitis, cervical adenopathy, arthralgia, night sweats, and diarrhea.</p>

<bold>Risk of Transmission</bold>
</italic>
</p>
        <p>The average risk of HIV transmission after occupational exposure is 0.3%. Risk varies depending on the exposure. It estimates the risk of percutaneous exposure at 0.23%, mucous membrane exposure at 0.09%, and cutaneous exposure at less than 0.09%. Several factors may be associated with an increased risk of HIV transmission, including injuries from hollow-bore needles, visibly bloody devices, deep tissue injuries, and injuries during procedures involving a needle or device being positioned in an artery or vein.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22920.r1">[1]</xref></p>

        <p>oPEP&#x000a0;should start&#x000a0;as soon as possible, ideally within 2 hours. It should not delay the initiation of oPEP while waiting for information or test results from the source patient. If&#x000a0;oPEP is started and later determined by the source patient to be negative, then&#x000a0;oPEP&#x000a0;can be discontinued, and no further evaluation or treatment is necessary.</p>

</p>
        <p>It recommends HIV testing of the source patient&#x000a0;whenever possible.&#x000a0;Voluntary testing of the source patient is required, and laws on consent for testing differ by state. A rapid test is mandatory where available. If the source patient reports a high-risk exposure within the preceding six weeks, some guidelines (though not the CDC) recommend HIV RNA assay. HIV RNA can test the patient for infection during the "window period," which is the time frame between contracting the virus and developing an antibody response. However, there have been no documented cases of transmission during this window period. The source patient may test for hepatitis C (HCV) RNA and hepatitis B (HBV) surface antigen.<bold/></p>

        <p>Baseline HIV testing of the exposed worker should be done after occupational exposure, even if the exposed worker declines PEP. It can then perform repeat HIV testing at 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months post-exposure. Other baseline tests conducted on the patient at the time of the initial presentation should include HCV antibody and HBV if the individual has not been vaccinated against hepatitis B.</p>

<bold>Background</bold>
</italic>
</p>
        <p>In 2015, about 1.1 million people aged 13 and older in the United States were living with HIV. The number of new HIV diagnoses in the United States in 2015 was 38,500, which has declined since 2010. Although rates are falling overall, rates of new HIV diagnoses in specific subpopulations are not following this trend. Black men (especially males having sex with males-MSM) have shown no change, and rates among Hispanic MSM are increasing.</p>
        <p>HIV seems to affect specific subsets of the population disproportionately. In 2015, 67% of newly diagnosed HIV cases were among MSM. 55% of new diagnoses were among adolescents and young adults (age 13 to 34), and 44% of new diagnoses were among blacks.</p>
        <p>It developed PrEP to help reduce the number of new HIV diagnoses. PrEP therapy includes tenofovir-emtricitabine,&#x000a0;a single pill taken daily to prevent HIV infection. Multiple clinical studies have shown this regimen to be useful for PrEP. Overall, when taken as prescribed, PrEP has been found PrEP to be over 90% effective in preventing HIV infection. Based on that, the FDA approved the use of&#x000a0;tenofovir-emtricitabine&#x000a0;for PrEP in 2012, and in 2014, PrEP clinical practice guidelines were developed by the CDC.</p>

        <p>PrEP is indicated for only HIV-negative patients; thus, an initial HIV test should always be performed. A physician&#x000a0;can examine&#x000a0;the patients for signs and symptoms of acute HIV infection. Primary HIV infection symptoms include fever, fatigue, myalgia, rash, headache, pharyngitis, cervical lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, night sweats, and diarrhea. If signs of acute HIV are present and the initial HIV test is negative, the patient may still be infected with HIV but have no detectable HIV antibodies (the "window period"). Recommended evaluation for patients possibly in the window period includes HIV antigen/antibody test, checking viral load, or rechecking HIV status in 1 month.</p>

        <p><italic toggle="yes">The possibility of continuing or increasing high-risk behavior:</italic> High-risk behavior includes condom-less sex, multiple partners, and insertive anal intercourse. Studies investigating this idea have shown mixed results. The majority showed no&#x000a0;increase in high-risk behavior after receiving nPEP; however, a few studies showed nPEP users being more likely to have multiple partners or to engage in condom-less sex. Two of these studies showed that nPEP users were more likely to become HIV positive than patients who did not receive nPEP.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22920.r3">[3]</xref></p>

        <p>The emotional effects of HIV exposure can be substantial, and proper follow-up and counseling can benefit all patients. Prompt follow-up provides an opportunity for patients to ask questions, ensures education, can increase compliance, and can help the patient with managing side effects.
