        <p>Omphalitis is an infection of the umbilicus and surrounding tissues, most commonly seen in neonates. This condition is classified as a medical emergency due to its potential for rapid progression to systemic infection, sepsis, and even death, with a mortality rate estimated between 7%e and 15%. Early recognition is crucial; signs may include redness, swelling, and discharge at the umbilical site, along with systemic symptoms such as fever or lethargy. Timely evaluation and treatment, often involving antibiotics and supportive care, are essential to prevent significant morbidity and mortality associated with this condition.</p>
        <p>Through this course, participants learn to effectively evaluate and manage omphalitis, recognizing its clinical features and understanding the urgency of treatment. The course emphasizes the importance of interprofessional collaboration among healthcare professionals, including pediatricians, nurses, and infection control specialists, to ensure comprehensive management. By working as a cohesive team, clinicians can improve early detection, optimize treatment protocols, and enhance overall patient outcomes, ultimately reducing the risks associated with omphalitis in vulnerable neonates.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Omphalitis is an infection of the umbilicus and/or surrounding tissues, primarily in the neonatal period that is limited to around the umbilicus in most newborns. However, it&#x000a0;can rapidly progress to systemic infection and death, with an estimated mortality rate between 7%&#x000a0;to 15%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26170.r1">[1]</xref> Early recognition and treatment are essential to prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with omphalitis.&#x000a0;</p>

      <sec id="article-26170.s3" sec-type="Etiology">
        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>Immediately after birth, the umbilicus becomes colonized with many different types of bacteria. Gram-positive cocci are present within hours, followed shortly by many enteric microorganisms. The devitalized tissues of the umbilical stump promote the rapid growth of these bacteria, and the thrombosed blood vessels allow entry into the bloodstream, potentially leading to systemic infection.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-26170.s4" sec-type="Epidemiology">
        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>Omphalitis is uncommon&#x000a0;beyond the neonatal age. Symptoms typically begin at an average age of 3 days. This is a rare disease in developed countries, with an incidence of 0.7%. However, in developing countries, the incidence of neonates delivered at hospitals can approach 8%, and if born at home, the incidence can be as high as 22%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26170.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26170.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Risk factors for the development of omphalitis include low birth weight, prolonged rupture of membranes, maternal infection, umbilical catheterization, nonsterile delivery, maternal infection, prolonged labor, home birth, and improper cord care.</p>
        <p>The cultural application of cow dung, seen in developing nations, is also associated with higher rates of omphalitis. In addition, immune system abnormalities such as defective leukocyte adhesion, poor neutrophil mobility, low natural killer function, and interferon production have been associated with an increased risk of omphalitis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26170.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;A history of delayed separation of the umbilical cord stump and omphalitis after birth age with recurrent infections in infancy should raise the suspicion of leukocyte adhesion disorder (LAD) and an appropriate workup must be done. Apart from omphalitis, children with LAD commonly have recurrent pneumonia, soft tissue infections, and gingivitis.</p>

      <sec id="article-26170.s5" sec-type="Pathophysiology">
        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>The umbilical cord is the lifeline between the baby and mother during pregnancy and is cut after birth. The umbilical cord stump then gradually dries and typically falls off within 5 to 15 days. Skin and enteric bacteria may colonize the devitalized tissue of the stump and lead to infection. Omphalitis is, therefore, a polymicrobial infection, and the most common pathogens are <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus,</italic><italic toggle="yes">&#x000a0;Streptococcus pyogenes, </italic>and gram-negative bacteria such as&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae,&#x000a0;</italic>and&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Proteus mirabilis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26170.r5">[5]</xref></italic> If maternal infection with chorioamnionitis is suspected, anaerobic bacteria such as&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens,&#x000a0;</italic>and&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Clostridium tetani</italic> can also contribute to infection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26170.r6">[6]</xref></p>

        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>Omphalitis is primarily a neonate disease characterized by tenderness, erythema, and induration of the umbilicus and surrounding tissues. Early on, patients may only have superficial cellulitis, but if untreated, this can involve the entire abdominal wall. Patients may also have purulent drainage or bleeding from the umbilical cord stump. Foul-smelling&#x000a0;discharge should raise the suspicion of anaerobic infection. Systemic symptoms such as lethargy, poor feeding, fever, and irritability suggest sepsis and portend a worse prognosis. If there is a rapid progression of abdominal wall erythema or gas in the surrounding tissues, necrotizing fasciitis should be considered, and acute surgical consultation is needed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26170.r7">[7]</xref></p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-26170.s7" sec-type="Evaluation">
        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>Laboratory evaluation with complete blood count and culture should be obtained for all patients with suspected omphalitis. In addition, if possible, cultures of any purulent material from the umbilical stump should be sent before the initiation of antibiotics. A full neonatal septic workup should be obtained if the patient has systemic symptoms, including a chest radiograph, urinalysis, urine culture, and cerebrospinal fluid culture. As omphalitis is closely linked to leucocyte adhesion disorders, a detailed workup is necessary in suspected cases. Leucocytosis, due to defective&#x000a0;margination of leucocytes,&#x000a0;is almost always present in LAD. Leukocyte adhesion molecules or integrins, including LFA-1/Mac-1, p150, and p95, are absent in children with LAD. Therefore, an assay of these receptors is essential in children presenting with recurrent infections and having a history of omphalitis in the neonatal age.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26170.r8">[8]</xref></p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-26170.s8" sec-type="Treatment / Management">
        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>Broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics are required to treat omphalitis. Antibiotic coverage should be directed against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Initial empiric treatment with antistaphylococcal penicillin and aminoglycoside&#x000a0;is recommended. If there is a high prevalence of methicillin-resistant&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus, </italic>vancomycin should be administered while awaiting culture results. If there is suspicion of maternal chorioamnionitis or the patient has a foul-smelling discharge from the stump, clindamycin or metronidazole is indicated to cover for anaerobes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26170.r6">[6]</xref> The duration of antibiotic therapy depends on the patient's clinical response and any complications that may develop during hospital admission. For uncomplicated cases of omphalitis, the recommended course of parenteral therapy is ten days, followed by a switch to oral therapy, depending on culture results.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-26170.s9" sec-type="Differential Diagnosis">
        <title>Differential Diagnosis</title>
        <p>In most cases, the clinical picture of omphalitis is sufficient to make the diagnosis. A patent urachus, which results in direct communication between the bladder and umbilicus, can be mistaken for infection due to persistent drainage from the umbilicus. Umbilical granulomas may also be misdiagnosed as an umbilical infection because the friable tissue can cause serous or serosanguinous drainage and easy bleeding with trauma. These typically occur after the first week of life and can be distinguished by their soft, velvety texture and pinkish color. Umbilical polyps are firm masses of urachal embryologic remnants that often require surgical excision but do not cause infection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26170.r9">[9]</xref> If inflammation of the umbilical cord alone is present, then funisitis and not omphalitis is the diagnosis. Funisitis, caused by maternal chorioamnionitis, involves only the external surface of the cord and not the umbilical vessels. A wet, foul-smelling cord stump without any surrounding cellulitis&#x000a0;characterizes funisitis.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-26170.s10" sec-type="Complications">
        <title>Complications</title>
        <p>Early recognition and treatment of omphalitis are essential to prevent the serious complications of this disease. Sepsis is the most common complication and can progress to septic shock and death. Other rare complications include peritonitis, intestinal gangrene, small bowel evisceration, liver abscess, septic umbilical arteritis, and portal vein thrombosis. Although uncommon, necrotizing fasciitis can occur and should be suspected if there is a rapid progression of infection and signs of systemic toxicity; it should also be suspected if there is no clinical improvement with intravenous antibiotics in 24 to 48 hours. Mortality rates as high as 60% to 85% have been reported in patients with omphalitis complicated by necrotizing fasciitis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26170.r10">[10]</xref> If suspected, in addition to the broad-spectrum antibiotics, prompt surgical consultation for debridement of the umbilical structures and the involved abdominal wall is essential.</p>

      <sec id="article-26170.s11" sec-type="Deterrence and Patient Education">
        <title>Deterrence and Patient Education</title>
        <p>Prevention of omphalitis requires both aseptic techniques during delivery services and proper cord care. The umbilical cord should be cut with a sterile blade or scissors. In the hospital setting where aseptic care is routine and the risk of omphalitis is low, dry cord care is recommended. In developing countries with a higher risk of omphalitis, chlorhexidine as a topical agent has been shown to reduce the risk of omphalitis inexpensively. In a meta-analysis of studies conducted in developing countries' community settings, chlorhexidine reduced all-cause mortality and the risk of omphalitis compared to dry cord care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26170.r11">[11]</xref> Inappropriate cord care has also increased the risk of umbilical infection. The cultural application of cow dung or bentonite clay to the umbilical stump has resulted in neonatal tetanus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26170.r12">[12]</xref></p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>Since&#x000a0;early recognition may prevent omphalitis, the entire healthcare team must work together to ensure&#x000a0;aseptic techniques during delivery and maintain proper cord care after delivery. The umbilical cord should be cut with a sterile blade or scissors. All team members must work towards supporting and assisting each other in keeping the field sterile, and appropriate antiseptic techniques&#x000a0;must be maintained.</p>
