        <p>Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is an infectious condition transmitted through the bite of infected ticks, primarily caused by the spirochete bacterium <italic toggle="yes">Borrelia burgdorferi </italic>in the United States and various <italic toggle="yes">Borrelia</italic> species in Europe and Asia. This disease progresses through three stages: early localized, early disseminated, and late disease. Initial symptoms often include a characteristic "bull's-eye" rash (erythema migrans), fever, and fatigue. If left untreated, the infection can advance to affect multiple systems, potentially leading to neurological symptoms, cardiac complications, and arthritis. The late stage may present with chronic arthritis and encephalopathy, underscoring the importance of early diagnosis and treatment.</p>
        <p>Through this continuing education course, healthcare professionals gain valuable insights into the recognition of Lyme disease's clinical features and the implementation of appropriate diagnostic and treatment strategies. The course emphasizes the importance of a 2-step serologic testing process for accurate diagnosis and highlights the benefits of early antibiotic intervention to prevent disease progression. Participants learn how to effectively collaborate with an interprofessional team, including specialists in infectious diseases, neurology, and rheumatology, to enhance patient management and outcomes. This collaborative approach ensures comprehensive care, addressing various aspects of the disease and its complications, ultimately leading to improved patient recovery and quality of life.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Lyme disease, or Lyme borreliosis, is the most commonly transmitted tick-borne infection in the United States (US) and among the most frequently diagnosed tick-borne infections worldwide. Lyme disease is divided into&#x000a0;3 stages: early localized, early disseminated, and late. Early localized disease is distinguished by the red ring-like expanding rash of erythema migrans at the site of a recent tick bite. Other symptoms experienced at this stage may be malaise, headache, fever, myalgia, and arthralgia. Most patients only experience the symptoms of early localized disease. About 20% of patients develop early disseminated disease, with the most common symptoms being multiple erythema migrans lesions.</p>
        <p>Other symptoms of the disseminated stage are flu-like symptoms, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, myalgia, palsies of the cranial nerves, especially of cranial nerve VII, ophthalmic conditions, and lymphocytic meningitis. Additionally, cardiac manifestations, including conduction abnormalities, myocarditis, or pericarditis, may occur. The most common late-stage manifestation is arthritis, which is usually pauciarticular and affects large joints, especially the knees.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Lyme disease is a&#x000a0;curable condition if identified and treated appropriately.</p>

      <sec id="article-24539.s3" sec-type="Etiology">
        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>In the US, Lyme disease is caused by the bacterial spirochete <italic toggle="yes">Borrelia burgdorferi (</italic>and rarely <italic toggle="yes">Borrelia mayonii)</italic>&#x000a0;and is transmitted by the bite of an <italic toggle="yes">Ixodes</italic> genus black-legged tick. In Europe and Asia, the predominant causes of Lyme disease are&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">B</italic><italic toggle="yes">&#x000a0;burgdorferi</italic>,&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Borrelia</italic><italic toggle="yes">&#x000a0;afzelii</italic>,&#x000a0;and&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Borrelia</italic><italic toggle="yes">&#x000a0;garinii</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;In Asia, <italic toggle="yes">B garinii</italic> is the most common cause of Lyme disease.&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">B burgdorferi</italic> has a particular affinity for joints, while&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">B garinii</italic>&#x000a0;has a predilection for nervous system tissue.&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">B afzelii</italic> has an affinity for the skin. In the US,&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Borrelia </italic>spp are transmitted by ticks, with <italic toggle="yes">Ixodes scapularis</italic>&#x000a0;being the main vector in the Northeastern and upper Midwest regions and&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Ixodes pacificus</italic>&#x000a0;in the Western region.&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Ixodes ricinus</italic>&#x000a0;and&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Ixodes persulcatus</italic>&#x000a0;are&#x000a0;the main species in Europe and Asia, respectively.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The tick lifecycle is significant to understanding when they are infectious. They have a 2- to 3-year life span and cycle through 4 life stages: egg, larva, nymph, and adult. The larva and nymph must take a blood meal to advance to the next life stage, and the female ticks require blood to reproduce. During these meals, ticks become infected with the bacteria. Ticks attach to an animal host reservoir, typically&#x000a0;birds or other small mammals such as mice and voles, and feed anywhere from 3 to 7 days. While ticks can feed on any mammal, deer are not a natural reservoir of the spirochete. Those infected nymphs and adult ticks spread the bacteria each time they subsequently feed.&#x000a0;</p>

      <sec id="article-24539.s4" sec-type="Epidemiology">
        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>Lyme disease is most commonly reported in the Northeastern and upper Midwestern US regions. The primary states with endemic Lyme disease are Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Sporadic cases have been reported in northern California, Oregon, and Washington.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r6">[6]</xref></p>
        <p>The infection tends to occur during late spring, summer, and early fall, coinciding with activity of the nymph feeding and more interaction of people in spaces that increase the risk for a tick bite. In 2022, 62,551 cases of Lyme disease in the US were reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/data-research/facts-stats/surveillance-data-1.html">cdc.gov/lyme</ext-link> Other estimates place the actual number of cases much higher. More men than women tend to be affected. The age distribution is bimodal, with more children younger than 15 and adults 45 and older affected. Lyme disease can affect people of all ethnic backgrounds, but most cases reported are in White individuals.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-24539.s5" sec-type="Pathophysiology">
        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>The <italic toggle="yes">Borrelia</italic> spirochete lives in the midgut of the tick. Once the tick feeds, blood from the affected host triggers the proliferation of the spirochetes and induces&#x000a0;the spirochete to&#x000a0;express a protein called outer surface protein C, which allows the spirochete to invade the tick salivary glands by moving from the midgut closer to the tick mouthpiece. This process takes time and varies by species of tick and spirochete, but it explains why transmission to human hosts requires a tick to be attached to the host for more than 15 hours in most cases. During transmission, the spirochetes are deposited in the skin and then disseminated from the site of inoculation to other areas of the body.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The infected host's innate and adaptive immune system triggers macrophage- and antibody-mediated killing of the spirochetes. In some cases, the immune system can clear the infection without evidence of developing disease. However, due to sophisticated mechanisms by the spirochete to evade the host immune response, the infection may persist and develop clinically evident disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;The host inflammatory response is responsible for causing tissue damage in organs, including the heart, nervous tissue, and joints. The spirochete itself is not known to be directly toxic.</p>
        <p>The pathophysiology of posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) is unclear. Several theories have been suggested, though no evidence has been reported to support the existence of chronic <italic toggle="yes">B burgdorferi</italic> infection. Some active pathology may be present after the initial clearance of the microbes, the persistence of inappropriate immune activation and inflammation, or some combination of both. No one leading proposal has been established, and more research is needed in this area.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>For patients who develop postinfectious Lyme arthritis, a complex interplay is proposed between bacterial and host factors. No active infection can be identified&#x000a0;in these cases, yet there is objective evidence of ongoing inflammation of the joints. The persistence of bacterial debris may continue to trigger immune activation. Additionally, immune system overactivation by protein-specific bacteria is possible.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r9">[9]</xref></p>

        <title>Histopathology</title>
        <p>
<bold>Erythema Migrans</bold>
</p>
        <p>A biopsy of erythema migrans is not needed to establish a diagnosis. Erythema migrans histologic findings&#x000a0;are nonspecific, usually showing a perivascular cellular infiltrate consisting of histiocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Rarely are mast cells and neutrophils identified. A biopsy may show eosinophilic infiltrates, representing a local reaction to the bite. Spirochetes may be identified using antibody-labeled or silver stains but are typically rarely identified in skin specimens and should not be used as a basis for diagnosis.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Acrodermatitis Chronica&#x000a0;Atrophicans</bold>
</p>
        <p>Histopathology is essential for the diagnosis of acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, which may overlap and be confused clinically with morphea, mycosis fungicides, or lichen sclerosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;Interstitial granulomatous infiltrates, which are CD68-positive, are common, and CD3-positive lymphocytes are predominant. Histiocytes are also part of the infiltrates in all cases. Plasma cells may be seen rarely but can be visualized by staining for CD138. Thickened collagen bundles and band-like infiltrates of CD4 T cells are other common features. Interstitial fibroblasts are also reduced and can be seen by staining for CD34.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Borrelial&#x000a0;Lymphocytoma</bold>
</p>
        <p>Histologic examination is performed in patients with suspected&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Borrelia</italic>&#x000a0;lymphocytoma when the history is unclear enough to support a diagnosis, but the histopathology is generally nonspecific. Evaluating for other causes of nodules and ruling out neoplasm can help. The&#x000a0;biopsy tends to show a dense dermal polyclonal lymphocytic infiltrate with lymphoid follicles and pseudoterminal centers or a pseudolymphoma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r11">[11]</xref></p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-24539.s7" sec-type="History and Physical">
        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>Lyme disease is classified into 3 stages: early localized, early disseminated, and&#x000a0;late.&#x000a0;Approximately 1.6% to 7% of individuals may have an asymptomatic Lyme infection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;In most cases, however, patients develop symptoms of Lyme disease, with erythema migrans being the most common initial manifestation. Erythema migrans is characteristic of early localized disease, occurring 1 to 2 weeks after a tick bite. Patients may develop early disseminated or late disease if the infection persists or goes untreated.</p>
        <p>Early disseminated disease is associated with neurologic and cardiac manifestations. Neurologic Lyme disease manifestations include facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) palsy, lymphocytic meningitis, or radiculopathy. Cardiac involvement may consist of myopericarditis and heart block. Lyme arthritis is typically a late disease manifestation and may be monoarticular or pauciarticular, generally involving large joints, most commonly the knee, and occurring months&#x000a0;after the initial tick bite.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;Because the symptoms are not specific, clinicians should consider other conditions and infections transmitted by ticks (eg, coinfection with <italic toggle="yes">Babesia microti</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Ehrlichia</italic>). Coinfection has been reported in approximately 10% of patients.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Early Localized Disease</bold>
</p>
        <p>The early localized phase of Lyme disease may present with an erythema migrans rash and low-grade fever. This stage usually occurs within 1 to 28 days following the tick bite.&#x000a0;The&#x000a0;erythema migrans rash is seen in 70% of patients and may develop between 7 to 14 days following the tick bite. The uniform rash usually occurs at the tick bite site and may burn, itch, or be asymptomatic. The rash tends to expand for a few days, and concentric rings may be visible (see<bold> Image.</bold>&#x000a0;Lyme Disease "Bulls-Eye" Rash).</p>
        <p>If left untreated, the rash persists for 2 to 3 weeks and may expand to 20 cm in diameter. About 20% of patients may have recurrent episodes of the rash, and multiple lesions are not uncommon. At the same time, flu-like symptoms may be present. A low-grade fever may be associated with myalgia, neck stiffness, and headache. Visual problems include eye redness and tearing.<bold>&#x000a0;</bold></p>
        <p>
<bold>Early Disseminated Disease</bold>
</p>
        <p>Stage 2 is the early disseminated phase of the disease process. This stage usually develops 3 to 12 weeks after the initial infection. Features may include general malaise, fever, neurological&#x000a0;symptoms (dizziness and headache), muscle pain, or cardiac symptoms (chest pain, palpitations, and dyspnea). About 20% of patients have centrl nervous system involvement, including meningitis, cranial neuropathies, radiculopathy, peripheral neuropathy, cerebellar symptoms, or rarely encephalomyelitis. Bell palsy affecting the facial nerve is seen in approximately 5% of patients. The classic triad includes meningitis, cranial neuropathy, and motor or sensory radiculoneuropathy, but these features may occur alone.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Cardiac involvement may present with arrhythmias or transient heart block. Conduction abnormalities are not uncommon, but most cases are isolated and rarely last more than a few days. Seldom does a patient require permanent pacing. Sporadic cases of sudden cardiac death have occurred due to&#x000a0;fulminant carditis.</p>
        <p>Ocular manifestations have also been described, with conjunctivitis being the most common feature and keratitis, iridocyclitis, retinal vasculitis, optic neuropathy, and uveitis being rare.&#x000a0;Borrelial&#x000a0;lymphocytoma is a rare presentation of early Lyme disease reported mainly in Europe; this condition tends to occur weeks to several months after the initial infection. Borrelial&#x000a0;lymphocytoma&#x000a0;presents as a slow-growing, painless plaque or nodule, which is red-bluish in coloration and usually occurs on the ear lobe in children or the breast in adults.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;The lesion may resolve spontaneously.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Late Disease</bold>
</p>
        <p>Late-stage Lyme disease may occur months after the initial infection. The typical features include neurological and musculoskeletal&#x000a0;involvement. Many patients may not have a history of erythema migrans. However, these individuals may present with sensory axonal polyneuropathy, encephalomyelitis, or mononeuropathy. Cognitive deficits are common. Encephalopathy presents with deficits in concentration, cognition, memory loss, and personality changes. Extreme irritability and depression are also common. Encephalomyelitis is rare and can present with ataxia, seizures, hemiparesis, autonomic dysfunction, and hearing loss.</p>
        <p>Lyme arthritis tends to affect large joints, especially the knee. Symptoms manifest as joint pain with swelling and stiffness. Smaller joints, such as the elbow, may be involved, and episodes of bursitis or tendinitis may occur.&#x000a0;Over time, in most cases, symptoms tend to subside even without intervention. In a small proportion of patients with Lyme arthritis, chronic inflammatory arthritis similar to rheumatoid arthritis may develop. This complication of Lyme disease is termed postinfectious Lyme arthritis.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is typically seen in older women and tends to occur on the dorsum of the hands and feet. This rash presents as bluish-red discoloration with some swelling that progresses very slowly as an expansive lesion, leading the skin to become atrophic over time; this may occur years following the primary infection, has been described chiefly in European cohorts, and may be confused with morphea.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-24539.s8" sec-type="Evaluation">
        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>A challenge in evaluating Lyme disease is that many patients diagnosed with the disease often have no recollection of a tick bite or a rash. Symptoms may be vague in most patients, and testing is needed in those cases where Lyme disease is suspected as an underlying etiology. Therefore, the CDC recommends a 2-step serologic testing process using US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared assays.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Serologic testing is&#x000a0;unreliable during the first few weeks of infection, given the time needed for seroconversion. Patients presenting with erythema migrans rash and a history of residing in or traveling to an endemic region of Lyme disease may&#x000a0;be treated based on clinical findings. In later stages of the disease, the 2-step approach is recommended for the serologic diagnosis of Lyme disease. The first step is to perform a quantitative screening test for serum antibodies to <italic toggle="yes">B burgdorferi</italic> using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or immunofluorescent antibody assay.</p>
        <p>If this step is negative, no further testing is recommended. A Western blot should follow specimens with positive or equivocal results. Standard 2-tier testing uses EIA as the first step and Western blot as the 2nd step. According to the CDC, an immunoblot is positive if at least 2 of 3 bands are present on the immunoglobulin (Ig) IgM immunoblot within 30 days of symptom onset or 5 to 10 bands are present on the IgG immunoblot at any time.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r13">[13]</xref> Serologic diagnosis is greater than 80% sensitive for patients with neurologic or cardiac manifestations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r14">[14]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r15">[15]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r16">[16]</xref></p>
        <p>Sequential serological testing is not recommended in the acute state because antibody titers often remain elevated for a long time. Testing the tick is also not recommended.&#x000a0;False positive results may occur in patients with other conditions, including syphilis, rheumatoid arthritis, relapsing fever, and Epstein-Barr infection.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Suspected Cardiac Manifestations</bold>
</p>
        <p>Serologic testing is recommended for patients presenting with&#x000a0;acute myocarditis or pericarditis of unknown cause in an appropriate epidemiologic setting.&#x000a0;Specific cardiac testing with a screening electrocardiogram is recommended for patients presenting with&#x000a0;dyspnea, edema, palpitations, lightheadedness, chest pain, and syncope and living in a Lyme endemic area.&#x000a0;For those presenting with more severe potential manifestations, including&#x000a0;exercise intolerance, palpitations, presyncope, syncope, pericardial pain, evidence of pericardial effusion, elevated biomarkers, edema, shortness of breath, or evidence of PR interval prolongation &#x000a0;of more than 300 milliseconds, admission to the hospital for continuous electrocardiogram monitoring is recommended.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Suspected Neurologic Manifestations</bold>

        <p>Lyme disease treatment is divided into the following categories:</p>
        <p><bold>Asymptomatic patients with potential exposure:&#x000a0;</bold>Asymptomatic children and adults with a known tick bite should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics of&#x000a0;a single dose of oral doxycycline 200&#x000a0;mg for adults and 4.4&#x000a0;mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 200&#x000a0;mg) for children if&#x000a0;the tick bite was from any of the following:</p>

          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p><bold>Erythema migrans rash:&#x000a0;</bold>Patients with 1 or more classic appearing erythema migrans rash in an endemic area for Lyme disease should be treated without further testing. Oral antibiotic therapy should be used with a 10-day course of doxycycline or a 14-day course of amoxicillin or cefuroxime axetil. Second-line therapy is 5 to 10 days of azithromycin for those patients intolerant of or allergic to the former antibiotics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r17">[17]</xref>&#x000a0;To establish a diagnosis before antibiotic treatment, serologic testing is recommended for patients with an atypical rash but suggestive of erythema migrans.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p><bold>Neurologic manifestations:&#x000a0;</bold>Intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, penicillin G, or oral doxycycline is recommended over other antimicrobials for 14 to 21 days. IV is preferred, but choosing oral or IV antibiotics should be based on patient-specific factors such as tolerance, access, or risk for adverse effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r17">[17]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Cardiac manifestations:&#x000a0;</bold>For patients with symptomatic heart block, a temporary pacemaker may be placed over a permanent pacemaker, as in most cases with antibiotic treatment, heart block is reversible. Oral doxycycline as an outpatient is sufficient for patients with Lyme carditis and mild symptoms. For patients with Lyme carditis and more severe manifestations requiring hospitalization and monitoring,&#x000a0;IV ceftriaxone is preferred with a switch to an oral antibiotic as the patient clinically improves. A total of 14 to 21 days of antibiotics is recommended.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r17">[17]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Arthritis:&#x000a0;</bold>Lyme arthritis should be treated with oral doxycycline for 28 days. A second course of oral antibiotics may be administered to those with a partial response. For those who have had minimal or no response, IV ceftriaxone for 2 to 4 weeks can be administered.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r17">[17]</xref>&#x000a0;For patients who have developed postantibiotic Lyme arthritis refractory to a course of oral and a course of IV antibiotics, referral to a rheumatologist for consideration of intra-articular corticosteroid injections, use of disease-modifying agents or other advanced therapies should be considered.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p><bold>Borrelial lymphocytoma:&#x000a0;</bold>Oral antibiotic therapy for 14 days is recommended.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r17">[17]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Acrodermatitis chronica&#x000a0;atrophicans:&#x000a0;</bold>Oral antibiotic therapy for 21 to 28 days is recommended.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r17">[17]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Posttreatment Lyme Disease Syndrome&#x000a0;</bold>
</p>
        <p>Ten to 20% of patients with Lyme disease will not respond to treatment and can develop PTLDS after using antibiotics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r18">[18]</xref>&#x000a0;For patients with no objective manifestations of Lyme disease, such as active rash, cardiac or neurologic findings, or arthritis, but with&#x000a0;persistent or recurring nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, pain, or cognitive impairment following recommended treatment for Lyme disease, there is no evidence that additional antibiotic therapy confers any benefit. Patients are treated for symptom management. For arthralgia and myalgia, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, heating pads, and physical therapy may be used. For neurocognitive symptoms, cessation of any medications that may contribute to neurocognitive symptoms should be considered. These medications may include&#x000a0;benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, antihistamines, and opioids.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Referrals to rheumatology, neurology, physical rehabilitation, and psychiatry specialists may be helpful.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Antibiotic Refractory Lyme Arthritis</bold>
</p>
        <p>About 10% of patients with Lyme arthritis will experience persistent inflammatory arthritis that does not respond to 1 or more round of antibiotic treatments. If no evidence of persistent infection is identified, this manifestation may be called postinfectious Lyme arthritis. A referral to a rheumatologist is indicated for further evaluation and management.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Special Populations</bold>
</p>
        <p>Doxycycline is used in most patients except in young children and those who are pregnant. In children, amoxicillin remains the drug of choice.&#x000a0;For patients older than 8 with early, localized disease, doxycycline is recommended for 10 days. Patients younger than 8 should receive amoxicillin or cefuroxime for 14 days to avoid the potential for tooth staining caused by tetracycline use in young children.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r19">[19]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r20">[20]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r21">[21]</xref></p>
        <p>Clinicians should monitor patients for the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction when starting therapy, which involves a transient worsening of symptoms during the first 24 hours of treatment. The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is a cytokine-driven reaction to the antibiotic-mediated destruction of spirochetes. This&#x000a0;reaction is seen in 5% to 15% of patients and usually resolves within 1 to 2 days. Treatment should not be interrupted if this reaction occurs, but symptom therapy with acetaminophen and oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications can be helpful.&#x000a0;</p>

        <p>Lyme disease is a treatable and possibly preventable condition in the right circumstances. While many patients are unaware of a tick bite, those at risk of exposure are advised to implement personal protective measures to prevent the risk of exposure and infection by tick-borne pathogens.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r17">[17]</xref>&#x000a0;Chemical repellants containing N,N-Diethylmeta-toluamide (DEET), picaridin, ethyl-3-(N-n-butyl-Nacetyl) aminopropionate (IR3535), oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), p-methane-3,8-diol (PMD), 2-undecanone, or permethrin are recommended.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r17">[17]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Additional prevention measures include wearing shoes, long-sleeved shirts, and pants when outside, showering after coming in from outside and checking the clothes and body for ticks after being outdoors. Children should be examined for ticks, particularly on the scalp, around the ears, and in the groin and buttock regions. Found ticks should be removed mechanically (eg, a clean, fine-tipped tweezer). Observing the tick for its shape, size, and any identifying features can be helpful in reporting to the healthcare clinician.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Patients who develop Lyme disease symptoms after a tick bite (eg, flu-like symptoms, fevers, rash or nerve, joint, and heart problems), should seek medical attention immediately. For patients who develop no symptoms after a tick bite, no antibiotic therapy is recommended unless it is from a high-risk tick, in which case prophylactic antibiotic therapy may be considered.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24539.r17">[17]</xref>&#x000a0;Patients should be advised to monitor for the development of rash or systemic symptoms and return to a healthcare clinician to seek additional medical attention.&#x000a0;</p>

        <p>Based on the geographic distribution of the shared vector <italic toggle="yes">Ixodes</italic>
<italic toggle="yes">scapularis</italic>, coinfections with Lyme disease and human granulocytic anaplasmosis or babesiosis can occur.

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>The key to Lyme disease is prevention, recognition of complications, and prompt initiation of treatment once confirmed. Management spans the interprofessional continuum from the primary care setting to the specialist. Primary care clinicians, including family medicine, internal medicine, and pediatrics, can play a role in educating patients on preventing tick bites while hiking or working outdoors. These front-line clinicians may also help parents by showing them how to inspect their children for ticks at the end of an outdoor event in an endemic area and manage a tick bite if it occurs.</p>
        <p>Primary care, urgent care, and emergency medicine professionals play a critical role in recognizing the symptoms and signs of Lyme disease, ranging from appropriate identification of a bull's eye rash and prompt initiation of treatment to recognition and evaluation for later-stage findings of the disease. These individuals must know how to appropriately order and interpret serological tests for Lyme disease and when to refer patients who develop cardiac, neurological, musculoskeletal, or dermatologic manifestations.</p>
        <p>Primary care clinicians can also work with infectious diseases to determine the accuracy of diagnosis or in more complex cases where management decisions require further input. Other specialists can help interpret advanced testing such as cardiac imaging, electrocardiography findings, radiologic imaging, lab results, and additional advanced testing. Having a coordinated approach with the necessary specialist's expertise is critical to making a diagnosis and initiating prompt treatment. Effective communication between interprofessional healthcare team members, including nurses, advanced clinicians, physicians, and pharmacists, is essential to enhancing patient outcomes with Lyme disease.&#x000a0;</p>
