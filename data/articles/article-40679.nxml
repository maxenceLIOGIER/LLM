        <p>Suicide is a major public health problem not only in the United States but also in many western nations. In the United States, it is the 10th leading cause of death, accounting for nearly 44,000 deaths each year. Suicide is also the seventh leading cause of years of the potential loss of life, surpassing liver disease, diabetes, and HIV. Each year, nearly half a million individuals present to the emergency rooms in the United States following an attempted suicide. Data indicate that nearly 1 out of every 7 young adults describe having some type of suicidal ideation at some point in their lives, and at least 5% have made a suicidal attempt. Suicide has repercussions way beyond the affected individual. It costs the US healthcare system over $70 billion, and untold billions of dollars are lost by the families affected in terms of loss of earnings. Suicides are at an all-time high and affect both genders. Men are nearly 3.5 times more likely than women to commit suicide, and on average, 123 people kill themselves every day. This activity presents the causes of suicide, the risk factors, the role of medications and trigger factors, and how the medical community can counter the problem.</p>

        <p>Suicide is a major public health problem not only in the United States but also in many western nations. In the&#x000a0;United States, it is the 10th leading cause of death, accounting for nearly 44,000 deaths each year. Suicide is also the seventh leading cause of lost years of potential life, surpassing liver disease, diabetes, and HIV. Each year, nearly half a million individuals present to the emergency departments in the&#x000a0;United States&#x000a0;following attempted suicide.

        <p>Suicides are at an all-time high and affect both genders. Men are nearly 3.5 times more likely than women to commit suicide, and on average, 123 people kill themselves every day.</p>
        <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has predicted that in the next 2 years, depression will be the leading cause of disability globally. Depression is not only a North American phenomenon but is now being diagnosed in almost every nation. The annual prevalence of major depressive disorders in North America is 4.5%, but this is a gross underestimate because many individuals do not seek medical help. Depression is a serious medical disorder and associated with a high risk of suicide. Data reveals that more than 90% of individuals with a major depressive disorder see a healthcare provider within the first 12 months of the episode, and at least 45% of suicide victims have had some&#x000a0;contact with a primary health care provider within the 4 weeks of suicide. This indicates that if their healthcare providers are more vigilant and alert,&#x000a0;suicide&#x000a0;is preventable in these individuals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40679.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>These grim statistics have led to a National Strategy for Suicide Prevention in the&#x000a0;United States.</p>
        <p>Considering that many individuals who commit suicide have&#x000a0;a mental health disorder and have visited their primary caregiver, the focus now is on health care providers becoming aware of the factors that increase the risk of suicide and refer these individuals to mental health professionals for some type of&#x000a0;intervention. The current United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations are that primary caregivers should screen adolescents and adults for depression only when there are appropriate systems in place to ensure adequate diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40679.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40679.r5">[5]</xref></p>

        <p>The most important thing to understand is that having just one risk factor has very limited predictive value. Millions of Americans have one of these factors at any one point in time, but very&#x000a0;few attempt suicide, and even fewer die&#x000a0;as a result. One has to look at the entire clinical picture to increase the predictive values of these risk factors.</p>

<bold>Medications and Suicides</bold>
</p>
        <p>Several medications have been linked to suicidal behavior, which has prompted the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require a black box warning on several prescription medications, including analgesics, anticonvulsants, and antidepressants.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40679.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">Antidepressants:</italic> Several studies have shown a link between antidepressant use in childhood and teenagers to self-destructive behavior. Such an association has also been reported in adults. Thus, clinicians should be very vigilant in monitoring these patients after starting therapy.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">Anticonvulsants</italic>: Reports of suicidal behavior after initiating anticonvulsant therapy have persisted for over 2 decades. Drugs like lamotrigine, gabapentin, tiagabine, and oxcarbazepine have been linked to an increased risk for self-harm or even violent death.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">Analgesics:</italic> The analgesic tramadol has also been associated with a risk of self-harm. In 2010, the FDA added a warning to the label that the drug has the potential of causing self-harm.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">Smoking cessation medications: </italic>One of the newer anti-smoking drugs, varenicline, is also known to be associated with self-injurious behaviors and is not recommended as first-line therapy for people who want to quit smoking&#x000a0;and have a history of mental illness.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">Glucocorticoids and anabolic steroids:</italic> It has been known for many years that both glucocorticoids and a number of anabolic steroids can induce rage and self-destructive behavior. Many professional wrestlers have committed suicide over the past 3 decades, and it is believed that this is because of anabolic steroid use.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">Individuals with bipolar disorder</italic> are at very high risk for suicidal behavior, especially females who had the onset of symptoms early in life. Several studies have shown that individuals with bipolar disorders have a high rate of attempted suicides. Besides the manic phase and impulsive behavior, these individuals can also develop severe depression that must also be considered a risk for suicide. Other comorbid factors that increase the risk of suicide in bipolar individuals include the presence of&#x000a0;anxiety disorder and a family history of suicide. Fortunately, many international studies have shown that lithium is known to possess anti-suicidal effects in bipolar disorder. The only problem is that lithium has a very&#x000a0;low therapeutic index, and its use has to be closely monitored. Compliance with lithium therapy is also a major issue among bipolar patients.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">Patients with schizophrenia</italic> are also at very high risk for suicide. Often these individuals experience delusions and auditory hallucinations commanding them to kill themselves. Sometimes these individuals may also become depressed because of the medications or their illness. Sometimes schizophrenia leads to severe paranoia and fear that leads one to self-harm. Finally, substance abuse, including alcohol, is common in many people with schizophrenia and may contribute to the high risk of suicide. Several studies show that the use of atypical antipsychotics in schizophrenia is associated with a decrease in suicide attempts in schizophrenia. The evidence favoring clozapine is strongest, which is,&#x000a0;in fact, the only medication approved by the FDA for preventing suicides in these patients.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">OCD and anxiety disorders:</italic>&#x000a0;Generalized anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) can generate symptoms that may make suicide possible. Individuals with phobias can develop severe symptoms like feeling scared, frightened, or terrorized. Others may feel severe panic, anxiety, or a sense of doom. Many patients with phobics often are not able to control their behavior and may become incapacitated. Studies in college students have shown an association between OCD and suicide. The risk of suicide in OCD is increased in an individual with a substance use disorder or a comorbid personality disorder. Protective factors include female gender, educated parents, and having a comorbid anxiety disorder.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">Post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD)</italic> can also increase the risk of suicide. Many of these survivors of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse suffer from nightmares and flashbacks. Veterans of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have been known to have very&#x000a0;high rates of PTSD, with many struggling to maintain normality in everyday life. These individuals have recorded extremely&#x000a0;high rates of suicides. Today, most veterans are screened for PTSD, and early adjustment to normal life is necessary to prevent the risk of self-harm.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Substance abuse is known to lead to self-destructive behavior. An individual who abuses illicit agents or prescription medications can develop depression and suicidal behavior. Others may develop depression during the withdrawal period and respond by killing themselves. The latest data from the Drug Abuse Warning Network reveals that drug-related suicide attempts have increased fourfold in the past decade, averaging about 220,000 visits to the emergency room a year. Similarly, individuals who abuse alcohol or drugs may end up losing their job, spouse, and home and may respond to this situation by committing suicide.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Even individuals in a drug recovery program are at risk for self-harm, especially those with chronic pain, those with access to a firearm and other street drugs. Many street drugs have been known to affect behavior and lead to poor psychological functioning. Suicide rates are often high in individuals who use lysergic acid diethylamide&#x000a0;(LSD) and methamphetamine.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">Dementia and delirium</italic> often lead to memory loss, delusions, hallucinations, disorientation, and poor judgment. These symptoms frequently lead to self-harm. Many dementia patients feel that&#x000a0;they have lost control of their minds and end up killing themselves.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">Traumatic brain injury</italic>&#x000a0;has been associated with an increased risk of suicide.

        <p>In the United States, the most common method of committing suicide is the use of firearms. Men are many more times likely to use a firearm compared to women. Furthermore, the risk of suicide with a firearm in men increases when the depressed individual also uses alcohol. Hence, when evaluating these individuals for suicide risk, one should determine if they own a firearm. All healthcare workers should be aware of the state statutes on possession of firearms and mental illness. Many states ban the possession of firearms by individuals with mental illness, but recent shootings in the United&#x000a0;States indicate that many mentally ill patients continue to have access to firearms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40679.r14">[14]</xref></p>

<bold>Screening for Suicide</bold>
</p>
        <p>There has been a lot of debate on the use of universal screening for depression in primary care. However, the universal feeling is that such screening should only be undertaken if there is a strong commitment to providing treatment and follow-up. There are many screening tools for suicide, and there is no one screening tool that is&#x000a0;applicable in all patients with a risk for suicide. Also, one should not always rely on the screening tool but also get to know the patient and the past mental health history.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40679.r15">[15]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40679.r16">[16]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40679.r17">[17]</xref></p>

<italic toggle="yes">Targeted Screening versus Universal Screening</italic>
</bold>
</p>
        <p>Many countries, including Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and several other European countries, have concluded that there is moderate evidence to recommend screening for depression in the primary care setting. The little evidence collected reveals that screening improves health outcomes when associated with close follow-up and treatment. However, screening alone without any follow-up is not recommended as there is inadequate evidence that&#x000a0;it helps prevent or reduce the risk of suicide. Instead of universal screening, some experts have suggested targeted screening as is done in Wales and England. For targeted screening, the following population has been identified as a risk for suicide:</p>

When initiating a screening program for suicide, it is important to have access&#x000a0;to effective treatment and follow-up. Other considerations include:</p>

          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>Because not all patients complete or refuse the initial screen, the healthcare providers must be persistent in using these screening tools. Countless reports indicate that follow-up on these patients has been universally poor. Hence, the primary care provider must ensure that the patient identified with major depression is followed up. In many cases, after the initial screen is completed and support provided, patients are never rescreened again for depression. Because depression has no cure and relapse is common, rescreening should be continued at regular intervals.</p>
        <p>The one negative about going to primary care providers for depression or any mental health disorder is that these professionals simply&#x000a0;do not have time. They often have many other patients to deal with and can barely spare more than 15 minutes at each visit. Patients with psychosocial or emotional problems usually require much longer visits, and if they feel hurried, they will not show up again.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40679.r18">[18]</xref></p>

This can be a severe burden for patients who do not have private insurance. A Canadian study revealed that many individuals who are suicidal have no symptoms or signs of depression. These people are very unlikely to seek assistance from healthcare providers, compared to people who are depressed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40679.r19">[19]</xref></p>

        <p>From an analysis of past suicide cases, it appears that&#x000a0;a number of individuals go to the emergency department or visit their primary health care provider a few weeks before committing suicide. At this visit, they rarely mention suicidal directions but may have vague physical complaints. Thus, the healthcare provider must try&#x000a0;to obtain a good mental health history beyond just the chief complaint.</p>

            <p>In-patient care is an ideal place for patients intent on committing suicide, but this is only possible for extremely&#x000a0;high-risk cases. Admitting all patients that&#x000a0;are at risk for suicide is not realistic or practical.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>If the patient is sent home, then the following additional safety measures must be established:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Help develop internal coping strategies (e.g., exercise, journaling, reading, developing a &#x000a0;hobby).</p>

        </list>
        <p>Once the individual is safe as an inpatient or outpatient, a&#x000a0;formal treatment plan should&#x000a0;be established.

Every state has laws and procedures regarding this process which must be incorporated into the clinical practice when addressing individuals at high suicide risk.</p>

<italic toggle="yes">
<bold>Pharmacologic Therapy</bold>
</italic>
</p>
        <p>If the individual has acute psychiatric symptoms like paranoia, hallucinations, extreme anxiety, or depression, pharmacological therapy may be necessary. After the patient&#x02019;s acute symptoms have been managed, the choice of further treatment depends on the specific mental illness. In most cases, psychotherapy is recommended to remove the thoughts about self-harm. However, it is important to note that despite these interventions, many patients do&#x000a0;commit suicide. Hence it is important to involve the patient&#x02019;s family, friends, and social worker in the long-term management of these patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40679.r21">[21]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40679.r22">[22]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40679.r23">[23]</xref></p>

<italic toggle="yes">
<bold>Psychotherapy</bold>
</italic>
</p>
        <p>While drug treatment is useful for managing acute symptoms like hallucinations, psychosis, or depression, psychotherapy is essential for long-term management. Cognitive behavior therapy and other related therapies like problem-solving therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, and developmental group therapy have all been used to lower the risk of suicide. A psychiatrist or psychotherapist usually administers these treatments. The problem is that these therapies require regular sessions spread over many months or even years. The other problem is the cost which can be high for those not covered by medical insurance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40679.r24">[24]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Moving Beyond Screening</bold>
</p>
        <p>Some experts suggest an alternative approach to preventing suicide other than identifying individuals at risk. The reason is that the present medical model of screening has not been shown to be effective in suicide prevention. Suicide has been strongly linked to social problems. The rates are generally&#x000a0;much higher in local communities that lack a cohesive social fabric or when individuals are left out of mainstream society. Thus, the social factors should be targeted like improving housing, providing opportunities for jobs, making it easy to access mental health care professionals and prescription medications. Unfortunately, many social factors go way beyond the ability of most primary health care providers to manage. Plus, there is also a significant cost that comes with making changes in the social structure.</p>
        <p>
<bold>What is an Effective Follow-up?</bold>
</p>
        <p>Experts say that&#x000a0;if a screening program for suicide prevention and depression is to be started, there must be effective follow-up and treatment. Once an individual has been diagnosed with depression and is at high risk for suicide, then there must be a system in place for treatments such as psychotherapy and/or antidepressant medications. If close follow-up and treatment are not available, the clinician can recommend a referral and follow-up.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Is There Evidence that Screening for Suicide Can Improve Outcomes?</bold>
</p>
        <p>Evidence shows that when the screening tools are used appropriately, there can be useful in helping healthcare workers recognize depression. When a commitment to follow-up and treatment accompanies the screening tools, better outcomes are achieved. However, screening tools are only to be used by healthcare workers committed to using the information from the screening test and providing enhanced care. The current evidence on screening for suicide risk in primary care is insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms of screening cannot be determined.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40679.r25">[25]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>At the moment, there is little evidence to support screening the population at large. In fact, in people without any psychiatric history, the role of screening remains debatable. Thus, healthcare workers are being urged to first identify patients with risk factors for suicide and those with high levels of mental stress and refer them for further evaluation. So far, each hospital or organization has its protocols for the use of suicide prevention tools. No study has ever shown that one tool is better than the other.</p>

        <p>Adolescents, adults, and older individuals who do not have an identified psychiatric disorder do not need a screen. The indication to screen depends on the presenting and past clinical history.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Risk Assessment</bold>
</p>
        <p>Since the suicide risk varies by gender, age, and race/ethnicity, some populations need careful screening, for example, older white males.</p>
        <p>Assess for presence of:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Mental health disorder</p>
          </list-item>

            <p>Chronic medical conditions&#x000a0;</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>In men, assess socioeconomic factors, such as low income, occupation, and unemployment.</p>
        <p>In older adults, additional risk factors include social isolation, spousal bereavement, neurosis, affective disorders, physical illness, and functional impairment.</p>
        <p>Risk factors of importance to military veterans include traumatic brain injury, separation from service within 12 months, posttraumatic stress disorder, and mental health conditions.</p>
        <p>It is important to understand that one single&#x000a0;risk factor has very&#x000a0;little predictive value, and hence, one should look at the entire picture. Many Americans have one risk factor for suicide at any point in their lives, but very&#x000a0;few will attempt suicide, and even fewer will die from it.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Screening Tests</bold>
</p>
        <p>The choice of screen tests is a matter of personal&#x000a0;preference because they all have a broad range of accuracy. Data on predictive values of the screening tests are limited.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Treatment</bold>
</p>
        <p>Once a patient is deemed to be&#x000a0;at risk for self-harm, referral to a mental health professional is recommended. The key treatment to reduce the risk of suicide is psychotherapy, which includes cognitive behavior therapy (e.g., dialectical behavior therapy, problem-solving therapy, and developmental group therapy).</p>

<bold>Can Screening for a Suicide Lead to Harm?</bold>
</p>
        <p>To date, there is insufficient to determine for screening for suicide leads to harm to the individual or society&#x000a0;as a whole. Presently, the USPSTF has concluded that the evidence for suicide screening in primary care/nursing is inadequate and that the balance between harm or benefit cannot be determined.</p>
        <p>The costs of screening for suicide are minimal. Except for some time and the use of questionnaires, there are no other exorbitant costs. The latest data reveals that less than 20% of primary care physicians screen adolescents or seniors for suicidal risk factors. All interprofessional healthcare team members, including clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, therapists, and auxiliary personnel, should be alert to signs of possible suicide, and those with more clinical training can initiate the screening process. This =team approach can help prevent suicide attempts. [Level 5]</p>

          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>An integrated and collaborative interprofessional team approach is necessary to identify those at the highest risk of suicide and appropriately manage their risk. The clinical nurse or psychiatry-trained nurse can assist the medical team by screening patients for suicide risk using validated screening tools. Communicating these findings with the clinicians can help patients receive appropriate medical and social support to decrease their risk. The community nurse, specialty-trained social worker, and case manager can help monitor and follow up on those identified at the highest risk of suicide to ensure they follow up with the treatment plan advised and that their needs outside of medical therapy are met. Nurses also assist the clinicians by educating the patients on suicide prevention aids and resources to seek the help they need if and when necessary. A multifaceted interprofessional team approach can reduce the number of suicide-related deaths without overburdening the current healthcare system. [Level 5]&#x000a0;</p>
