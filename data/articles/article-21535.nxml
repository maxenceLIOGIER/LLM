          <list-item>
            <p>The mental nerve is a branch of the inferior alveolar nerve from the trigeminal nerve mandibular division, exiting the mandible via the mental foramen inferior to the first premolar. Damage can be mitigated by maintaining dissection along the inferior-most aspect of the mandible. An intraoral approach can achieve direct visualization and preservation of nerves, aiding in the precise placement of rigid implants such as Medpor, which is potentially unnecessary with smaller or more flexible chin implants.</p>

        <p>Chin implantation is frequently combined with rhinoplasty to achieve a balanced nose-chin relationship and enhance the overall profile aesthetically, with indications in up to 25% of cosmetic rhinoplasty cases. Additionally, chin augmentation can significantly improve the facelift outcomes by elongating the jawline and providing a more stable framework for repositioning the soft tissues of the face.</p>

        <p>Depending on various factors such as the patient's pain threshold, anxiety level, overall health, complexity of the procedure, and surgeon's comfort and skill level, chin augmentation with an alloplastic implant may be performed under local anesthesia (with or without oral anxiolysis and analgesia) or under deeper sedation or general anesthesia.</p>
        <p>When performing procedures with local anesthesia, it is necessary to have a nurse assistant present as part of the required personnel.</p>

        <title>Preparation</title>
        <p>A thorough assessment of the chin should encompass evaluation in 3 dimensions&#x02014;vertical (superior-inferior), horizontal (anterior-posterior), and transverse dimensions. In addition, the chin's position relative to the soft tissues of the lips, teeth, maxilla, nose, and neck should be considered. While photographic analysis suffices for minor deformities necessitating an alloplastic implant, more significant deformities, such as vertical height excess or transverse asymmetry, may require radiographic evaluation.</p>
        <p>Several techniques exist to help evaluate patients who may benefit from a&#x000a0;chin augmentation:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>In Goode's method, a line perpendicular to the Frankfort horizontal line passes through the alar groove. According to this approach, the pogonion (the most prominent or anterior point of chin projection) should align with this line or be situated immediately posterior to it.</p>

        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Gonzalez-Ulloa proposed a line that runs perpendicular to the Frankfort horizontal line and passes through the nasion (the deepest portion of radix). According to this method, the pogonion should either intersect with this line or be situated immediately posterior to it. Furthermore, he classified the degree of insufficiency into 3 grades&#x02014;grade I if within 1 cm posterior to this line, grade II between 1 and&#x000a0;2 cm posterior, and grade III if greater than 2 cm posterior.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Silver proposed a line perpendicular to the Frankfort horizontal line, crossing through the mucocutaneous junction of the lower lip. According to his suggestion, the pogonion should align with this line or, ideally for women, be within 2 mm posterior to it.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Merrifield adopted a similar yet slightly different method for chin analysis by introducing the Z-angle. This angle is formed by the Frankfort horizontal line and a line extending from the pogonion to the most anterior projection point of the lips. Ideally, the Z-angle should fall within the range of 75&#x000b0; to 85&#x000b0;.</p>

            <p>Legan introduced an angle-based approach for chin analysis, consisting of a line from the glabella to the subnasal point and another from the subnasal point to the pogonion. The ideal value for this angle is 12&#x000b0;, with an acceptable range between 8&#x000b0;&#x000a0;and 16.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21535.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21535.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21535.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21535.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21535.r8">[8]</xref></p>

        <p>Finally, for comprehensive chin analysis, the cervicomental angle (CMA) and the mentocervical angle (MCA) are crucial facial angles to consider.</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>The CMA is formed by a tangential line from the submental point and another tangential line to the neck at the subcervical intersection or the lowest point between the submental area and the neck. Ideally, the CMA measures 121&#x000ba; for men and 126&#x000ba; for women.</p>

        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>The MCA is commonly defined as the angle between a line passing through the nasal tip and pogonion and a tangential line through the submental point, with an ideal angle ranging from 110&#x000ba; to 120&#x000ba;.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21535.r9">[9]</xref></p>

        <p>Although these methods provide valuable insight into achieving an ideal chin position concerning the lips, face, and neck, only a few account for the crucial relationship between the nose and chin. This relationship is vital to acknowledge, as they directly influence each other's relative appearance in space. As a general rule, a more projected nose tends to make the chin appear less projected, and vice versa. An essential and ideal harmonious balance exists between the projection of the chin and the nose.&#x000a0;Notably, all the mentioned analysis methods rely on standardized photography techniques, with four of them utilizing the Frankfort horizontal line&#x02014;a well-established anatomical reference extending from the superior border of the external auditory canal to the inferior orbital rim.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21535.r5">[5]</xref> Furthermore, radiographic evaluation, including panoramic radiographs and/or lateral and anterior-posterior (AP) radiographs, may be beneficial for addressing more complex deformities such as vertical height excess, orthognathic abnormalities, and transverse asymmetry, commonly observed in conditions such as hemifacial/craniofacial microsomia, oculoauricular vertebral (OAV) syndrome, or isolated anatomical components.</p>

        <title>Technique or Treatment</title>
        <p>Once the patient qualifies for an alloplastic implant and the appropriate type and size are determined, the decision to perform the procedure via an intraoral or submental approach is considered. The transoral approach presents the advantage of avoiding external scarring, but it involves greater technical complexity and carries a higher risk of infection due to communication with the oral cavity. Conversely, the submental approach may be preferred for its improved exposure during placement and access to the neck for additional procedures such as facelift, neck lift, platysmaplasty, or liposuction. Moreover, this approach mitigates the risk of implant contamination by oral secretions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21535.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21535.r10">[10]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21535.r11">[11]</xref></p>

            <p>Subperiosteal dissection is conducted using a periosteal elevator, such as a Freer, Joseph, or #9, proceeding laterally along the inferior border of the mandible. The dissection should cover no more than 10% of the implant's size and extend for the length of the implant wings, typically around 5 cm in most implants. Notably, it is crucial to avoid extending the pocket more than 1 cm superiorly to maintain a tight pocket, prevent damage to the mental nerve, and minimize the risk of implant migration to an undesired, superior position.&#x000a0;</p>

            <p>When opting for an intraoral approach, a gingivolabial incision of 2 to 3 cm is made, followed by a similar dissection through the mentalis muscle down to the periosteum. The implant is then placed in a supraperiosteal plane centrally, while the lateral wings are positioned sub-periosteally. Maintaining dissection along the inferior aspect of the mandible helps minimize the risk of mental nerve injury. Following this, the wound is thoroughly irrigated with antibiotic solution, and layers of closure are performed using absorbable sutures, ensuring meticulous approximation of the mentalis and creating a water-tight seal.</p>

        <p>An alloplastic chin implant is used to augment&#x000a0;chin projection and improve facial aesthetics. The implant&#x000a0;can effectively adjust chin projection and/or width to achieve a balanced nose-chin relationship or enhance the pre-jowl area, resulting in a more pleasing appearance. However, successful implementation of an alloplastic chin implant relies on a thorough understanding of facial anatomy and precise surgical techniques to achieve optimal outcomes.</p>

        <p>Before conducting an alloplastic chin augmentation procedure, conducting a comprehensive preoperative assessment and identifying any patient-specific risk factors is crucial. Adopting a team approach is optimal to uphold the procedure's standards. The following evaluations are recommended before surgery:</p>

        </list>
        <p>For optimal outcomes, an interprofessional team of healthcare providers with expertise&#x000a0;in chin implantation, including surgeons, anesthesiologists, surgical assistants, and operating room nurses, should perform alloplastic chin implantation. In addition, it is strongly recommended that a dedicated nursing staff be employed for patient monitoring, particularly when sedation is administered in a clinical setting. Close postoperative follow-up appointments should be scheduled to monitor for signs of infection, hematoma, or rejection. Patient education&#x000a0;is crucial in preventing complications after surgery, as they should be advised to avoid&#x000a0;strenuous activities, heavy lifting, or bending over during the initial week after the surgery. By adhering to these fundamental measures, favorable outcomes can be expected when performing alloplastic chin implantation.</p>

        <p>Recovery typically spans 3 to 5 days for most individuals after chin augmentation surgery. However, swelling and bruising may persist for up to 2 weeks, varying based on factors such as the size of the implant and individual patient characteristics. Pain levels are generally mild to moderate and can be managed with over-the-counter analgesics such as acetaminophen (1000 mg every 8 hours as needed), supplemented with prescription-strength medication if required.</p>
        <p>Postoperative antibiotics, covering oral flora, are advised for 5 to 7 days, especially with a transoral approach. Patients are advised to consume a soft diet, avoid biting with the front teeth, maintain head elevation, regularly apply ice to the area, practice good oral hygiene with saltwater rinses, and refrain from strenuous activities for 2 weeks. Follow-up appointments are scheduled around 7 days after surgery for wound assessment and suture removal, with photographic documentation typically done during the 3-month visit.</p>

        <p>Regardless of the procedure's location (clinic, hospital, or surgery center), having a dedicated recovery nurse is strongly recommended to monitor the patient closely and promptly detect any severe complications, such as hematoma formation. Additionally, scheduling a close follow-up appointment within 1 week postoperatively in the clinic is essential to monitor for signs of infection, hematoma, or rejection.</p>
