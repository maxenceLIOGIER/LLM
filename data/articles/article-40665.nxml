        <p>Family and domestic violence, including child abuse, intimate partner abuse, and elder abuse, is a national public health problem. Domestic violence in Kentucky falls under the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services and the Division of Protection and Permanency, which has recommended standards to precisely measure the extent of domestic violence and develop strategies for education and increasing public awareness. Kentucky has several domestic violence centers that will provide referral services, counseling, a 24-hour hotline, emergency shelter, educational services, assessment and referral of parents with children, and local training of law enforcement personnel. This activity reviews evaluation and management strategies for Kentucky victims of domestic abuse and stresses the role of team-based interprofessional care for these victims.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Family and domestic violence (including child abuse, intimate partner abuse, and elder abuse) is a common problem in the United States and Kentucky. Family and domestic health violence are estimated to affect 10 million people in the United States every year. It is a national public health problem, and virtually all healthcare professionals will, at some point, evaluate or treat a patient who is a victim of some form of domestic or family violence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40665.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40665.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40665.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>Unfortunately, each form of family violence begets interrelated forms of violence. The "cycle of abuse" is often continued from exposed children into their adult relationships and finally&#x000a0;to the care of the elderly.</p>
        <p>Domestic and family violence includes a range of abuse including economic, physical, sexual, emotional, and psychological toward children, adults, and elders.</p>
        <p>Intimate partner violence includes&#x000a0;stalking,&#x000a0;sexual and physical violence, and psychological aggression by a current or former partner. In the United States, as many as&#x000a0;one in four women and one in nine men are domestic violence victims. Domestic violence is thought to be underreported. Domestic violence affects the victim, families, co-workers, and community. It causes&#x000a0;diminished psychological and physical health, decreases the quality of life, and results in decreased productivity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40665.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40665.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40665.r6">[6]</xref></p>
        <p>The national economic cost of domestic and family violence is estimated to be over 12 billion dollars per year. The number of individuals affected is expected to rise over the next 20 years, with the biggest increase in the elderly population.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Definitions</bold>
</p>
        <p>Family and domestic violence are abusive behaviors in which one individual gains power over another individual.</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Intimate partner violence typically includes sexual or physical violence, psychological aggression, and stalking. This may include former or current intimate partners.</p>
          </list-item>

<bold>Center for Disease Control and Prevention</bold>
</p>
        <p>Domestic violence, spousal abuse, battering, or intimate partner violence, is typically the victimization of an individual with whom the abuser has an intimate or romantic relationship. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines domestic as "physical violence, sexual violence, stalking, and psychological aggression (including coercive acts) by a current or former intimate partner."</p>
        <p>Domestic and family violence has no boundaries. It occurs in intimate relationships regardless of culture, race, religion, or socioeconomic status. All healthcare professionals must&#x000a0;understand that domestic violence, whether in the form of emotional, psychological, sexual, or physical violence, is common in our society and should develop the ability to recognize it and make the appropriate&#x000a0;referral.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Kentucky</bold>
</p>
        <p>
<bold>KY Cabinet for Health and Family Services</bold>
</p>
        <p>Domestic violence&#x000a0;in Kentucky falls under the&#x000a0;Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services&#x000a0;and the Division of Protection and Permanency.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Statutes</bold>
</p>
        <p>Domestic violence under&#x000a0;KRS 403.715 to 403.785&#x000a0;is defined as "physical injury, serious physical injury, sexual abuse, assault, or the infliction of fear of imminent physical injury, serious physical injury, sexual abuse, or assault between family members or members of an unmarried couple."</p>
        <p>
<bold>Violence Abuse Types</bold>
</p>
        <p>The types of&#x000a0;violence include stalking, economic, emotional or psychological, sexual, neglect, physical, and Munchausen syndrome by proxy&#x000a0;(aka factitious disorder imposed on another or FDIA). Domestic and family violence occurs in all races, ages, and sexes. It knows no cultural, socioeconomic, educational, religious, or geographic limitation. It may occur in individuals with different sexual orientations.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Stalking</bold>
</p>
        <p>Stalking is defined as repeated, unwanted attention that causes fear or concern for safety. This includes unwanted letters, emails, texts, or phone calls; watching, following, or spying; showing up repeatedly in the same place as the victim; damaging the victim&#x02019;s property; making threats of harm.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Economic</bold>
</p>
        <p>Financial abuse occurs when an individual is forced to become dependent through the improper use of money by a person in a trusting relationship. The abuser may also forbid employment or education to gain additional financial control. Examples include coercion to surrender, forgery, theft of possessions, and improper use of guardianship or power of attorney.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Emotional or Psychological</bold>
</p>
        <p>Emotional or psychologic domestic violence includes verbal and non-verbal communication, which inflicts emotional or mental harm. Emotional or psychologic violence may be subtle, but it is often very harmful to the victim, resulting in depression and suicide.</p>
        <p>Emotional or physical abuse may involve convincing the victim that the violence is their fault, there is no way out of their situation, and the victim is worthless and needs the abuser to exist. Many abusers will isolate their victims from friends, family, school, and work.</p>
        <p>Examples</p>

            <p>Threats: Use of gestures, words, or weapons that future harm may occur</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>
<bold>Sexual</bold>
</p>
        <p>Sexual violence is using physical coercion to force participation in unwanted sex acts. Perpetrators often incapacitate victims with alcohol or drugs. Some victims may be nursing home patients with mental disabilities or dementia.</p>
        <p>Categories</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Forced anal, oral, or vaginal penetration of a victim</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Forced penetration of someone else</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Sexual coercion involving intimidation to pressure consent</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Unwanted exposure to pornography, harassment, sexual violence, filming, taking, or disseminating sexual photograph or video</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Unwanted sexual contact</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p><bold>Neglect</bold>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Neglect occurs when a child or elder's well-being is ignored by an individual responsible for that well-being. Neglect is defined as a failure to provide for a dependent&#x02019;s emotional, physical, or social needs, including hygiene, nutrition, clothing, shelter, and access to health care. The dependent is placed in a harmful situation. Abandonment is also a form of neglect.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Munchausen by Proxy</bold>
</p>
        <p>Munchausen syndrome by proxy is a factitious disorder where an individual fabricates or exaggerates mental or physical health problems in the person for whom he or she cares. The primary motive is to gain attention or sympathy. Unlike Munchausen syndrome, the deception involves not themselves, but someone under the person's care.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Physical</bold>
<bold/>
</p>
        <p>The use of physical power resulting in injury, disability, or death&#x000a0;is physical violence. Other forms of physical violence include coercion, administering drugs or alcohol without permission, and denying medical care.</p>
        <p>
<bold>The Cycle of Abuse and Violence</bold>
</p>
        <p>Usually, abuse begins with verbal threats that escalate to physical violence. Violent events are often unpredictable, and the triggers are unclear to the victims. The victims live in constant fear of the next violent attack. Violence and abuse are perpetrated in an endless cycle involving three phases: tension-building, explosive, and honeymoon.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-40665.s3" sec-type="Etiology">
        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>Domestic and family violence, including child abuse, intimate partner violence, and elder abuse, often starts when one partner, parent, or caretaker feels the need to dominate or control. Abuse begins with emotional or verbal threats and may escalate to physical violence. Victims live in a constant state of fear. The perpetrator often becomes explosively violent. After the violent event, the perpetrator may apologize. This&#x000a0;cycle of violence usually repeats.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40665.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40665.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40665.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40665.r9">[9]</xref></p>

<bold>Risk Factors</bold>
</p>
        <p>Risk factors for domestic and family violence include individual, relationship, community, and societal issues. There is an inverse relationship between education and domestic violence. The less education, the more likely domestic violence will occur. Childhood abuse is commonly associated with becoming a perpetrator of domestic violence as an adult. Perpetrators of domestic violence commonly repeat acts of violence with new partners. Drug and alcohol abuse greatly&#x000a0;increases the incidence of domestic violence.</p>
        <p>Children who are victims or witness domestic and family violence may believe that&#x000a0;violence is a reasonable way to resolve a conflict. Males who learn that females are not equally respected are more likely to abuse females in adulthood. Females who witness domestic violence as children are more likely to be victimized by their spouses. While females are often the victim of domestic violence, gender roles can be reversed. Common risk factors include:</p>

            <p>The use and abuse of alcohol and drugs are strongly associated with a high probability of violence. Alcohol abuse is known to be a strong predictor of acute injury. Approximately half of the domestic violence victims indicate their partner was intoxicated at the time of the assault.</p>

        <p>Domination may include emotional, physical, or sexual abuse&#x000a0;potentially caused by an interaction of situational and individual factors. This means the abuser learns violent behavior from their family, community, or culture. They see violence and are victims of violence.</p>
        <p>No matter the underlying circumstances, nothing justifies domestic and family violence. Understanding the causes assists us in understanding the behavior of an abuser. The abuser must be separated from the potential victim and treated for destructive behavior before a major&#x000a0;event negatively impacts the lives of all involved.</p>

        <p>Domestic violence is a serious and challenging public health problem. Approximately 1 in 3 women and one in 10&#x000a0;men 18 years of age or older experience domestic violence. Annually, domestic violence is responsible for over 1500 deaths in the United States and as many as&#x000a0;200 deaths in Florida. In Florida, more than one in three women&#x000a0;and one in four&#x000a0;men experience physical violence, stalking, or rape.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40665.r10">[10]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40665.r11">[11]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40665.r12">[12]</xref></p>
        <p>Domestic violence victims typically experience severe physical injuries requiring care at a hospital or clinic. The cost to individuals and society is significant. The national annual cost of medical and mental health care services related to acute domestic violence is estimated at over $8 billion. If the injury results in a long-term or chronic condition, the cost is considerably higher.</p>
        <p>Financial hardship and unemployment are contributors to domestic violence. An economic downturn is associated with increased calls to the National Domestic Violence Hotline.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, the national rate of nonfatal domestic violence is declining. This is thought to be due to a decline in the marriage rate, decreased domesticity, better access to domestic violence shelters, improvements in female economic status, and an increase in the average age of the population.</p>

</p>
        <p>In Kentucky, a state task force (The Division of Protection and Permanency)&#x000a0;has recommended standards to precisely measure the extent of domestic violence and develop strategies for education and increasing public awareness. The results include:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>The legislation now involves professional (rather than the former "universal") mandatory reporting law. This requires reporting by a physician, osteopath, coroner, medical examiner, medical resident, medical intern, chiropractor, nurse, dentist, optometrist, EMT, paramedic, licensed mental health professional, therapist, Cabinet employee, child care personnel, teacher, school personnel, ordained minister, victim advocate, or any agency employing these individuals.</p>

            <p>Kentucky is one of three states (with Oklahoma and Arkansas) with a mandatory reporting law specific to domestic violence.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>Domestic violence offenses result in approximately&#x000a0;40 deaths in&#x000a0;Kentucky annually. The perpetrators are usually male, and victims usually female. Two-thirds of the victims lived with the perpetrators of domestic violence in one analysis of Kentucky occurrences. One in 4 had some form of domestic violence report prior to the homicide.&#x000a0; As stated in a Domestic Violence Fatality Review (https://ag.ky.gov/pdf_news/DVFR%20book.pdf), Kentucky "has no formal statewide surveillance system to track intimate partner violence-related homicides and no statewide formal procedure to review intimate partner-related homicide cases."</p>
        <p>Age, family income, and ethnicity are all risk factors for both sexual abuse and physical abuse. Gender is a risk factor for sexual abuse but not for physical abuse.<bold/></p>
        <p>
<bold>Race</bold>
</p>
        <p>Maltreatment of children is found in every race, culture, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Gender</bold>
</p>
        <p>The genders are equally affected, but homicide rates are&#x000a0;somewhat higher in males.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Morbidity and Mortality</bold>
</p>
        <p>Children may experience pain, humiliation, fear, loss of self-esteem, and injury. Physical damage may range from minor injury to disfigurement to brain trauma and even death. Long-term health consequences and adverse experiences may increase anxiety, depression, substance abuse, self-mutilation, suicides, criminal behavior, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, premature mortality, low well-being, obesity, and chronic mental health problems.</p>
        <p>Mortality increases with multiple episodes of trauma. Homicide is a leading cause of death in aged children 1 to 4 years, and over 80% of fatalities from child abuse are in children younger than 4.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Intimate Partner Violence</bold>
</p>
        <p>According to the CDC, 1 in 4&#x000a0;women and 1 in 7&#x000a0;men will experience physical violence by their intimate partner at some point&#x000a0;during their lifetimes. About 1 in 3&#x000a0;women and nearly 1 in 6 men experience some form of sexual violence during their lifetimes. Intimate partner violence, sexual violence, and stalking are high, with intimate partner violence occurring in over 10 million people each year.</p>
        <p>One in 6&#x000a0;women and 1 in 19 men have experienced stalking during their lifetimes. The majority are stalked by someone they know. An intimate partner stalks about 6 in 10 female victims and 4 in 10 male victims.</p>
        <p>At least 5 million acts of domestic violence occur annually to women aged 18 years and older, with over 3 million involving men. While most events are minor, for example, grabbing, shoving, pushing, slapping, and hitting, serious and sometimes fatal injuries do&#x000a0;occur. Approximately 1.5 million intimate partner female rapes and physical assaults are perpetrated annually, and approximately 800,000 male assaults occur. About 1 in 5 women have experienced completed or attempted rape at some point&#x000a0;in their lives. About 1% to 2% of men have experienced completed or attempted rape.</p>
        <p>The incidence of intimate partner violence has declined by over 60%, from about 10&#x000a0;victimizations per 1000 persons age 12 or older to approximately four per 1000.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Race</bold>
</p>
        <p>African American, American Indian, Alaskan Native women and men, and Hispanic women report higher domestic violence rates. Asian and Pacific Island women and men report lower rates of intimate partner violence. However, differences among groups tend to&#x000a0;diminish when sociodemographic and relationship variables are controlled.</p>
        <p>The spousal homicide rate among African Americans is significantly higher than for Whites. The incidence of homicide between partners is higher in interracial marriages when compared with intraracial marriages.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Gender</bold>
</p>
        <p>Women are more likely to be attacked, injured, or raped by their partners than by any other person. According to the United States Department of Justice, women are 6 times more likely than men to experience violence committed by a spouse or ex-spouse, boyfriend or girlfriend, ex-boyfriend, or ex-girlfriend. Of all violence against women committed by a single offender, an intimate partner is a perpetrator in approximately one-third of cases.</p>
        <p>Lesbians report higher levels of sexual violence, in the range of 30% to 40%. There is some&#x000a0;evidence that homosexual males also experience higher levels of sexual violence.</p>
        <p>Approximately 10% of women who live with intimate female partners report being raped, physically assaulted, or stalked by their cohabitant. One-third of women living with a male partner reported victimization by their male cohabitant.</p>
        <p>Approximately 15% of men living with a male intimate partner report being raped, physically assaulted, or stalked by their cohabitant. In comparison, less than 10% of men who have lived with a female partner experience similar problems.</p>
        <p>More than half of all homeless women and families are fleeing domestic violence.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Age</bold>
</p>
        <p>Women aged 16 to 24 years are more likely to be victims of violence at the hands of an intimate partner. Twenty to 30% of women who attend college report violence during a date.</p>
        <p>Rates of spousal homicide peak in the 15 to 24-year-old age category. Rates decline with age in African Americans but not in whites.</p>
        <p>As the age difference between males and females increases, so does the risk of spouse homicide.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Mortality and Morbidity</bold>
</p>
        <p>Approximately 2 million injuries and deaths occur each year as a result of domestic violence. About one-third of domestic violence patients will seek care in an emergency department. Injuries include over 40,000 gunshot wounds, stab wounds, fractures, internal injuries, and loss of consciousness; over 50,000 injured as a result of intimate partner sexual assault; and approximately 400,000 with soft tissue trauma.</p>

<bold>Elder</bold>
</p>
        <p>Due to underreporting and difficulty sampling, obtaining accurate incidence information on elder abuse and neglect is difficult. Elder abuse is thought to occur in three to 10% of the population of elders.</p>
        <p>Edler patients may not report due to fear, guilt, ignorance, or shame. Clinicians underreport elder abuse due to poor recognition of the problem, lack of understanding of reporting methods and requirements, and concerns about physician-patient confidentiality.</p>
        <p>The elderly may be unable to respond to a survey, not speak English, or have dementia, leading to&#x000a0;inaccurate reports on the number of abused older persons. While obtaining the exact frequency of elder abuse is difficult, it will commonly be encountered in clinical practice. All healthcare providers must maintain a high index of suspicion.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Gender</bold>
</p>
        <p>Women are more commonly victims of intimate partner abuse. It is thought they report abuse at higher rates or because the severity of injuries is usually greater than in males. Some studies have found little or no differences based on gender.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Age</bold>
</p>
        <p>There is no universally accepted definition of when old age begins. As a result, statistics on elder abuse are highly variable. Typically, 60 or 65 years of age is the cutoff for being considered elderly.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Race</bold>
</p>
        <p>All racial, socioeconomic, and religious backgrounds are affected by elder abuse.</p>
        <p>The estimated racial and ethnic distribution in older persons abused is on average:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>White: 60%</p>

        </list>
        <p>
<bold>Mortality and Morbidity</bold>
</p>
        <p>In the elderly population, victims of physical abuse and neglect have a much higher mortality rate than those who were never reported as abused. Early detection of elder abuse cases results in decreased morbidity and mortality. Healthcare provider involvement is important as only 1 in 6 victims will self-report mistreatment to the appropriate legal authorities.</p>

        </list>
        <p>Elder domestic violence may be financial or physical. The elderly may be controlled&#x000a0;financially. Elders are often hesitant to report this abuse if it is their only available caregiver. Victims are often dependent, infirm, isolated, or mentally impaired. Healthcare professionals should be aware of the high incidence of abuse in this population.</p>
        <p>Because elder abuse is common, healthcare professionals must remain aware of the potential for abuse. When abuse occurs between elder partners, it is usually part of a long-standing pattern of marital violence or as abuse developing in old age. In the latter case, abuse may be precipitated by issues related to dementia, disability, and changing family relationships.</p>
        <p>Some states have a very high percentage of older residents and a concomitant higher percentage of elderly victims of domestic violence.</p>

<bold>Intimate Partner Abuse: Same-Sex</bold>
</p>
        <p>Same-sex partner abuse is common and may be difficult to identify. Over 35% of heterosexual women, 40% of lesbians, 60% of bisexual women experience domestic violence. For men, the incidence is slightly lower. In addition to common findings of abuse, perpetrators may try to control their partners by threatening to make their sexual preferences public.</p>
        <p>The provider should be aware there are fewer resources available to help individuals that are victims; further, the perpetrator and victim may have the same friends or support groups.</p>

        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>Domestic violence may be difficult to uncover when the victim is frightened, especially when they present to an emergency department or healthcare practitioner's office. The key is to establish an assessment protocol and maintain an awareness of the possibility that domestic and family violence may be the cause of the patient&#x02019;s signs and symptoms. Screening should be carried out in primary care, obstetric and gynecologic, psychiatric, pediatric, urgent care, and emergency departments.</p>
        <p>Establishing that injuries are related to domestic abuse is a challenging task. Life and limb-threatening injuries are priorities. After stabilization and physical evaluation, laboratory tests, X-rays, CT, or MRI may be indicated. It is important that healthcare professionals first attend to the underlying issue that brought the victim to the emergency department.</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>The evaluation should start with a detailed history and physical examination. Clinicians should screen all females for domestic violence and refer females who screen positive. This includes females who do not have signs or symptoms of abuse. All healthcare facilities should have a plan in place that provides for assessing, screening, and referring patients for intimate partner violence. Protocols should include referral, documentation, and follow-up.</p>

          <list-item>

        <p>Assuming the patient is stable and not in pain, a detailed assessment of victims should occur after the disclosure of abuse. Assessing safety is a priority. A list of standard prepared questions can help alleviate the uncertainty in the patient's evaluation. If there are signs of immediate danger, refer to advocate support, shelter, a hotline for victims, or legal authorities.</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>If there is no immediate danger, the assessment should focus on mental and physical health and establish a history of current or past abuse. These responses determine the appropriate&#x000a0;intervention.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>During the initial assessment, a practitioner must be sensitive to the patient&#x02019;s cultural beliefs. Incorporating a cultural sensitivity assessment with a history of domestic violence victims may allow more effective treatment.</p>

          <list-item>
            <p>Patients that have suffered domestic violence may or may not want a referral. Many are fearful of their lives and financial well-being. Hence, they may be&#x000a0;weighing the tradeoff in leaving the abuser&#x000a0;leading to loss of support and perhaps the responsibility of caring for children alone. The healthcare provider needs to assure the patient that the decision is&#x000a0;voluntary and that the provider will help regardless of the decision. The goal is to make resources accessible, safe, secure, and to enhance support.</p>

        <p>Imaging</p>
        <p>The evaluation of the pediatric skeleton can prove challenging for a non-specialist as there are subtle differences from adults such as cranial sutures and incomplete bone growth. A fracture can be misinterpreted. If there is a concern for abuse, consider consulting a radiologist.</p>
        <p>Imaging: Skeletal Survey</p>
        <p>A skeletal survey is indicated in children younger than 2 years with suspected physical abuse. The incidence of occult fractures is as high as 1 in 4 in physically abused children younger than 2 years. The clinician should consider screening&#x000a0;all siblings younger than 2 years.</p>
        <p>The skeletal survey should include two views of each extremity; anteroposterior and lateral skull; and lateral chest, spine, abdomen, pelvis, hands, and feet. A radiologist should review the films for classic metaphyseal lesions and healing fractures, most often involving the posterior ribs. A &#x0201c;babygram&#x0201d; that includes only one film of the entire body is not an adequate skeletal survey.</p>
        <p>Skeletal fractures will remodel at different rates, depending on the patient's age, location, and nutritional status.</p>

        <p>Imaging: CT</p>
        <p>Three-dimensional reconstruction CT imaging is more specific in detecting skull and rib fractures but involves greater radiation exposure.</p>
        <p>If abuse or head trauma is suspected, a CT scan of the head should be performed on all children aged 6 months or younger or children younger than 24 months if intracranial trauma is suspected. Clinicians should have a low threshold to obtain a CT scan of the head when abuse is suspected, especially in an infant younger than 12 months.</p>
        <p>An&#x000a0;intravenous-contrast&#x000a0;CT of the abdomen and pelvis is indicated in unconscious children; who have traumatic abdominal findings such as abrasions, bruises, tenderness, absent or decreased bowel sounds; abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting; or have elevated&#x000a0;AST, an ALT greater than 80 IU/L, or lipase greater than 100 IU/L.</p>

<bold>Evidence Collection</bold>
</p>
        <p>Domestic and family violence commonly results in the legal prosecution of the perpetrator.&#x000a0;Preferably, a team specializing in domestic violence is called in to assist with evidence collection.</p>
        <p>Each health facility should have a written procedure for packaging and labeling specimens and maintaining a chain of custody. Law enforcement personnel will often assist with evidence collection and provide specific kits.</p>
        <p>It is important to avoid destroying evidence. Evidence includes tissue specimens, blood, urine, saliva, and vaginal and rectal specimens. Saliva from bites can be collected; the bite mark is swabbed with a water-moistened cotton-tipped swab.</p>
        <p>Clothing stained with blood, saliva, semen, and vomit should be retained for forensic analysis.</p>

            <p>The physical examination is still the most significant diagnostic tool to detect abuse. A child or adult with suspected abuse should be undressed, and a comprehensive physical exam should be performed. The skin should be examined for bruises, bites, burns, and injuries in different stages of healing. Examine for retinal hemorrhages, subdural hemorrhages, tympanic membrane rupture, soft tissue swelling, oral bruising, fractured teeth, and organ injury.</p>

<bold>Screening: Child Abuse</bold>
</p>
        <p>Child abuse and neglect may result in acute trauma, anxiety, depression, unwanted pregnancy, substance abuse, suicide, and risky behaviors. Children are more likely to be involved in family and intimate partner abuse.</p>
        <p>The most common risk factors for child abuse and neglect are poverty, low education, large family size, single-parent, young parents, step-parents in the home, and psychiatric disease.</p>
        <p>Clinicians must take responsibility to identify child abuse to prevent recurrent injuries. While it has not been established that routine child abuse screening is necessary, clinicians should screen for abuse if it is suspected. Multiple missed appointments and delays in seeking medical treatment are indicators of neglect.</p>
        <p>Many organizations offer free screening tools. However, most lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity. False-positive and false-negative results can entail serious consequences, including both under- and overreporting of abuse.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Screening: Intimate Partner Violence</bold>
</p>
        <p>Some experts believe screening should only occur when signs and symptoms are present. Routine screening may, in fact, be problematic because it can stigmatize patients and result in anxiety. Further, in domestic violence cases, victims are often unwilling to use available&#x000a0;resources to end&#x000a0;abuse.</p>
        <p>Several national organizations, such as the American Medical Association and Family Violence Prevention Fund, recommend screening all women for intimate partner violence. Screening tools for abuse are available for assessment, intervention, documentation, and referral.</p>
        <p>Studies have shown that abused women who receive counseling have fewer instances of intimate partner violence during and after pregnancy.</p>
        <p>Screening has the potential to decrease abuse and improve health outcomes. While victims may not be willing to use the information provided, serious consequences&#x000a0;follow if abuse is ignored. A clinician can provide the resources to ensure that the patient is educated and informed.</p>
        <p>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides numerous tools to assist practitioners in the free publication,&#x000a0;Intimate Partner Violence and Sexual Violence Victimization Assessment Instruments for Use in Healthcare Settings.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Screening: Elder Abuse</bold>
</p>
        <p>Elderly patients are at risk of abuse in the home environment as well as in institutional settings. Risk factors for elder abuse both at home and in institutions include increased age, dementia, abnormal behaviors, cognitive decline, physical dependency, and daily living activities impairment. In an institutional setting, there may be shortages of qualified assistants, nurses' aides, and other support staff become tired, stressed, and overwhelmed, resulting in anger and aggression that may be taken out on patients.</p>
        <p>Screening for elder abuse should include a review of social and financial information.</p>
        <p>The Abuse Suspicion Index is a screening tool for cognitively intact patients. In patients with dementia, often, the practitioner must rely on the physical exam. Bruising can be an indicator of physical; however, elders commonly take blood-thinning agents that result in easy bruising. Victims of physical abuse tend to&#x000a0;have bruises that are larger than five centimeters, and they tend to be located on the face, lateral right arm, or posterior torso. In many instances, the victim may recall how the bruise occurred.</p>
        <p>If abuse is suspected, radiographs of ribs, small bones, and face should be considered.&#x000a0;A CT&#x000a0;of the head should also be considered to rule out subdural hemorrhage. While difficult, a pelvic examination should be considered if there are any signs of sexual abuse. Weight loss may be a sign of physical or medical neglect due to malnutrition. Other common causes of weight loss should be ruled out. Pressure ulcers should raise suspicion for neglect.</p>
        <p>All clinicians should&#x000a0;be aware of the potential signs and symptoms of elder abuse and be familiar with screening tools. When abuse is suspected, the history and physical exam should be carefully conducted and documented with additional laboratory and imaging tests considered.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Screening: Challenges</bold>
</p>
        <p>While screening is crucial to identify domestic and family, several barriers exist. Despite the prevalence of domestic violence, many clinicians do&#x000a0;take the time to screen patients. Unfortunately,&#x000a0;no&#x000a0;universal approach has been established to assess for domestic violence. Additionally, many clinicians do not have the time, resources, or desire&#x000a0;to get involved with abuse or neglect investigation. Many health professionals remain ignorant&#x000a0;of the warning signs and risk factors. In most states, reporting of suspected elder abuse or neglect is required by statute. However, few health professionals are prosecuted for failure to comply, further hindering reporting.&#x000a0;Routine screening increases the odds of identifying domestic abuse cases.</p>
        <p>Ongoing challenges include:</p>

<bold>Reporting</bold>
</p>
        <p>In cases of acute injury or emergency, contact local law enforcement.</p>
        <p>A 24-hour toll-free domestic violence hotline is available for counseling and information at 1-800-656-HOPE. The counselors will refer the victim to a local domestic violence center. The&#x000a0;Adult Abuse Hot Line is (Toll-Free)&#x000a0;1-800-752-6200 or 1-877-597-2331</p>
        <p>Kentucky has several domestic violence centers that will provide referral services, counseling, a 24-hour hotline, emergency shelter, educational services, assessment and referral of parents with children, and local training of law enforcement personnel.</p>
        <p>If child abuse is suspected, contact the KY Cabinet for Health and Family Services or National Child Abuse Hotline: 1-800-4-A-Child.</p>
        <p>Healthcare professionals play a crucial role in screening, identifying, and reporting child abuse. Using screening tools in clinical practice can increase the odds that child abuse will be identified.</p>

        <p>Federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA)</p>
        <p>Each state has specific child abuse statues. Federal legislation provides guidelines for defining acts that constitute child abuse. The guidelines suggest that child abuse includes an act or failure recent act that presents an imminent risk of serious harm.

</p>
        <p>According to Kentucky law, Primary care physicians, who are granted licensure after July 1, 1996, are required to successfully complete a 3-hour domestic violence training course within 3 years of the date of initial licensure.</p>
        <p>Kentucky Statute 600.020: Abused or neglected child "means a child whose health or welfare is harmed or threatened with harm when his parent, guardian, or other person exercising custodial control or supervision of the child."</p>
        <p>Kentucky Statute 620.030: "Any person who knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a child is dependent, neglected or abused shall immediately cause an oral or written report to be made to a local law enforcement agency or the Kentucky State Police; the Cabinet or its designated representative; the commonwealth&#x02019;s attorney or the county attorney; by telephone or otherwise&#x02026;"&#x000a0;Thus, health professionals report when there is suspicion. Health professionals do not need confirmatory proof. Health professionals must report all&#x000a0;cases of&#x000a0;reasonable cause to believe that a child or adolescent has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused. A health professional cannot assume that the report has been made. Health professionals must always make a report if he&#x000a0;suspects a child is or has been abused.</p>
        <p>Kentucky Statute&#x000a0;KRS 620.030(1): "&#x02026;Any supervisor who receives from an employee a report...&#x000a0;shall promptly make a report to the proper authorities for investigation."</p>
        <p>Kentucky Statute&#x000a0;KRS 620.050(1): "Anyone acting upon reasonable cause in the making of a report or acting under KRS 620.030 to KRS 620.050 in good faith shall have immunity from any liability, civil or criminal, that might otherwise be incurred or imposed. Any such participant shall have the same immunity with respect to participation in any judicial proceeding or resulting from such report or action."</p>
        <p>Kentucky Statute on failure to report:&#x000a0;KRS 620.990(1): "Any person intentionally violating the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a Class B misdemeanor. A class B misdemeanor carries a penalty of up to 90 days in jail and/or a fine of up to $250."</p>
        <p>Kentucky Statute 620.050(14): "As a result of any report of suspected child abuse or neglect, photographs and X-rays or other appropriate medical diagnostic procedures may be taken or cause to be taken, without the consent of the parent or other person exercising custodial control or supervision of the child, as a part of the medical evaluation or investigation of these reports. These photographs and X-rays or results of other medical diagnostic procedures may be introduced into evidence in any subsequent judicial proceedings. The person performing the diagnostic procedures or taking photographs or X-rays shall be immune from criminal or civil liability for having performed the act. Nothing herein shall limit liability for negligence."</p>
