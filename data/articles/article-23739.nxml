        <p>Field intubation is the placement of an advanced airway or endotracheal tube (ET) by emergency medical services (EMS) personnel outside the hospital setting. Endotracheal tube intubation (ETI) has long been the standard for airway control in the prehospital setting and is the focus of this activity. While ET placement has a long history of use in the prehospital setting, its use is not without controversy. When compared to in-hospital intubation, higher failure and complication rates have brought the practice of field intubation into question. Nevertheless, there are times when airway control is paramount, and the ability to intubate a patient who has no airway control is a critical skill for prehospital providers. This procedure requires sufficient knowledge of the proper technique and indications for its use. Local protocols and medical direction should guide prehospital providers regarding their use. This activity outlines field intubation procedures in the prehospital setting and highlights the role of the prehospital provider in performing field intubations on patients who require definitive airway control in the prehospital setting.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Field intubation is the placement of an advanced airway or endotracheal tube (ET) by emergency medical services (EMS) personnel outside the hospital setting. There are many techniques available to control a patient&#x02019;s airway or provide rescue ventilation and oxygenation to a patient. ET intubation (ETI), nasotracheal intubation, supraglottic airway devices, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) machines are all viable options in the right clinical situations. ETI has long been the standard for airway control in the prehospital setting and is the focus of this article.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23739.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;While ET placement has a long history of use in the prehospital setting, its use is not without controversy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23739.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;When compared to in-hospital intubation, higher failure and complication rates have brought the practice of field intubation into question.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23739.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Nevertheless, there are times when airway control will be paramount, and the ability to intubate a patient&#x000a0;who has no airway control is a critical skill needed for prehospital providers in the field. This procedure requires a clear understanding of the proper technique and indications for its use. Local protocols and medical direction should guide prehospital providers regarding their use.</p>
        <p>The decision to intubate a patient should carefully be&#x000a0;planned. The procedure can be technically challenging and lead to additional problems even in the best of circumstances. Provider competency and comfort with the procedure may also dictate whether a patient should be intubated. If a provider is unfamiliar or uncomfortable with performing field intubation, alternatives should be used if possible. Supraglottic airways and alternatives to intubation, such as continuing to provide ventilatory support via a bag-valve-mask (BVM) with airway adjuncts or CPAP and BPAP machines, might be better and safer alternatives in certain situations. The use of supraglottic airways, airway adjuncts, and CPAP/BPAP are discussed in separate articles and are not&#x000a0;addressed here. There&#x000a0;will be minor variances in technique and equipment used in-field intubation depending on provider competency and local protocols, but the main concepts should apply across all EMS jurisdictions. Field intubation should be used in patients that have lost control or have an impending loss of their airway, or patients that require increased ventilatory support that cannot be maintained through BVM ventilation and the use of airway adjuncts. Training and practice, appropriate patient evaluation and selection, and preparation in advance of difficult airway situations are all critical to the success of field intubation.</p>
        <p>Despite a long history of prehospital airway management, there is conflicting evidence to show morbidity or mortality benefit when using prehospital intubation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23739.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Much of the published research has focused on the success rates and complication rates of the procedure.&#x000a0; While it is crucial to continue to track prehospital personnel performing field intubation, future studies should also strive to identify emerging techniques, technology, and training methods to improve outcomes.</p>

        <title>Anatomy and Physiology</title>
        <p>The relevant anatomy for field intubation is the oropharynx, larynx, esophagus, and upper airway. Providers need to be able to&#x000a0;identify key landmarks when attempting field intubation to ensure good outcomes. For direct laryngoscopy, the provider should be able to locate at the very&#x000a0;minimum the structures of the oropharynx, epiglottis, arytenoids, and vocal cords to ensure direct visualization of the ET tube entering the trachea. Variances in patient anatomy such as the location of the epiglottis and vocal cords relative to an anterior and posterior position in the oropharynx, or the size of the airway for patients of different body types and ages, can lead to difficulties when intubating a patient. Several mnemonics, acronyms, and scoring systems are available to help identify potentially difficult airway characteristics. A commonly used acronym to help predict a difficult airway is LEMON.&#x000a0; LEMON stands for:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">

            <p>N: Neck Mobility</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>When looking externally, a provider should look for any signs that this may be a difficult airway. Physical characteristics including short or thick necks, obesity, dental conditions such as underbites and overbites, missing teeth, or facial trauma that may make the airway unstable, can all increase the difficulty of the procedure. Three anatomical measurements make up the 3-3-2 rule. Ideally, a patient should be able to open their mouth three finger widths, there should be three finger widths from the chin to the hyoid bone along the mandible, and there should be two finger widths from the hyoid bone to the thyroid notch. Variation in these measurements can indicate a patient with difficult anatomy for intubation. The Mallampati score is an assessment of the oropharyngeal structures that can also identify difficult airways. A patient is scored I to IV on the Mallampati scale based on the oropharyngeal structures seen with the patient's mouth open. A score of I indicates the ideal airway with the entire posterior pharynx fully exposed. A score of II indicates only partial visualization of the posterior pharynx. A score of III indicates that the posterior pharynx cannot be seen, but the base of the uvula is still visible. A score of IV indicates the most difficult airway&#x000a0;when no posterior structures are visible.&#x000a0;Airway obstruction may be anything that could interfere with the direct visualization of the ET tube into the trachea, such as trauma, edema, or masses in the mouth or neck. Neck mobility may be limited by cervical collars, trauma, or preexisting comorbidities and will decrease the provider&#x02019;s ability to align the airway for maximum success.</p>
        <p>In a study by Gaither et al., difficult airway predictors were identified in a retrospective of patients that required intubation in the ED after failed prehospital attempts or non-attempts before arrival in the ED.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23739.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;The study found that airway edema is associated with the highest likelihood of failure or non-attempts in the field. Airway edema was followed by blood, facial trauma, large tongue, short neck, c-spine immobility, vomit, obesity, and a short mandible in decreasing order of difficulty. It was also found that there is an additive effect to these difficult airway predictors and the likelihood of intubation failure increased&#x000a0;significantly when more than one predictor was present. As above, the authors advocated an acronym to help identify potentially difficult airway features. The authors used BE FAST (Blood, Emesis, Facial trauma, Airway edema, Spinal immobilization or short neck, and large Tongue) to identify the most common difficult airway predictors, all of which can also be identified with the use of LEMON above. Which acronym, mnemonic, or scoring system used is less important than ensuring that the method used can quickly and easily identify potential pitfalls before the procedure.</p>

      <sec id="article-23739.s5" sec-type="Contraindications">
        <title>Contraindications</title>
        <p>There are generally accepted contraindications to performing field intubation. Absolute contraindications are hard to define, but if the procedure cannot be completed in a manner that is reasonably safe for both the provider and the patient, field intubation should not be attempted.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23739.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;The situations where absolute contraindications occur include but are not limited to an unstable or dangerous environment, or when there is no provider qualified to perform endotracheal intubation, or when the appropriate&#x000a0;equipment is unavailable.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23739.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Relative contraindications are situation-specific. These include patient circumstances that may place the procedure outside the provider's technical skill, such as severe trauma or a pathological condition that prevents opening the mouth, epiglottitis, copious secretions, vomit, or blood, all of which may impair direct visualization of the airway.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23739.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0; Additionally, there may be contraindications for the use of specific rapid sequence intubation (RSI), or sedation assisted intubation (SAI), pharmacologic agents, based on patient comorbidities and condition.</p>
        <p>Field intubation should also never be used in a punitive manner.&#x000a0; Patients that are intoxicated or uncooperative and have no other medical need for urgent airway control should not be intubated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23739.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;At times,&#x000a0;sedation&#x000a0;or paralyzation of the patient is needed to ensure patients' or providers' safety, but these occurrences should be sporadic&#x000a0;at best.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23739.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0; &#x0201c;Social intubations&#x0201d; should not be considered.</p>
        <p>The time required for arrival to care can be another relative contraindication to field intubation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23739.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Often, especially in an urban environment, the patient may be safely transported with a BVM supporting respirations or&#x000a0;stabilized temporarily with adjuncts such as CPAP when arrival time to a receiving facility is short.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23739.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;The time taken to prepare for and perform the procedure could be better&#x000a0;used to deliver the patient to definitive care where there is more support available and a more controlled environment. Providers in rural areas or air medical personnel may elect to be more aggressive with airway control, as there may be a higher incidence of patient decompensation or increased difficulty performing the procedure en route.</p>

        <p>All personnel involved in field intubation must be adequately trained and be proficient with the procedure. Field intubation should not be undertaken alone if possible since it is nearly impossible to prepare for and safely perform the intubation and other ancillary resuscitative tasks simultaneously without help. Additional personnel can assist with BVM respirations, equipment set-up and control, patient positioning, and external laryngeal positioning.&#x000a0;Having multiple staff available&#x000a0;capable of performing the procedure can also increase the overall success rate by allowing another provider to attempt the procedure if the first provider fails.</p>

        <title>Preparation</title>
        <p>Providers should place and position the patient in as controlled an&#x000a0;environment as possible.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23739.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;In ideal circumstances, the patient should be supine, with the head in a sniffing position as long as it is not contraindicated by trauma or a patient's preexisting conditions. Pads may be placed under the back to align the patient and airway better. These maneuvers can help align the three planes of the airway, the oral plane, the pharyngeal plane, and the tracheal plane, allowing for direct visualization of the airway. The patient should be placed at a height that allows&#x000a0;the provider&#x000a0;with the best possible view of the patient's airway. These conditions are commonly not available in the field and adverse environments. There are anecdotal reports of patients being intubated in a seated or recombinant position in cases of entrapment, but there is little evidence to support these measures, and they may pose a risk to both provider and patient (NAEMSP). The best possible preparation is to anticipate a difficult airway every time and have the necessary&#x000a0;equipment available, as outlined above. It is best to attempt all intubations in a stable environment without unnecessary hazards to patients and providers. All essential equipment should be available, including all rescue adjuncts, before beginning the procedure to avoid delays when needing rescue treatment for a failed airway.</p>

The exact technique varies with the laryngoscope blade choice, but a provider must control the tongue and epiglottis to visualize the vocal cords.&#x000a0; The tongue is controlled by holding the laryngoscope in the provider&#x02019;s left hand and sweeping it to the patient&#x02019;s left. The epiglottis is controlled using the tip of the laryngoscope blade, directly when using a Miller blade, or by inserting the blade tip into the vallecula when using a MAC blade, to expose the vocal cords. Once the cords are visualized, the ET tube is inserted with the provider&#x02019;s right hand until the balloon portion of the tube has just passed the vocal cords.&#x000a0; The stylet is removed, the balloon inflated, and ventilation is provided using a resuscitation bag and reservoir. Placement is then confirmed with ETCO2 colorimetric capnometry or monitored capnography, observing equal chest rise, and auscultation of all lung fields.&#x000a0; Special care is taken to never &#x0201c;rock&#x0201d; the laryngoscope blade in an attempt&#x000a0;to obtain a better view. The oropharynx and epiglottis structures are to be lifted in an anterior and caudal direction to avoid damage to the teeth. Excessive force should be avoided, as this could cause damage to the soft tissues&#x000a0;as well.&#x000a0; There will be times that direct laryngoscopy, or the use of the video laryngoscopy, will fail on the first attempt at intubation. A provider may have difficulty identifying the necessary&#x000a0;anatomical landmarks, need to change equipment, or misplace the ET.&#x000a0; It is customary to allow repeated attempts, but it is generally considered a failed airway after three unsuccessful attempts (Wang HA).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23739.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0; Providers should follow the guidance of their local protocols to define a failed airway, the use of airway adjuncts, and the use of rescue devices.

        <p>Although field intubation has been part of a prehospital provider&#x02019;s scope of practice for some time, there persists a higher complication rate with prehospital intubation than in the in-hospital setting.&#x000a0; The most catastrophic of these complications are the result of misplaced ET tubes, which can lead to hypoxia and a patient's death. &#x000a0;Misplaced endotracheal tubes were found to occur 25% of the time in a study by Katz and Falk in a cohort of 108 field intubations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23739.r15">[15]</xref>&#x000a0;This misplacement rate is markedly higher than other studies examining the frequency of tube misplacement cited by the authors (0.4% to 12%), but the actual rate may be higher than previously anticipated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23739.r15">[15]</xref>&#x000a0;Most of the published studies are retrospective and rely on reported and recorded complications.&#x000a0; Studies such as these are limited by a self-reporting bias that can lead to fewer incidents secondary to a decreased likelihood to report errors by the providers. Additionally, small sample sizes may skew the results in these studies. Katz and Falk found that the majority of misplaced tubes located&#x000a0;in the esophagus, 67%, with the rest in the hypopharynx, 33%.

These periods of hypoxia were accompanied by marked bradycardia, the&#x000a0;second sign of decompensation, in 19% of intubations.&#x000a0; The estimated rate of transient hypoxia varied in other studies, ranging from 10% to 27%, much lower than what was found by Dunford et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23739.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;These complications occurred despite standardized training on preoxygenation and RSI for all paramedics in the trial, and paramedics reporting that 84% of the patients who desaturated as being &#x0201c;easy&#x0201d; to intubate.&#x000a0; The subset of patients examined by Dunford et al.&#x000a0;were all treated by the same EMS company. This higher than average rate of hypoxia episodes shows that possible systemic issues could propagate problems when performing procedures.&#x000a0; Because of these findings, the authors stressed that additional examination of their prescribed protocols for preoxygenation needed to be performed to find the root causes of the above-average complication rate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23739.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Reexamination of protocols in the face of concerning trends is a crucial step for quality improvement within an EMS system and should be completed continuously to identify areas for improvement.Many&#x000a0;post-intubation&#x000a0;complications have been attributed to improper ventilation. Field intubation is a high-stress procedure.&#x000a0; Often providers will be highly energized with adrenalin and singularly focused on the task at hand, resuscitation. In these high-stress periods, providers may over-aggressively ventilate the patient with rapid rescue breathing via a resuscitator bag.&#x000a0; Davis et al. performed several studies examining the rate of hyperventilation and hypocarbia post field intubations in patients with traumatic brain injury and their corresponding effect on mortality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23739.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23739.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;The authors found that severe hyperventilation, defined as ETCO2 of less than 25 mmHg, led to a significantly higher mortality rate in their patient population&#x000a0;than&#x000a0;that which would be explained by injury patterns.&#x000a0; This inadvertent hyperventilation was found to occur in 13.4% of patients. This number decreased to 5.6% in a similar subset of patients when ETCO2 monitors were used to monitor&#x000a0;the&#x000a0;ventilations.

        <p>When examining the efficacy of field intubation, it is important to recognize that these procedures are not performed in a controlled environment of the ED or OR. The use of prehospital airway control is reserved for the &#x0201c;sickest of the sick&#x0201d; patients, with no other intervention available to bridge the patient until definitive treatment is&#x000a0;obtained at a hospital facility. Based on the environmental and resource limitations providers face in the field, it may be unreasonable to expect field intubation success rates to equal those of in-hospital care, but this should not deter further examination and quality improvement measures. The focus of future studies should not only examine overall trends for the success rate of field intubations but also explore how this procedure can be made safer and identify which patients would benefit from the intervention. There should be a conscious effort, like those proposed by Carlson et al., to identify the latest improvements in training methods, equipment, monitoring, and techniques that are&#x000a0;proven to show benefit to patient outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23739.r21">[21]</xref>&#x000a0;These findings should&#x000a0;be incorporated into local protocols and training regimes. While national organizations and government oversight can help provide some&#x000a0;direction and recommendations, the fragmented nature of EMS oversight sets the onus on the medical directors, medical oversight personnel of EMS companies, and the prehospital providers themselves to implement the necessary&#x000a0;changes.</p>
