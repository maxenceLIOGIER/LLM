        <p>Infections from <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic>
<italic toggle="yes">enterica</italic>&#x000a0;serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi, collectively known as enteric fever, present a complex clinical challenge for clinicians worldwide. This activity offers a comprehensive overview of these infections, covering epidemiology, pathophysiology, treatment, complications, patient education, and preventive measures. With symptoms often presenting subtly, clinicians must grasp the nuances of typhoid and paratyphoid fever, recognizing signs such as fever, fatigue, anorexia, headache, malaise, and abdominal discomfort. Moreover, the evolving landscape of antimicrobial-resistant strains, including extensively drug-resistant variants, underscores the need for clinicians to stay updated on the best treatment approaches.</p>
        <p>Through this course, clinicians learn the pivotal role of the interprofessional healthcare team in addressing enteric fever. Collaboration among clinicians, public health experts, and other healthcare professionals enhances patient care by leveraging a multidisciplinary approach. By working collaboratively, clinicians can optimize patient outcomes, especially in low- and middle-income countries where enteric fevers pose significant public health challenges.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever are clinically indistinguishable febrile multisystemic illnesses caused by&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Salmonella&#x000a0;enterica&#x000a0;</italic>serotypes<italic toggle="yes">&#x000a0;</italic>Typhi (S Typhi) and&#x000a0;Paratyphi (S Paratyphi) A, B, and C. Collectively known as enteric fever, more than 9 million people are sickened, and 110,000 die from the disease every year around the globe.[WHO.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/typhoid">Typhoid Fact Sheet.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2023] Enteric fever is the leading cause of community-acquired bloodstream infections in South and Southeast Asia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r2">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;A reportable disease in the United States and many other developed nations, enteric fever is second only to malaria as a cause of severe and sometimes life-threatening infection in travelers.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="33550411">[2]</ext-link></p>
        <p>Following an incubation period of 6 to 30 days, enteric fever presents insidiously with the gradual onset of fever with fatigue, anorexia, headache, malaise, and abdominal symptoms. If treatment is delayed or inadequate, meningitis, sepsis, or intestinal perforation can occur. With a history of&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>&#x000a0;Typhi and&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>&#x000a0;Paratyphi strains rapidly developing antimicrobial resistance with the widespread use of successive antibiotics, the recent emergence of extensively drug-resistant strains has greatly complicated treatment and raised alarms.</p>
        <p><italic toggle="yes">S</italic>&#x000a0;Typhi and&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>&#x000a0;Paratyphi are said to spread by the "4 Fs" (flies, fingers, feces, and fomites). They afflict people living or traveling in low- and middle-income countries around the globe that lack clean water, adequate sanitation, and hygiene, known collectively as WASH. Improved WASH infrastructure is the foundation for decreasing the incidence of enteric fever and other diseases spread via the fecal-oral route.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Historically, enteric fever has received less investment and attention than the "big 3" (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, tuberculosis, and malaria). However, with the specter of untreatable variants on the horizon, enteric fever control efforts have been renewed. Recently developed typhoid conjugate vaccines, improved surveillance and understanding of antimicrobial resistance patterns, and WASH initiatives have decreased the disease burden.</p>
        <p>This activity covers the epidemiology, pathophysiology, treatment, management, complications, patient education, prevention measures, and the role of the interprofessional team in improving patient care and decreasing the burden of this disease. While several barriers to controlling this disease exist, recent advancements provide hope that the impact of enteric fevers can be limited or eliminated in the future.</p>

<bold>Transmission</bold>
</p>
        <p>Transmission is primarily through the fecal-oral route, via consumption of food or water contaminated with the feces of a convalescent or chronic asymptomatic carrier. The importance of chronic carriage to ongoing transmission is well documented in non-endemic countries; however, the role in endemic countries is not well understood. Sexual transmission has rarely been documented among men who have sex with men.[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/infections-diseases/typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever#agent">Yellow Book.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2024]&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">S&#x000a0;</italic>Typhi and&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>&#x000a0;Paratyphi can exist in the environment for a prolonged period in a nonculturable, nonreplicative state. This creates a persistent environmental reservoir that can lead to infection and outbreaks, such as via contaminated crops.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Risk Factors</bold>
</p>
        <p>Different factors determine the risk of enteric fever in endemic versus non-endemic countries. In non-endemic countries, the acquisition of enteric fever is related to travel, contact with a traveler from an endemic country, or exposure to food prepared by a chronic carrier. In contrast, risk factors in endemic countries include individual host factors, environmental exposures, and climate and geographic factors.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Individual host factors</bold>
</p>
        <p>On average, the incidence of enteric fever peaks between the ages of 5 and 9. However, this masks great variability in the age of onset in different locations, with a younger peak age incidence correlating to a higher prevalence of enteric fever. In very high prevalence areas, peak incidence may occur in infants due to increased exposures and the greater accumulated immunity acquired with repeat clinical, subclinical, or asymptomatic infections as people age. Reinfections demonstrate that only a moderate level of protection is conferred by clinical infection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>Typhoid fever is more severe in debilitated and immunocompromised patients such as those with human immunodeficiency virus, on glucocorticoid therapy, or with altered phagocyte function (eg, patients with malaria and sickle cell anemia).&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Salmonellae&#x000a0;</italic>are most commonly acid-sensitive bacteria and are destroyed in the stomach by gastric acid unless a large dose is ingested.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="27889173">[4]</ext-link>&#x000a0;Achlorhydria and intake of antacids and antihistamines increase susceptibility to infection with smaller doses.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Normal flora of the gut is protective against the infection. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics that destroy the normal flora allows increased invasion. Malnutrition decreases normal gut flora and also increases the susceptibility to infection.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="30359449">[5]</ext-link>&#x000a0;Human genetics likely plays a role in susceptibility to typhoid, with a marker mapping to the HLA class II region strongly associated with enteric fever resistance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Environmental exposures</bold>
</p>
        <p>A meta-analysis demonstrated that having an improved water source with a protected well can reduce the risk of culture-confirmed typhoid infection by half.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="37644449">[6]</ext-link>&#x000a0;Having surface water as a water source doubles the risk of typhoid fever compared to other unimproved water sources, such as an unprotected well or spring. Using any household water treatment reduces the risk compared to no treatment. Using metal lids and keeping water containers covered is associated with an 80% lower odds of typhoid infection than keeping water in open containers, while using dirty containers doubles the risk.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>People using unimproved pit latrines had 50 times the risk of enteric fever than those having limited, basic, or safely managed sanitation facilities. Those defecating in the open had 1.2 times the risk. A lack of a handwashing facility with soap and water at home increases the odds by 2.3 compared to those without such facilities.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="37644449">[6]</ext-link>&#x000a0;Independent of vaccination, living in a house with better WASH facilities significantly decreases the risk of enteric fever.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Climatic and geographic factors&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</bold>
</p>
        <p>A distinct seasonal pattern of enteric fever incidence exists globally, with variability accentuated further from the equator. Similarly, a higher incidence of enteric fever occurs with increased temperatures. Between 11&#x000b0; and 35&#x000b0; N, previous rainfall events are positively associated with the incidence of enteric fever. Climate change will likely increase the incidence of enteric fever and other gastrointestinal illnesses via increased flooding, drought, and temperatures, compromising food and water safety.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Burden of Disease&#x000a0;</bold>
</p>
        <p>Enteric fever is a prime example of the "infectious divide" between high-income countries (gross national income per capita in 2021 of &#x0003e;$12,695) and those with low and middle incomes (&#x02264;$1046 and &#x0003e;$1047-$12,695, respectively).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r18">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;In high-income countries, where improvements to sanitation started in the early 1900s, enteric fever is now seen primarily in travelers returning from endemic areas. Incidence remains high in many low- and middle-income countries with poor WASH.</p>
        <p>Due to diagnostic challenges, underdeveloped surveillance systems, and the lack of access to universal health care in many areas, the true incidence of&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>&#x000a0;Typhi and&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>&#x000a0;Paratyphi in much of the world can only be estimated.

In 2019, an estimated 9.2 million (95% CI 5.9-14.1) typhoid fever cases and 110,000 (95% confidence interval; 53,000-191,000) deaths occurred worldwide.

</p>
        <p>As an example of a high-income country, about 400 cases of typhoid fever and 50 to 100 cases of paratyphoid fever were reported each year in the United States from 2016 to 2018. Of these, 85% and 92% are attributed to international travel, with the remainder due to local transmission.[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/infections-diseases/typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever#agent">Yellow Book.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2024] Fewer cases were reported in 2020, likely reflecting decreased travel due to the coronavirus pandemic.[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/typhoid-fever/reports/annual-summary-2020.html">Typhoid and Paratyphoid Surveillance.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2020] The median age was 26 and 24 years for typhoid and paratyphoid cases, respectively. No deaths were reported, although about 82% of cases for which data is available were hospitalized.</p>
        <p>In 76% of cases, international travel was reported where a travel history was available. More than 75% of those with a single destination identified travel to India or Pakistan.

<bold>Antimicrobial Resistance</bold>
</p>
        <p>In low- to middle-income countries, antimicrobial resistance patterns often follow the pattern of antibiotic use and the acquisition and spread of mutations. In high-income countries where travel is the primary risk factor for the acquisition of enteric fever, the prevalence and the pattern of drug resistance among isolates reflect the destination countries for travel. In the United States in 2020, 99% of isolates had a decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. None were multiple drug resistant (MDR), and none were resistant to ceftriaxone, although extremely drug resistant (XDR) cases have previously been reported.[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/typhoid-fever/reports/annual-summary-2020.html">Typhoid and Paratyphoid Surveillance.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2020] Up-to-date information on typhoid and paratyphoid resistance patterns in the United States can be found on the CDC's&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/narmsnow/">National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System</ext-link>&#x000a0;website.</p>

<bold>Antimicrobial Resistance</bold>
</p>
        <p>Antimicrobial resistance has been a significant threat to the control of enteric fever since the advent of antibiotic treatment. Multidrug resistance to all 3 first-line drugs, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and co-trimoxazole, was first identified in 1972 and became common by the 1980s. The accumulated resistance genes of MDR strains are encoded on a large conjugative (self-transmissible) plasmid.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>Estimated to have originated in South Asia in the mid-1980s, H58 isolates are thought to have spread widely due to plasmid-encoded MDR. More susceptible than other&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>&#x000a0;Typhi genotypes to acquiring mutations or mobile genetic elements encoding resistance determinants, H58 (renamed clade 4.3.1, along with its derived genotypes) strains are now found throughout Asia and Southern Africa.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;With the decreased use of the original first-line antibiotics, the reproductive fitness cost of maintaining the MDR-encoding plasmid has led to its lower prevalence in most of Asia.

        <p>The history must include the onset of symptoms, progression of illness, and a full review of symptoms. Symptoms that could indicate severe illness include an altered level of consciousness, severe abdominal pain exacerbated by movement, or severe bloody diarrhea. Pale stool and dark urine may signal hepatitis or biliary complications, while chest pain may be associated with myocarditis or pericarditis. Pancreatitis may present with severe epigastric pain radiating to the back. Osteomyelitis is associated with bone pain.

        <p>Various serological tests for diagnosing typhoid are commercially available and increasingly used due to their low cost and rapid results.

</p>
        <p>Nucleic acid detection methods such as multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or whole genome sequencing allow the genetic signature of the specific genotype to be determined, including the resistance pattern.

        <p>Enteric fever presents as an undifferentiated acute febrile illness resembling multiple other infectious diseases (most commonly confused with malaria). Factors such as time since returning home from travel, ill travel partners, or unusual exposures may suggest or exclude particular diagnoses. While symptoms vary in frequency across different conditions, most are not sufficiently specific upon presentation to be useful to rule in or out particular conditions. The CDC Yellow Book describes the approach to a febrile returning traveler, with a complete list of potential illnesses and their associated incubation periods.[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/infections-diseases/typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever#agent">Yellow Book.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2024]</p>
        <p>The parasite<italic toggle="yes">&#x000a0;Plasmodium falciparum&#x000a0;</italic>causes the most deadly form of malaria. This parasite has an incubation period of 8 to 11 days, while most other&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Plasmodium</italic>&#x000a0;species have an incubation period of 9 to 17 days. For&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">P malaria</italic>, the incubation period is usually 18 to 40 days but can rarely last several years. Rigors are more commonly seen with malaria than with enteric fever. The use of preventive medication does not rule out the diagnosis. Amoebiasis is a less common parasitic infection in the differential. Like enteric fever, amoebiasis is transmitted via the fecal-oral route and can present with fever, bloody diarrhea, and abdominal pain.</p>
        <p>The many bacterial illnesses on the differential include leptospirosis, scrub and murine typhus, bacterial meningitis, brucellosis, and bacterial gastroenteritis. Those with leptospirosis may have a history of contact with animals or adventure sports and contact with mud. People with typhus may be found to have a bite mark initially resembling a cigarette burn but developing into black eschar. Those with bacterial gastroenteritis may be more likely to have profuse diarrhea.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>A wide variety of viral illnesses can also present with an undifferentiated fever. These include influenza, COVID-19, dengue, viral hepatitis, Chikungunya, viral meningitis, yellow fever, Ebola viruses, and many others, depending on the location of residence or travel. Cough is usually more prominent in influenza and COVID, with associated upper viral symptoms. People with dengue or "breakbone" fever may have severe arthralgias. Returning home more than 6 days before the onset of symptoms would exclude yellow fever, dengue, and Chikungunya.</p>

<bold>Relapse</bold>

        <p>Relapse is defined as a recurrence of symptoms with laboratory confirmation of&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>&#x000a0;Typhi from a normally sterile site within 1 month of completing an appropriate course of antimicrobial treatment and resolution of symptoms. Relapse occurs in less than 10% of patients, usually 1 to 3 weeks after clinical recovery. Further antibiotic treatment is required.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Chronic Carriage</bold>
</p>
        <p>Convalescent carriage of&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>&#x000a0;Typhi and&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>&#x000a0;Paratyphi can continue for a few weeks to months after treatment of enteric fever.

However, 1% to 4% of patients with typhoid fever become chronic carriers, demonstrating shedding for at least 12 months after finishing an appropriate course of antibiotics.[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/infections-diseases/typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever#agent">Yellow Book.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2024] Chronic carriage is less common with adequate antibiotic treatment and&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>&#x000a0;Paratyphi infections.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Confirmation of chronic carriage is difficult due to intermittent shedding and low organism levels in the stool. A stool culture or polymerase chain reaction is used to determine persistent carriage. Sufficient time must elapse between finishing antibiotics and testing to ensure antibiotic clearance. PCR testing can also detect bacterial DNA well after viable bacteria are cleared. An anti-Vi antibody-based test has been developed for use in nonendemic areas but is unreliable in medium- to high-prevalence areas where regular infection or exposure results in higher baseline titers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r2">[2]</xref></p>

        <p>
<bold>Patients with Enteric Fever</bold>
</p>
        <p>Patients treated on an outpatient basis or who return home after hospitalization and their caretakers need to be aware of methods to prevent transmission within the household. Convalescent carriage of&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>&#x000a0;Typhi and&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>&#x000a0;Paratyphi may last for weeks or even months after acute illness. Hand hygiene with soap and water is of critical importance. Caretakers must be given instructions about caring for the ill person, including the need for gloves, strict hygiene, and safe disposal of potentially contaminated feces or urine. Recently ill people should not prepare food or engage in other activities that may result in transmission within the household.&#x000a0;Patients should be informed that previous enteric fever does not provide long-lasting protection. Vaccination should be recommended if future or ongoing risk exists.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Individual Prevention Measures</bold>
</p>
        <p>Washing hands frequently with soap and water and drying hands thoroughly after washing are basic measures for avoiding enteric illnesses. This includes before preparing food, after using the bathroom or changing diapers, and after caring for an ill person. Alochol-based sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol can be used where water and soap are not available but are not as effective as soap and water for some pathogens.[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/infections-diseases/typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever#agent">Yellow Book.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2024] Hands should be thoroughly washed immediately after using sanitizers.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Maintaining food and water precautions is also essential for travelers and people living in endemic areas. Raw or undercooked meat, fish, shellfish, and produce carry the greatest risk of contamination. Unpasteurized fruit juices, salads, unpeeled fruits, and unpasteurized milk and cheeses should be avoided. All cooked foods should be fully cooked and served hot. Patients should be advised to avoid foods in restaurants that may have been cooked ahead and reheated before serving, such as lasagna, and those sold by street vendors. Buffets should be avoided.&#x000a0;Where drinking water safety is uncertain, water should be adequately treated, or only bottled water should be consumed&#x02014;this includes drinking, preparing food and beverages, brushing teeth, making ice, and cooking. Hot drinks such as tea or coffee are generally considered safe.</p>
        <p>For bottle-fed infants, either prepared liquid formula should be used, or particular care should be taken when preparing formula. Water for reconstitution should be hot (&#x02265;70 &#x000b0;C).[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/infections-diseases/typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever#agent">Yellow Book.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2024] The formula should be used within 2 hours, and any remaining after feeding should be discarded. &#x000a0;Counsel patients about when to seek medical if febrile. VFR travelers are most likely to become infected with enteric fever, as they are less likely to maintain precautions regarding food and water and are less likely than other travelers to obtain pretravel advice.[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/infections-diseases/typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever#agent">Yellow Book.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2024]&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Vaccination</bold>
</p>
        <p>Typhoid vaccination is recommended for travelers to endemic areas, particularly those traveling to South Asia and those with health- or travel-related risks traveling to other endemic areas. This includes children, VFR, prolonged travel abroad, anatomic or functional asplenia, the use of acid suppressants, or personal preference. Vaccination does not preclude the need for hand hygiene and food and water precautions. The vaccines currently available in nonendemic areas are not fully effective, and the risk of other illnesses transmitted by the fecal-oral route remains. &#x000a0;&#x000a0;In endemic countries where typhoid vaccination is not integrated into routine vaccination schedules, patients at higher risk of severe disease may obtain typhoid vaccination for private pay.</p>

        <p>The WHO has prequalified 2 typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs): Typbar-TCV and TYPHIBEV.

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>Despite public health efforts, enteric fever is still a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the United States and other developed nations, it is a source of life-threatening illness, mainly in travelers. An interprofessional healthcare team is essential to all aspects of enteric fever prevention and treatment.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Access to Quality Health Care</bold>
</p>
        <p>Primary care and public health providers are important resources for travelers and people living in endemic areas to emphasize individual prevention measures to decrease the risk of enteric fever and other food and water-borne diseases. For example, in nonendemic countries, healthcare providers can advise patients of their risk of typhoid before travel and advise vaccine. In areas with poor sanitation in endemic countries, campaigns promoting the use of soap and water have been shown to decrease the risk of gastrointestinal illnesses.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Healthcare providers in primary care and emergency settings are usually the first to encounter febrile travelers. A broad differential diagnosis and high index of suspicion in these settings allow the timely diagnosis of enteric fever. Using established regional, national, or international guidelines developed by infectious disease and public health colleagues can improve empiric treatment and avoid unnecessary complications. Reporting enteric fever is usually required within 24 hours in most developed countries to minimize community spread. For patients treated at home, community nursing can provide follow-up and recommend hygiene measures to avoid illness in other family members. For patients requiring hospitalization, timely referral to surgical, infectious disease, or critical care specialists may be required.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The provision of quality care includes the need for increased diagnostic and surveillance capacity in low- to middle-income countries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Community health education about the mode of transmission, prevention, signs and symptoms, and the importance of early treatment can also reduce the incidence and burden of disease. Intersectoral coordination by public health and nonmedical organizations and authorities in sanitation management, awareness of individual prevention measures, and nutritional programs boost disease control and prevention.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>WASH</bold>
</p>
        <p>The importance of improved global access to and use<bold>&#x000a0;</bold>of infrastructure supporting safe washing, sanitation, and hygiene cannot be understated. However, coverage for basic sanitation services was less than 50% in sub-Saharan Africa, India, Bangladesh, and Nepal in 2015.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Improving clean drinking water access is necessary but insufficient to decrease enteric fever's burden. Human waste must also be disposed of safely away from populations, water supplies, and crops. Legislation may be required to address agricultural practices. Point-of-collection disinfection methods can provide lower-cost and easier-to-use options when governmental resources are insufficient to develop and maintain complicated water treatment infrastructure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;WASH is critical to overall population health improvement, decreasing the incidence not only of enteric fever but also other food and water-borne diseases.

        <p>
<bold>Population Approaches to Vaccination</bold>
</p>
        <p>Vaccination is an important adjunct to WASH efforts to control typhoid globally. The current (2018) WHO guidelines on the use of typhoid vaccines recommend the programmatic use of TCVs in countries with endemic typhoid in combination with health education, WASH improvements, and HCW training on typhoid fever diagnosis and treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r16">[16]</xref>&#x000a0;Integration into routine vaccination schedules improves coverage. Prioritization of those countries with the highest incidences of disease or high rates of AMR is advised. Co-administration with other vaccines has been proven to not interfere with immune responses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r17">[17]</xref>&#x000a0;TCV use in outbreaks in endemic countries is also recommended and has been effectively used in outbreaks in Zimbabwe and Pakistan.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Integration into routine childhood immunization programs is estimated to be cost-effective or highly cost-effective in all countries with high to very high typhoid fever incidence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r16">[16]</xref>&#x000a0;In some Asian countries, the programmatic use of TCV could be cost-saving. In all countries, programmatic decisions such as immunization age should be based on the local epidemiology of typhoid fever, antimicrobial resistance patterns, cost analyses, and consideration of the routine childhood immunization program.</p>
        <p>Catch-up vaccination campaigns targeting children aged up to 14 are also recommended where feasible and supported by data to maximize impact.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r18">[18]</xref><bold>&#x000a0;</bold>Single-age vaccine programs may be more cost-saving in some settings. For example, providing 1 dose at 9 months of age with a parallel catch-up program at 15 could avert up to 67 million cases in the 73 low- to middle-income countries eligible for Gavi the Vaccine Alliance funding over 10 years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r18">[18]</xref>&#x000a0;Depending on the age structure and vaccination coverage, 46% to 74% of cases in individual countries could be avoided.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Six countries now have a childhood vaccination program. Starting in 2019, Pakistan was the first country to implement a campaign through a phased approach. Since then, Liberia (2021), Nepal (2022), Zimbabwe (2021), Samoa (phased, starting 2021), and Malawi (2023) have implemented programs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r18">[18]</xref>&#x000a0;In Nepal, Pakistan, and Zimbabwe, integrated campaigns were conducted, including various other interventions such as identifying un- or under-vaccinated children, administering other vaccines, supplementing vitamin A, and promoting hygiene.

<bold>Public Health Measures and Outbreak Control</bold>
</p>
        <p>In countries where enteric fever is a reportable disease, once a report is received, public health assesses whether the source of infection (ie, travel versus locally acquired) poses an ongoing risk of transmission to the local population and ensures that the affected individual does not transmit the illness to others. The discovery of local transmission triggers an investigation, which can include searching for additional cases, food testing, interviewing coworkers, and public communications to advise others who may be at risk, for example, if a person worked while ill or was a chronic carrier.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Local, state, or national codes or guidelines determine specific requirements for exclusion. Public health authorities may restrict recently recovered individuals from daycare attendance or participating in certain high-risk occupations for transmission until 2 to 3 stool cultures taken at least 48 hours apart are negative for&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>&#x000a0;Typhi and&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>&#x000a0;Paratyphi.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r17">[17]</xref>[WA Gov.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/legacy/Documents/5100//420-083-Guideline-Typhoid.pdf">Typhoid.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2018][FL Gov.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/disease-reporting-and-management/disease-reporting-and-surveillance/_documents/gsi-typhoid-fever.pdf">Typhoid.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2013] High-risk occupations include food handlers, healthcare and childcare workers, and water park employees.

        <p>Public health commonly addresses outbreaks even where individual case follow-up does not occur. Outbreaks may be identified by increased hospitalizations or incidence of nontraumatic intestinal perforations. In these instances, coordinated public health education campaigns, swiftly administering vaccines, and addressing sanitation concerns can decrease the burden of typhoid fever illness.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="32228795">[20]</ext-link></p>
        <p>
<bold>Antimicrobial Stewardship</bold>
</p>
        <p>Increasing antimicrobial resistance is one of the most pressing global public health issues. While new antimicrobials continue to be developed, bacteria develop resistance far faster. &#x000a0;Although&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>&#x000a0;Typhi and&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>&#x000a0;Paratyphi are exclusively human pathogens, antimicrobial resistance factors mediated by plasmids can transfer between&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic>&#x000a0;and other bacteria. Thus, the lack of access to health care and widespread use of antibiotics for undifferentiated fevers, particularly in typhoid-endemic areas, contributes to the global burden of AMR. The occasional azithromycin-resistant&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic>&#x000a0;strain and the discovery of plasmid-mediated carbapenem-resistant&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic>&#x000a0;co-circulating with MDR typhoid are particularly problematic, with the concern for strains resistant to all current antibiotics developing.</p>
        <p>In addition to WASH measures, improved diagnostic modalities and vaccination programs can effectively decrease AMR due to enteric disease. Due to the high rate of treatment for enteric fever, with an estimated 3 to 25 infections treated per every culture-confirmed case, typhoid vaccinations integrated into childhood vaccination programs would also decrease AMR due to typhoid by 16% and reduce resistance in bystander organisms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Surveillance and Reporting&#x000a0;</bold>
</p>
        <p>Accurate surveillance and reporting are critical to enteric fever control to assess disease burden, rapidly detect outbreaks, determine emerging AMR patterns, and evaluate vaccine impact. However, the capacity for surveillance and the precision and accuracy of estimates vary significantly between nations. &#x000a0;For example, reporting positive&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>&#x000a0;Typhi and&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>&#x000a0;Paratyphi results by laboratories to local public health authorities must occur within 24 hours in the United States. From there, clinical data on laboratory-confirmed&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>&#x000a0;Typhi and&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">S&#x000a0;</italic>Paratyphi cases is reported to the National Typhoid and Paratyphoid Surveillance System; laboratory-confirmed and clinically compatible cases linked to a laboratory-confirmed case of enteric fever are entered into the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). Highly accurate totals of clinical disease are generally obtained, notwithstanding the likelihood that NNDSS data is incomplete due to incomplete reporting and the inability to reconcile data sets during the COVID-19 pandemic.[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/typhoid-fever/reports/annual-summary-2020.html">Typhoid and Paratyphoid Surveillance.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2020] However, even robust surveillance systems cannot capture the true incidence due to subclinical infections.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The WHO recommends facility-based surveillance in all endemic countries, with laboratory confirmation of the infection. The recommended minimum parameters for monitoring the disease burden are mortality, morbidity, and economic impact.<bold>&#x000a0;</bold>The United Nations rolled out an electronic Joint Reporting Form in 2018, with reporting to the WHO and UNICEF.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r18">[19]</xref><bold>&#x000a0;</bold>The WHO Global Antimicrobial Surveillance System (GLASS) additionally collates AMR patterns across all&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic>&#x000a0;species, with suggestions from some authors that typhoidal&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Salmonellae</italic>&#x000a0;be separated from NTS in the future.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>In recent years, substantial investments in surveillance systems in less developed endemic countries have been made. However, significant regional surveillance gaps remain. In many endemic countries, the number of lab-confirmed cases dramatically underestimates the true incidence of enteric fever due to the following:</p>

        <p>Population studies are required to estimate the true incidence of disease more accurately.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r18">[19]</xref>&#x000a0;These are costly, time-consuming, technically challenging, and unavailable in most countries. Three ongoing surveillance projects covering 10 countries are essential for population estimates (Bangladesh, Nepal, Malawi, Pakistan, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Madagascar, and Nigeria). The Global Burden of Disease Study, most recently published in 2019, estimates rates and case counts from published studies, publically available data sets, and contributed data across 369 diseases and injuries across 205 countries and territories.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="33069326">[21]</ext-link><bold>&#x000a0;</bold></p>
        <p>More recently, global collaborations, improved surveillance systems and distribution, and improved methods to estimate the incidence of enteric fever and determine the prevalence of AMR have improved the availability of more granular AMR patterns, including in areas with little or no data.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;For example, a 2024 spatiotemporal mathematical modeling study estimated phenotypic AMR prevalence in 75 endemic countries using 601 data sources for&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>&#x000a0;Typhi antibiotic resistance patterns from 45 countries over 30 years. A 2023 meta-analysis used all available published and unpublished Typhi genomes from the previous 21 years (12,965 high-quality genomes from 110 countries).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;This study analyzed AMR patterns using whole genome sequencing to determine phenotype. The study also used specimens from travel-related cases from national reference laboratories in high-income countries to provide some data in countries and regions with low capacity for performing blood cultures.<bold>&#x000a0;</bold></p>
        <p>This need to maximize information recovery from other sources is well-recognized. Countries without robust surveillance can improve disease estimates using data from various sources, including neighboring countries or regions, population-based studies, modeling data, lab-confirmed cases, AMR testing studies, outbreak reports, and non-traumatic intestinal perforation case reports. &#x000a0;The recent use of pooled genomic surveillance may allow for early identification of shifts in AMR patterns or evidence of clonal spread. For example, the identification of the extensively drug-resistant strain identified in Pakistan in 2016 was found to have emerged in 2015.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="33057330">[22]</ext-link></p>

<bold>Research and innovation</bold>
</p>
        <p>Improving diagnostic technologies for enteric fever is a priority for research and innovation. Limitations contribute to under- and over-diagnosis, poorer clinical outcomes, and increased antimicrobial resistance. Improved diagnostic techniques will also enhance surveillance. (Refer to the Evaluation section for further information on recent advances in diagnostic technologies).</p>
        <p>Another priority is the development of a paratyphoid vaccine. While the Ty21a vaccine may provide some cross-coverage against S Paratyphi B, no vaccine is currently sufficiently effective for controlling S Paratyphi infection; this is particularly concerning in South and Southeast Asia, where&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>&#x000a0;Paratyphi is most prevalent. Paratyphi may also increase proportionally as Typhoid vaccination increases.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>With very few options available, new antimicrobial therapies are also needed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;While resistance to former first-line antibiotics is decreasing in some areas due to reduced use, high resistance in other regions and the constant threat of re-emergence continue to limit widespread utility.</p>
        <p>Expanded and improved surveillance and epidemiological methodologies are also a priority in improving enteric fever control. For example, environmental surveillance using a nucleic acid amplification test is hoped to enhance understanding of the incidence of infection, prevalence of AMR, and other critical surveillance issues.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r8">[8]</xref><bold>&#x000a0;</bold>By identifying countries at the highest risk of AMR S Typhi and S Paratyphi, phylogeographic studies can help prioritize the implementation of WASH measures, vaccination programs, and improvements to public health capacity.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="37845201">[23]</ext-link></p>
        <p>The expansion of genomic surveillance is predicted to improve the measurement of the impact of TCVs on local&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>&#x000a0;Typhi populations and decisions about future combination Typhi vaccines, using techniques already used for pneumococcal conjugate vaccines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30719.r17">[17]</xref>&#x000a0;Genomic surveillance will be important in monitoring changes in clinically important resistances in&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>&#x000a0;Typhi and&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>&#x000a0;Paratyphi. Combined with environmental surveillance, early evidence of clonal spread of known resistant organisms could provide early warning of a likely increase in prevalence.
