        <p>Epiphrenic diverticulum, also known as pulsion diverticulum, is a rare form of esophageal diverticulum occurring in the distal 10 centimeters of the esophagus, most commonly 4 to 8 cm above the gastric cardia. Patients with this condition often present with dysphagia, regurgitation of undigested food, and chest pain.&#x000a0;Respiratory symptoms like chronic cough or recurrent aspiration pneumonia occasionally arise due to food stasis in the diverticulum. Some patients may remain asymptomatic,&#x000a0;with&#x000a0;the diverticulum incidentally discovered during investigations for other conditions.</p>
        <p>The pathogenesis of epiphrenic diverticula is often linked to esophageal motility disorders, such as achalasia, which cause increased intraluminal pressure and subsequent outpouching of the esophageal wall. Diagnosis is typically made through imaging studies, with barium swallow radiography being highly effective in visualizing the diverticulum. Endoscopy may also be utilized for direct visualization and to rule out malignancy.</p>
        <p>Management includes both conservative and surgical approaches. Small, asymptomatic diverticula may only require monitoring, while symptomatic cases often necessitate surgical intervention. Surgical options include diverticulectomy combined with esophageal&#x000a0;myotomy to address any underlying motility disorder and prevent recurrence.&#x000a0;Minimally invasive techniques such as laparoscopic or thoracoscopic surgery&#x000a0;may also be&#x000a0;employed to reduce recovery time and complications.</p>
        <p>This activity for healthcare professionals is designed to enhance learners' proficiency in evaluating and managing epiphrenic diverticulum. Participants gain a deeper insight into the condition's pathogenesis and clinical presentation,&#x000a0;as well as&#x000a0;the best diagnostic and management practices. Greater competence equips learners to collaborate within an interprofessional team caring for patients with&#x000a0;epiphrenic diverticula, enhancing outcomes.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Esophageal diverticulum, a relatively rare condition, is classified based on its location in the esophagus: proximal (Zenker or phrenoesophageal, comprising 70% of cases), midesophageal (thoracic and mediastinal, 10% of cases), or distal (epiphrenic, 20% of patients).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21250.r1">[1]</xref> Epiphrenic diverticulum,&#x000a0;or pulsion diverticulum, is a rare type of esophageal diverticulum occurring in the distal 10 centimeters of the esophagus, most&#x000a0;often 4 to 8 cm&#x000a0;superior to the gastric cardia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21250.r2">[2]</xref> These diverticula comprise the mucosal and submucosal lining, herniating through a weakness in the muscularis layer of the esophagus, classifying them as false or pseudodiverticula.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21250.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21250.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;This anatomical weakness in the muscularis layer is where nerves and blood vessels enter to supply the distal esophagus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21250.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>The surgical treatment for symptomatic esophageal diverticula varies according to its location. Surgical approaches for lower esophageal (epiphrenic) diverticula have evolved from the initial open transthoracic method to the currently preferred abdominal approach, particularly with the advent of laparoscopy. This preference is likely due to the enhanced visualization of the gastroesophageal junction and distal esophagus during myotomy and the ability to perform fundoplication simultaneously, as many patients are also diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-21250.s3" sec-type="Etiology">
        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>The most frequent location for esophageal diverticula is on the right side of the lower esophagus, occurring in approximately 70% of cases. Most patients have a single diverticulum, but about 15% may have multiple. These diverticula typically develop due to increased intraluminal pressure caused by functional obstruction in the distal esophagus, with common causes including achalasia, a hypertensive distal esophageal sphincter, and diffuse motility spasm. Previous studies have indicated that esophageal spasm accounts for 38% of cases, achalasia for 16%, and nutcracker esophagus for 8%&#x02014;while 27% of patients exhibit normal esophageal motility.&#x000a0;The condition can also occur as a postoperative complication of a tight fundoplication, which can lead to distal mechanical obstruction and increased intraluminal pressure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21250.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21250.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21250.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Recognizing the etiology of epiphrenic diverticula is essential to determine the type of treatment necessary to decrease reoccurrence.</p>

      <sec id="article-21250.s4" sec-type="Epidemiology">
        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>Esophageal epiphrenic diverticulum, a pulsion diverticulum located in the distal third of the esophagus, is a rare condition with an estimated prevalence of approximately 0.02% to 3%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21250.r9">[9]</xref> Men show a slightly higher incidence, with a peak age between the sixth and seventh decades of life. Patients&#x000a0;may be&#x000a0;asymptomatic&#x000a0;or experience complications such as esophagitis, bleeding from ulcerations, impaction, and stasis with regurgitation. These symptoms often overlap with those of achalasia or other motility disorders. The manifestations are typically caused by the underlying motility issue rather than the diverticulum itself, with no correlation to the size of the diverticulum. Cancer, specifically squamous cell carcinoma, is associated with epiphrenic diverticula. However, malignant transformation is rare, occurring in about 0.6% of patients.&#x000a0;Affected individuals are more likely to be of the male sex (83%),&#x000a0;older (mean age 68), and&#x000a0;with larger diverticula (&#x0003e;5 cm).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21250.r10">[10]</xref></p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-21250.s5" sec-type="History and Physical">
        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>Epiphrenic diverticula present variably, depending on the size and the underlying motility disorder. The primary symptoms of esophageal epiphrenic diverticulum include dysphagia, regurgitation, weight loss, heartburn, respiratory issues, and retrosternal pain when swallowing food. Small diverticula&#x000a0;without associated motility disorders may be asymptomatic, and the diverticulum is only discovered incidentally.&#x000a0;However, larger diverticula or those&#x000a0;with a concurrent motility disorder can present with worsening dysphagia and regurgitation&#x02014;the&#x000a0;2 most common symptoms.</p>
        <p>Other symptoms include chest pain, heartburn, nocturnal cough, and asthma. Worrisome symptoms include weight loss, aspiration pneumonia, hematemesis, melena, and odynophagia, which may signify malignant transformation into esophageal carcinoma. Complications can arise as the diverticulum grows and may include severe heartburn (secondary to stasis) or compression of neighboring structures (eg, the esophagus, lung, and heart).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21250.r11">[11]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21250.r12">[12]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-21250.s6" sec-type="Evaluation">
        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>The anatomy of the diverticulum and the commonly associated motility disorders determine the type and range of diagnostic evaluation needed for the epiphrenic diverticulum.&#x000a0;The workup usually consists of a barium swallow, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), and manometry. An esophagogram using barium contrast helps define the diverticulum's anatomical characteristics,&#x000a0;guiding&#x000a0;surgical planning. A contrast study helps determine the diverticulum's location and size, assess motility, and identify any associated strictures or lesions. These diverticula are most commonly noted on the right side (70%) and are single; however, up to 15% can&#x000a0;occur in multiples.</p>
        <p>Upper endoscopy helps visualize&#x000a0;the inner esophageal lining, evaluating for ulcers, esophagitis, carcinoma, or hiatal hernia.&#x000a0;Endoscopy typically confirms these findings, boasting a 91% sensitivity when used alone.&#x000a0;Manometry is crucial for evaluating the motor functions of the esophagus. Manometry confirms the presence of a motility disorder. Each of these studies helps determine the type of surgery to be performed.&#x000a0;For patients with symptomatic reflux, pH monitoring is necessary to distinguish between true reflux and reflux originating from a diverticulum. Some studies, however, argue that manometry and pH studies are not essential, as these modalities are used with the assumption that a distal motility disorder is always present.</p>

      <sec id="article-21250.s7" sec-type="Treatment / Management">
        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>The optimal surgical approach for&#x000a0;epiphrenic diverticula is still debated.&#x000a0;A thoracotomy was traditionally the standard procedure. However, recent minimally invasive surgery advancements have led to the adoption of the laparoscopic transhiatal approach, which has been widely reported. Despite its advantages, the&#x000a0;laparoscopic transhiatal approach has potential drawbacks, such as the need for conversion to an unplanned transthoracic approach if the upper part of the diverticulum is not visible or dense adhesions are present. Addressing these drawbacks&#x000a0;may necessitate unexpected changes in positioning or anesthesia techniques, such as switching to single-lung ventilation, and has been associated with a complication rate of up to 45% due to incomplete diverticulectomy and myotomy. Thus, determining the optimal surgical approach requires thorough preoperative planning and simulation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21250.r13">[13]</xref></p>
        <p>Surgical indications are not based on size but on symptoms such as worsening dysphagia, regurgitation, food retention, or complications such as aspiration pneumonia, perforation, and cancer. Asymptomatic epiphrenic diverticula may be managed nonoperatively. The surgical approach&#x000a0;may be either open or laparoscopic/robotic, with a trend toward the minimally invasive approach due to its decreased pain, length of stay, and mortality.</p>
        <p>Open approaches can be via laparotomy, left thoracotomy, or a combined thoracoabdominal approach. Minimally invasive procedures can be transhiatal or transthoracic, depending on the distance of the diverticulum from the lower esophageal sphincter. Robot-assisted devices like the Da Vinci Surgical System may also be used, offering better visualization than the traditional laparoscopic or thoracoscopic approach. Routine myotomy is commonly employed due to the high&#x000a0;incidence of an underlying motility disorder. Without this procedure, diverticular recurrence rates can approach 20%, with leak rates approaching 24%.</p>
        <p>The extent of subdiverticular myotomy is more critical than the proximal length&#x000a0;when&#x000a0;addressing&#x000a0;the area of obstruction. This procedure is performed from 90&#x000b0; to 180&#x000b0; from the diverticulectomy site to avoid a leak.&#x000a0;A myotomy is usually followed by a partial fundoplication to limit postoperative reflux,&#x000a0;which has been noted to occur in 48% of patients versus 9.5% after a Dor fundoplication.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-21250.s8" sec-type="Differential Diagnosis">
        <title>Differential Diagnosis</title>
        <p>Epiphrenic diverticula may present in numerous ways, as previously mentioned; thus, the differential diagnosis can be vast. Symptoms of dysphagia and regurgitation&#x000a0;may be present in other esophageal diverticula, such as Zenker and traction diverticula. A barium esophagogram can help distinguish these diverticula&#x000a0;based on their anatomical location. These symptoms are also present in many esophageal motility disorders, which may or may not be the underlying cause of the diverticulum. Manometric studies can&#x000a0;guide management. Other differentials to consider are acid reflux, hiatal hernia, benign tumors, and esophageal cancer, all of which can be differentiated based on the standard workup, including esophagogram, EGD, and manometry.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-21250.s9" sec-type="Prognosis">
        <title>Prognosis</title>
        <p>Asymptomatic&#x000a0;epiphrenic diverticula are managed with nonoperative treatments. Patients develop complications or symptoms less than 10% of the time.&#x000a0;The resolution of symptoms after surgical management in epiphrenic diverticulum approaches 90% in some studies,&#x000a0;especially when diverticulectomy is combined with myotomy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21250.r14">[14]</xref></p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-21250.s10" sec-type="Complications">
        <title>Complications</title>
        <p>Complications of epiphrenic diverticula can arise from both the disease and its treatment. Large diverticula can cause regurgitation, food stasis, and aspiration. Other complications, though rare, include ulceration, adhesions, abscesses, fistulas, bleeding, perforation, and malignant degeneration. Despite their rarity, a thorough evaluation is crucial before managing the diverticulum.</p>
        <p>Postoperative complications may include leaks from the suture line or missed mucosal injuries during the myotomy, dysphagia resulting from an incomplete myotomy or tight wrap, and reflux. The most common postoperative complication is a suture line leak in 5% to 37% of patients. Key risk factors for leaks include using multiple staple cartridges, a wide diverticulum neck, and&#x000a0;having a mediastinal location.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-21250.r15">[15]</xref></p>
        <p>Reported postsurgical morbidity rates range from 5.3 % to 50%, with mortality rates up to 9% and a leak rate of 16.6%. Surgical success is achieved in approximately 70% of cases, though symptoms remain unchanged at 21% and worsen at 8%. Postoperative acid reflux occurs in up to 60% of patients, a risk that&#x000a0;may be mitigated by incorporating a partial fundoplication. Patients&#x000a0;may have a successful outcome with a 22-month follow-up.</p>

        <title>Deterrence and Patient Education</title>
        <p>To effectively manage an epiphrenic diverticulum, patients must be aware of the signs and symptoms associated with the disease process.&#x000a0;Patients&#x000a0;should also understand red flags that may allude to more worrisome pathology, such as perforation or malignancy. Patients who are asymptomatic should relay the presence of the diverticulum to healthcare workers and be on the lookout for possible symptoms. Blind esophageal intubation should be avoided to help prevent an iatrogenic injury such as diverticulum perforation.</p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>Epiphrenic diverticula is a complex disorder that requires input from an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals. Epiphrenic diverticula may be approached in a medical or surgical direction due to their myriad symptoms. Managing the condition thus requires several specialists, from general practitioners to gastroenterologists and general&#x000a0;or thoracic surgeons. Strong communication between specialties can help&#x000a0;identify patients with epiphrenic diverticulum, rule out other differentials,&#x000a0;and rule in underlying pathologies like motility disorders.</p>
        <p>Treatment strategies center around a thorough workup that includes esophagograms, EGDs, and manometry, but a physician's clinical perspective ultimately involves combining all the data for an accurate diagnosis.&#x000a0;The general practitioner can help ensure early diagnosis of epiphrenic diverticula and prevent major complications by coordinating with gastroenterology and surgery early in the dysphagia workup.</p>
