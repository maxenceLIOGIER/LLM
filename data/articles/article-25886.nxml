        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Night terrors are a common preschool-aged sleep disorder in which a child quickly wakes up from sleep in a terrified state. For the majority of these episodes, the child will not&#x000a0;have any recollection of this event ever happening.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25886.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25886.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25886.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25886.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>A night terror is considered a parasomnia due to its characterization of unusual physical and verbal behaviors. Parasomnias can often occur during any stage of sleep; however, night terrors specifically are associated with non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stages in which the person or child is in a transitional state between sleep and wakefulness.</p>
        <p>The act of sleeping can be categorically broken down into several stages and states. There are three primary states of&#x000a0;sleep consisting of (1) wake, (2) non-REM sleep, and&#x000a0; (3) REM sleep. Within these states, they are further broken down into separate stages. Sleep stages 1, 2, 3, and 4 are considered non-REM sleep, while stage 5 is considered REM sleep. The different sleep stages represent different electrical patterns and frequencies in the brain that can be detected and measured with an electroencephalogram (EEG). These states and stages can overlap each other, and it is during these transition states that parasomnias can occur.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25886.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25886.r6">[6]</xref></p>
        <p>Night terrors can cause severe distress, followed by a state of panic and a sensation of helplessness. Most episodes last 45-90 minutes and are most common as the individual passes through stages 3 and 4 non-rapid eye movement sleep. Night terrors are most common in between ages 4 until puberty.</p>

      <sec id="article-25886.s3" sec-type="Etiology">
        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>Because there is no clear transition between the primary sleep states and stages, there are multiple time periods in a single&#x000a0;duration of sleep in which a person can be in a combination of both wakefulness and sleep. Herein lies the most accepted theory of parasomnia etiology.</p>
        <p>Furthermore,&#x000a0;there are theories that there is a genetic component; however, this has never been proven and remains antidotal. The exact etiology is unknown; however, there are strong correlations with fever and illness, excessive physical activity, excessive caffeine or alcohol intake, lack of sleep and exhaustion, and emotional stress.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-25886.s4" sec-type="Epidemiology">
        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>Night terrors are most often seen between the ages 3&#x000a0;to 7 years of age, and they often subside by 10 years of age. There appears to be an equal prevalence between boys and girls, with a prevalence of approximately 30% in children.</p>
        <p>Night terrors can occur in adults; however, it is rare.&#x000a0;This may indicate underlying neurologic disorders requiring more workup and investigation.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-25886.s5" sec-type="Pathophysiology">
        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>No consistent reason to explain night terror is available. No biochemical or structural abnormality is found in the brain. It has been suggested that levels of serotonin or its precursor may be linked. Thus, SSRIs are often prescribed for night terrors. There is a strong association between sleepwalking and night terrors; in addition, there is a high familial risk.</p>

        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>Episodes of night terrors most often occur in the first third of the night during slow non-rapid eye movement sleep when the child is in the transitional state of being wakeful and sleeping. This particular period is referred to as the arousal state.</p>
        <p>Episodes can appear to be very dramatic in presentation, with the child screaming and thrashing without realizing their surroundings. Children may show signs of excessive autonomic activity, such as tachycardia, tachypnea, mydriasis, and excessive sweating. In some cases, enuresis can also occur.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, children often do not respond to verbal cues, being comforted, or attempts to awaken. It is extremely difficult to wake these children in the middle of an episode. These spells can last approximately 10 to 20 minutes, and then the child&#x000a0;will abruptly return to sleep. Most do not recall the episodes.</p>

      <sec id="article-25886.s7" sec-type="Evaluation">
        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>No specific test must be done in an&#x000a0;emergent clinical setting to make the diagnosis. A night terror is a clinical diagnosis that can be determined by taking a careful history,&#x000a0;especially detailing the actual episode from families and witnesses. The only lab work or imaging that needs to be done is to rule out other differential diagnoses listed below.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25886.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25886.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25886.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>In some children, EEG studies or polysomnography may be required to rule out seizures. Patients with nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy can present in a similar fashion.</p>

There are developing therapies to encourage scheduled awakenings to prevent further episodes.</p>

        <p>The diagnosis and management of night terrors is complex and requires an interprofessional team that includes the pediatrician, nurse practitioner, social worker, primary care provider, and neurologist. Once diagnosed, there is no specific treatment for night terrors other than comforting the child. Reassurance and education for the parents or guardians are strongly encouraged, especially to ensure the safety of the child during a night terror. Parents should be educated about safety measures, including secure windows. Limiting access to the potentially harmful location in the home and outside.</p>
        <p>If there is excessive stress or conflict in the child&#x02019;s life, a combination of therapy and coping techniques can be recommended to help decrease the frequency of episodes. Medication administration is strongly discouraged and not indicated.</p>
