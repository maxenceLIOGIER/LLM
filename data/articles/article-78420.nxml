        <p>The nasal vasculature encountered in nonsurgical rhinoplasty derives from the internal and external carotid systems, primarily through terminal branches of the ophthalmic and facial arteries. Although there are varying branching patterns, particularly within the facial artery and anastomoses between the 2 systems, the following categorization offers a foundational overview of the relatively consistent vasculature encountered during nonsurgical rhinoplasty.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-78420.r3">[3]</xref></p>

        <title>Indications</title>
        <p>Nonsurgical rhinoplasty is indicated for correcting mild cosmetic deficits of the nose in patients who cannot undergo surgery or those looking to avoid the higher cost, downtime, and risks associated with traditional surgical rhinoplasty. From a logical standpoint, patients who benefit from nonsurgical rhinoplasty are similar to those patients who would benefit from specific cartilage grafts placed during surgical rhinoplasty (eg, shield grafts, tip grafts, radix grafts, onlay grafts, rim grafts), though often more subtle changes are desired. With that in mind, nonsurgical rhinoplasty using fillers may be useful in addressing the following:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Low or deep radix</p>

        <p>Of note, some propose that strategically placed filler may also provide functional improvements (ie, filler simulates spreader, butterfly, or batten grafts), though this remains controversial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-78420.r19">[19]</xref>&#x000a0;The patient should understand that while nonsurgical rhinoplasty has its appeal, an equally safe, reliable, and permanent alternative exists in a properly executed surgical rhinoplasty. Thus, all patients seeking nonsurgical rhinoplasty should also receive a consult for definitive surgical rhinoplasty.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-78420.s5" sec-type="Contraindications">
        <title>Contraindications</title>
        <p>Clinicians performing nonsurgical rhinoplasty must adeptly discern cases better suited for surgical intervention. Generally, nonsurgical rhinoplasty yields limited results for patients with pronounced humps, severe deviation, excessive tip rotation issues, or substantial tip contour irregularities. Instead, surgical correction should be recommended for patients seeking hump reduction, particularly those with a higher-positioned nasion. Convey to patients that "nasal reduction" cannot be achieved with fillers. However, techniques like dorsal augmentation and tip projection can create the illusion of a slimmer or more refined nose. This underscores the essential need for managing patient expectations during the consultation process.</p>
        <p>Contraindications to fillers, in general, include patients with a history of autoimmune disease, bleeding disorders, and hypersensitivity to 1 of the filler components (eg, lidocaine). Patients with signs of inflammation or infection near the injection site and those who are pregnant or breastfeeding should also avoid receiving injectable fillers. Patients with frequent herpes simplex virus outbreaks (eg, several outbreaks per year) should receive prophylactic antivirals.</p>
        <p>Nonsurgical rhinoplasty should be avoided in patients who have had previous nonsurgical rhinoplasty with either silicone or an unknown injection material.</p>
        <p>Patients with suspected or known body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) should receive a referral to psychiatry before considering nonsurgical rhinoplasty because they tend to have poor satisfaction following such procedures and show a higher rate of aggression and litigation toward those performing them. BDD may be prevalent in up to 43% of patients who present for a cosmetic rhinoplasty consultation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-78420.r20">[20]</xref></p>
        <p>Relative contraindications to undergoing nonsurgical rhinoplasty with fillers include patients actively taking anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs due to increased risk of bleeding and bruising. Similarly, patients taking herbal medications and supplements such as chondroitin, ephedra, echinacea, glucosamine, ginkgo biloba, goldenseal, milk thistle, ginseng, kava, and garlic should withhold these supplements for several days before and after treatment to minimize complications (eg, bleeding and bruising). Additionally, caution is necessary for patients with a history of nasal implants or previous rhinoplasty for fear of increased complications, including infection and tissue ischemia. For this reason, some authors propose waiting 12 months after a rhinoplasty to perform injections.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-78420.r21">[21]</xref></p>

        <p>
<bold>Filler Selection</bold>
</p>
        <p>The primary fillers employed in nonsurgical rhinoplasty are hyaluronic acid (HA) and calcium hydroxyapatite (CaHa), with HA being the more prevalent choice. Despite various product iterations for both HA and CaHa, selecting the appropriate filler hinges on several critical features. Notably, the filler's reversibility, duration, and stiffness are pivotal considerations. Additional practical factors may influence selection, such as regional availability and specific material accessibility based on the patient's country of residence. For a complete discussion of the types of filler available for injectable rhinoplasty, readers can read the review article by Friedman and Wang.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-78420.r22">[22]</xref></p>
        <p>The safest fillers are undoubtedly biodegradable and reversible, exemplified by HA fillers that dissolve easily and rapidly with hyaluronidase. This reversibility enhances safety, particularly concerning potential vascular occlusion events, and allows for the dissolution of overfilled or misplaced injections.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the filler's longevity must factor into selection. Generally, HA fillers offer 6 to 12 months of effectiveness, while CaHa fillers may persist for 12 to 18 months, potentially longer, due to collagen synthesis after repeated treatments. Counseling patients that maintaining the effects of nonsurgical rhinoplasty necessitates periodic injections, regardless of filler type, is vital.</p>
        <p>Another pivotal filler attribute is the elastic coefficient, denoted as G-prime, which reflects the filler's resistance to deformation or stiffness. High G-prime fillers like CaHa resist deformation, offering robust "filling" effects with less product. However, they may induce more post-procedural edema and discomfort and may feel less natural than low G-prime options like HA.</p>
        <p>Permanent fillers, such as silicone and polymethylmethacrylate, are best avoided due to the risk of granulomas and irreversible complications, including vascular injury.</p>
        <p>The optimal filler for nonsurgical rhinoplasty generally combines reversibility, ease of injection, and enduring support for the nose. HA is favored by approximately 80% of practitioners due to its non-inflammatory nature and minimal tissue distortion. However, some proponents endorse CaHa for its extended duration, moldability, and increased stiffness. The choice ultimately hinges on individual patient needs and preferences.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-78420.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Cannula vs Needle Injection Techniques</bold>
</p>
        <p>In theory, employing a small blunt cannula (eg, 27-gauge) for nonsurgical rhinoplasty may lower the risk of vascular occlusion. However, despite the use of a cannula, instances of tissue ischemia and blindness have been reported. The advantage of using a cannula becomes apparent when injecting larger, flatter areas like dorsal augmentation, minimizing local tissue trauma and enhancing efficiency by reducing injection points.

        <p>Regardless of the chosen technique (cannula or needle), the focus should remain on proper injection methods. This includes injecting into an avascular sub-SMAS plane, regular aspiration to confirm intravascular needle/cannula placement, gradual injection, and administering small filler aliquots, not exceeding 0.1 mL at each site.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-78420.r17">[17]</xref></p>

        <title>Technique or Treatment</title>
        <p>Before exploring the technical intricacies of nonsurgical rhinoplasty, it is crucial to emphasize adherence to safe injection techniques; this involves injecting into an avascular sub-SMAS plane, maintaining midline placement to prevent asymmetries, aspirating to confirm intravascular needle/cannula location, injecting gradually with small filler aliquots, and minimizing injection sites. Using a blunt-tipped cannula may enhance safety by reducing the risk of intravascular injection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-78420.r26">[26]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-78420.r17">[17]</xref>&#x000a0;Employing 2 hands, 1 for injecting and the other for stabilizing, pinching, or molding, can contribute to safe, consistent outcomes.</p>
        <p>The approach to nonsurgical rhinoplasty is relatively uncomplicated and relies on incremental enhancements to the cartilage and bony framework of the nose. However, multiple techniques exist, varying in filler choice, injection sequence, specific injection methods (eg, droplet, threading, subcision necessity), filler placement, and volume requirements.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-78420.r21">[21]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-78420.r22">[22]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-78420.r26">[26]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-78420.r27">[27]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-78420.r28">[28]</xref>&#x000a0;Regardless of the chosen technique, consistent and satisfactory results are achievable by applying safe injection practices and a treatment plan rooted in anatomical principles. For clinicians with surgical rhinoplasty training, a graft-based approach, where the filler replicates the effects of a similarly positioned cartilage graft, represents an intuitive choice.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-78420.r21">[21]</xref></p>
        <p>Listed here are several areas that can be addressed with nonsurgical rhinoplasty, as are the key maneuvers required to produce safe and reliable results:</p>
        <p><bold>Radix/dorsal augmentation</bold>: First, the desired height of the radix and dorsum is determined, as well as the amount of supratip break, if any. Using a 30-gauge needle, fill the selected areas of the radix and/or dorsum with droplets precisely placed in the midline at a 90-degree angle. Alternatively, dorsal augmentation is achievable using a cannula introduced via the supratip and advanced in a sub-SMAS plane up to the height of the desired augmentation but not beyond the nasion. The cannula's bevel should face downward, and the filler should be injected retrogradely. To avoid vascular occlusion, lift the skin upward, and some authors recommend placing a finger above the radix to hinder superior filler migration. Typically, 0.5 mL of filler is suitable for full dorsal augmentation, with immediate massage and molding for a smooth contour. Some authors advocate that dorsal augmentation with HA requires slight overcorrection to account for the immediate post-injection edema. If significant overcorrection occurs during the procedure, this can usually be addressed with molding and massage.</p>
        <p><bold>Dorsal convexity (hump) camouflage</bold>: The illusion of hump reduction is a relatively straightforward maneuver achieved by strategically augmenting the midline dorsum with a few precise needle injections placed cephalad and/or caudad to the existing dorsal convexity. An amount of 0.2 mL per injection site is typical. As with dorsal augmentation, radix height and supratip break must be determined before injecting.</p>
        <p><bold>Straightening the crooked nose</bold>: Just as surgically placed onlay grafts and asymmetric spreader grafts help to straighten a crooked nose, so too does carefully placed filler along the dorsum and nasal sidewall provide camouflage to contour irregularities of the mid to upper third of the nose. Particular caution is needed when injecting the nose's lateral region due to the vascular arcade. Avoid direct injection around the alar groove to prevent intravascular injection of the lateral nasal artery. Some clinicians prefer midline injections, using massage and molding to distribute the filler laterally as needed.</p>
        <p><bold>Premaxillary deficiency</bold>: Besides the evident alar base disparity, premaxillary asymmetry can lead to tip asymmetry and alar-columellar discrepancies, including ipsilateral ala retraction. Similar to applying a premaxillary graft in surgical rhinoplasty, the filler can be strategically placed under the alar base to rectify this asymmetry. The filler should be injected deeply on the maxilla, employing a medial position to mitigate the risk of vascular complications. Our preferred technique for injecting in this region involves using a cannula for enhanced precision and safety.</p>
        <p><bold>Tip projection</bold>: Similar to the impact of various tip-projecting grafts in surgical rhinoplasty (eg, tip graft, shield graft, and caudal septal extension grafts), filler can also enhance tip projection. Safe tip injection techniques include placing very small aliquots of filler in a location corresponding to the desired tip-defining point. The clinician can choose an infratip or supratip approach based on their experience. In either case, injecting the filler at the depth of the perichondrium is essential. Injection between the domes should be avoided to prevent unintended dome splaying and inadvertent tip widening. If augmentation of the infratip lobule is necessary, an additional filler can be strategically placed to mimic a shield graft. Moreover, careful filler placement in the supratip area can modify the contour, catering to the desired supratip break. Supratip augmentation should always follow tip projection maneuvers to mitigate the iatrogenic polly beak deformity risk.</p>
        <p><bold>Tip rotation</bold>: Enhancing tip rotation through fillers represents an advanced technique in nonsurgical rhinoplasty, offering several approaches. Firstly, the illusion of increased rotation can be achieved by blunting the nasolabial angle with a deep injection placed at the subnasale along the anterior nasal spine. Typically, around 0.5 mL of filler is adequate for this purpose. Secondly, deep filler injection in the intercolumnar space between the medial crura footplates adjacent to the posterior septal angle (PSA) acts as a columellar strut. As Anderson described, this lengthens the nasal tripod's central leg, increasing tip rotation and projection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-78420.r29">[29]</xref>&#x000a0;The injection along the PSA can also encourage the anterior displacement of the medial crural footplates, which can rectify a retracted columella but may accentuate existing columellar show. Usually, 0.2 to 0.3 mL of filler in the columellar space is sufficient. Pinching the membranous septum during injection in the columella and nasal spine area helps maintain the filler midline; this prevents migration into the nasal cavity, reducing the risk of nasal obstruction.</p>
        <p><bold>Alar rim contouring</bold>: Just as a rim graft can influence the ala's contour, filler can be employed along the alar rim to address minor alar retraction or asymmetry. Caution is essential when injecting the alar rims in patients with a history of previous rhinoplasty because the postoperative blood supply remains rather tenuous due to prior marginal incisions, and the presence of scar tissue may complicate the intended injection planes and patterns.</p>
        <p><bold>Functional applications</bold>: As mentioned previously, injectable fillers placed into the scroll, internal nasal valve, alar rims, and nasal sidewall have been used to address nasal valve insufficiency by simulating the effects of various functional grafts (eg, spreaders, alar battens, butterfly grafts, strut grafts, alar rim grafts) or implants (eg, poly-L-lactic acid). This application of fillers in nonsurgical rhinoplasty, however, remains controversial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-78420.r19">[19]</xref></p>

        <p>&#x000a0;In the context of nonsurgical rhinoplasty with fillers, a range of skills, responsibilities, and interprofessional communication is paramount to ensure patient-centered care, optimize outcomes, enhance patient safety, and foster effective team performance. Physicians and advanced clinicians should employ their expertise to assess patients comprehensively, identify risk factors and contraindications, and select the most suitable candidates for both surgical and nonsurgical rhinoplasty. Interprofessional collaboration is essential, involving clinicians experienced in the procedure and support staff. Nurses play a crucial role in patient preparation, intra-procedural assistance, and postprocedural monitoring, drawing on their expertise in post-procedural care. The nursing staff's coordination with clinicians ensures patients receive close follow-up to detect and manage potential complications, such as tissue ischemia and blindness. Effective patient education is another key responsibility, emphasizing proper post-procedural care to minimize complications. This collaborative and skillful approach enhances patient-centered care, ensures positive outcomes, promotes patient safety, and optimizes team performance throughout the nonsurgical rhinoplasty process.</p>

        <p>Pain is typically minimal following nonsurgical rhinoplasty, often requiring no pain medication. While bleeding is easily controlled with pressure, bruising is uncommon and self-limiting if it occurs. To reduce edema and potential complications, patients should refrain from excessive nasal manipulation, sleep with an elevated head, and avoid vigorous activities for 2 to 3 days. The use of preprocedural <italic toggle="yes">Arnica montana</italic> or bromelain may assist in minimizing bruising and swelling. A follow-up appointment at 1 to 2 weeks allows for the consideration of repeated injections if needed. Photographic documentation is recommended around 1 to 2 weeks postprocedure. Patients should be informed that results may endure for 9 to 18 months, depending on the filler type used, with the understanding that additional filler will eventually be necessary to sustain the results.</p>
