        <p>Coprolalia comes from the greek "kopros," which means "dung, feces" and "lalein," which means "to babble." It's a tic-like occurrence that involves non-intentional obscene and socially inappropriate vocalizations. In 10 to 33% of cases, it may correlate with tic disorders, in particular with Tourette syndrome (also known as Gilles de la Tourette syndrome). Gilles the la Tourette is believed to occur in approximately 1% of the population worldwide, in the range between 0.4% to 3.8%. Coprolalia also occurs in patients with brain lesions, "senility" and in those with neurodegenerative and autoimmune disorders. It has can also occur in association with seizure disorders, in ictal or post-ictal status. This activity outlines the identification, evaluation, and management of coprolalia.

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Coprolalia comes from the greek "kopros," which means "dung, feces" and "lalein," which means "to babble." It's a tic-like&#x000a0;occurrence&#x000a0;that involves non-intentional obscene and socially inappropriate vocalizations. In 10-33% of cases, it may correlate with tic disorders, in particular with Tourette syndrome (also known as Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome). Gilles the la Tourette is believed to occur in approximately 1% of the population worldwide, in the range between 0.4% to 3.8%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19973.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>Coprolalia also occurs in patients with brain lesions, "senility" and in those with neurodegenerative and autoimmune disorders. It can also appear in association with seizure disorders, in ictal or post-ictal status.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>There are also other vocal tic behaviors such as palilalia (involuntary repetition of words, phrases, or sentences), echolalia (repetition of another person's spoken words in a meaningless form), and klazomania (compulsive shouting) that can also be associated with coprolalia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19973.r2">[2]</xref>]<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19973.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>Coprolalia is the most common of the&#x000a0;coprophenomena, which includes copropraxia (the urge to perform obscene gestures without control), mental coprolalia (obscenities thought obsessively), and coprographia (the urge to write down those expressions or obscenities).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19973.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19973.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>There is very little information about coprolalia in the absence of Tourette syndrome. Therefore, much&#x000a0;of the information known about coprolalia&#x000a0;is in the context of Tourette's and occasionally other tic disorders.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-19973.s3" sec-type="Etiology">
        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>The functional neuroanatomical basis of coprolalia is unclear. Among the different hypotheses to explain it, is the belief that the limbic circuit could have an important role in the pathophysiology of coprolalic behaviors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19973.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>Other hypotheses have been constructed to explain the pathophysiology of&#x000a0;Tourette's that describe the development of tic (whether motor or phonatory) and coprolalia. One theory is that the brain regions that are involved in Tourette, which are the limbic system and basal ganglia, are equivalent to those of regions involved in reproductive behavior/sex control in primitive animals. Therefore tics and coprolalia could result from dysfunction in these regions and appear as primitive vocal and motor fragments.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Another hypothesis suggests that coprolalia is a part of the obsessive-compulsive disorder spectrum, which results from a failure to inhibit a part of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical pathway (which composes the basal ganglia).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19973.r3">[3]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-19973.s4" sec-type="Epidemiology">
        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>The prevalence of coprolalia is unclear, and it ranges from&#x000a0;very low to very high numbers in different series, but precise percentages are difficult to determine. Most&#x000a0;studies have shown a higher male-to-female ratio.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19973.r3">[3]</xref> The same&#x000a0;higher male to female ratio is also present for patients with Tourette, whose pathognomonic sign is coprolalia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19973.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19973.r6">[6]</xref> In Japan, the number of reported cases in tertiary university centers ranges from 27% to 39% compared to primary care practices, whose prevalence approaches approximately 8%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19973.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>In terms of tics, which coprolalia is a part of, they start to arise between the ages of 4 to 6 years old and increase in severity when closer to pre-adolescence (10 to 12 years old). The rates are also higher in Whites compared to Hispanics and African-Americans.</p>

        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>In general, the decision to treat tics or coprolalia depends on the level of impairment and how much distress it may cause to the child, and requires the cooperation of the family. After education about the condition peer-reviewed, sometimes, the decision may be to monitor it clinically, without the need for active intervention, which can be non-pharmacological or pharmacological.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Non-Pharmacologic Intervention</bold>
</p>
        <p>Behavioral therapy has demonstrated success in helping the patient manage their compulsive behaviors and is thought to help patients with coprolalia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19973.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>The treatment with the most robust empirical support that exists is habit reversal therapy (HRT), in which the patient can learn to recognize the signs that the urge is coming and become aware of it, as well as creating a response to these signs or the tic. Other behavioral treatments that have been found efficacious in clinical trials include&#x000a0;comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics (CBIT), and exposure-response prevention (ERP).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19973.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Pharmacologic Interventions</bold>
</p>
        <p>The pharmacologic treatment of coprolalia in itself is rarely&#x000a0;addressed directly in the literature. It is almost always found together with&#x000a0;the treatment of tics (whether motor or phonatory), obsessive-compulsive disorder, impulsivity, and other conditions,&#x000a0;including Tourette syndrome.&#x000a0;</p>

        <p>Symptoms of coprolalia wax and wane over time and for no particular evident reason.

        <p>Tourette syndrome and associated tics (such as coprolalia) can impact school performance in children in different ways, whether it is by interfering with studying, paying attention in class, and making it stressful for the child to be in the class. The stress of the classroom can make tics worse. The teachers may wrongly discipline them, or they may experience bullying by their classmates. All of which can lead to a decrease in academic performance and social isolation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19973.r15">[15]</xref></p>
        <p>Special education services are often recommended. Educational support is available with a 504 modification&#x000a0;plan&#x000a0;(75% of kids with Tourette syndrome are given classroom accommodations, like being able to leave the classroom as needed, or ignoring their tics). And when the students have educational needs, these recommendations are included in the individualized education plan.</p>
        <p>Primary care providers&#x000a0;should offer&#x000a0;referring individuals with coprolalia or Tourette to a behavioral or developmental specialist for further support&#x000a0;and management.</p>
        <p>Diagnosing and managing coprolalia requires the efforts of an interprofessional team. When the clinician suspects a condition associated with coprolalia, they should immediately enlist a psychiatric specialist. In the event pharmaceutical treatment is part of the treatment plan, and board-certified psychiatric pharmacist can provide additional direction on pharmaceutical care, including agent selection, dosing, and medication reconciliation. Psychiatric health nurses can assist in monitoring, counseling the patient and family, and assessing treatment progress and effectiveness. Social workers can interact with school officials and teachers to ensure the provision of proper accommodations there. In this manner, an open, communicating, interprofessional healthcare team can direct patient outcomes to optimal results. [Level V]</p>
