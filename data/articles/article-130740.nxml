        <p>Alcohol and substance abuse pose significant challenges within Native American communities, necessitating culturally sensitive approaches to evaluation and treatment. Alaska Natives and American Indians comprise&#x000a0;2 diverse populations with distinct variations in alcohol and substance abuse rates due to geographic location and tribal affiliation.&#x000a0;These populations face unique socioeconomic, historical, and cultural factors that influence patterns of substance use. Effective interventions must integrate traditional healing practices with evidence-based treatments, respecting cultural norms and values to promote holistic wellness. Understanding these complexities is crucial for developing targeted strategies that address the root causes and provide comprehensive support for individuals and communities affected by alcohol and substance abuse.</p>
        <p>This activity describes the etiology, epidemiology, specialized evaluation, and treatment approaches for alcohol and substance abuse among Native Americans. Participants gain practical knowledge and skills that enable them to provide more effective care tailored to the unique needs of&#x000a0;this vulnerable population. Learners understand that prevention and early identification and treatment of substance use disorders are necessary to lower morbidity and mortality in these patients and communities. This activity also highlights the role of an interprofessional healthcare team in&#x000a0;enhancing and applying culturally competent care.&#x000a0;</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Alaska Natives and American Indians constitute diverse and heterogeneous communities. Based on the 2010 consensus, this population represents over 560 federally recognized tribes and comprises over 2.9 million people.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Moreover, when considering Alaska Natives and American Indians who identify with multiple racial backgrounds, the total population exceeds 5.2 million individuals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>For centuries, it has been commonly thought that Native Americans have higher rates of alcohol consumption compared to White individuals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;In a statement from the United States government, ethnologist HR Schoolcraft declared, &#x0201c;It is strange how all the Indian nations, and almost every person among them, male and female, are infatuated with the love of a strong drink. They know no bounds to their desire&#x0201d;.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>One of the many shortcomings of these uninformed, racist stereotypes is examining both Alaska Natives and American Indians together as a distinct population. Alaska Natives and American Indians exhibit&#x000a0;numerous differences within their populations&#x02014;with many tribes having distinct languages, cultures, and customs.&#x000a0;These differences also include vastly different alcohol and substance usage patterns, which vary by geographic location and tribe.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r1">[1]</xref> Thus, studying subgroups of Alaska Natives and Native Americans and applying data to the entire population is easily susceptible to misinterpretation and overgeneralization.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r5">[5]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-130740.s3" sec-type="Etiology">
        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>In Alaska Native and American Indian populations, environmental and genetic risk factors contribute substantially to substance and alcohol use disorder. Genetically, concerning alcohol use disorder, some populations of Alaska Natives and American Indians are less likely than other ethnic groups to carry the protective variation of genes that produce the enzymes to metabolize alcohol, including alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;These protective genes, found at specific alleles such as ADH1B, ADH1C, and ALDH2, lead individuals who consume alcohol to experience elevated levels of acetaldehyde in their bloodstream.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;The increased acetaldehyde levels cause increased blood flow, increased heart rate, dizziness, sweating, and nausea, or what is commonly known as a "flushing response," which may be interpreted as a warning sign.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;The individuals lacking these genes are often, then, less protected from the undesirable&#x000a0;adverse effects that occur with the initial alcohol consumption.</p>
        <p>Alaska Natives and American Indians are susceptible to the same environmental risk factors for alcohol and substance&#x000a0;use disorders found in all populations: a family history of substance abuse, specific personality characteristics, psychiatric comorbidities, gender, and trauma exposure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;However, they also experience additional risk factors unique to their population. These include the historically documented emotional and psychological trauma that resulted from cultural genocide and the elimination of a cultural group's foundation and core beliefs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Economic factors, such as poverty and unemployment rates higher than the national average, contribute to stressors that may lead to substance use as a coping mechanism. Moreover, historical and cultural ties to the land and traditional practices can influence substance use patterns, with some communities experiencing higher rates of alcohol-related issues due to factors like isolation, lack of economic opportunities, and historical trauma.</p>
        <p>Another factor influencing the rates of alcohol and&#x000a0;substance use disorders within the American Indian and Alaska Native populations is their community's acceptance of recreational substances. Many reservations often capitalize on selling cigarettes and alcohol at a lower cost due to the lower tax rates found on tribal reservations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r1">[1]</xref> This allows easier availability and access to these products, decreasing the success rates among individuals who attempt to quit smoking and drinking. Some tribes have enacted strict laws that prohibit the possession and/or sale of alcohol on the reservation to counter this. A strong protective factor unique to the Alaska Native and American Indian populations is their deep-rooted sense of family, tribal affiliation, and spirituality. These factors can significantly increase the success rate of substance&#x000a0;use disorder prevention and treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r4">[4]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-130740.s4" sec-type="Epidemiology">
        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>Epidemiological data regarding the alcohol and substance&#x000a0;use disorder rates among Alaska Native and American Indian populations demonstrate a complex pattern with significant variation between studies. Today, the majority of Alaska Native and American Indians reside in urban or suburban areas.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Due to the federal government efforts in the mid-twentieth century, which forced Alaska Native and American Indian assimilation, many tribes are now dispersed. This makes research and sampling among Alaska Native and American Indian populations very complicated. The commonly used national probability samples based on United States (US) residential patterns have led to skewed results. As a result of this challenge, much of the research performed among Alaska Native and American Indians is conducted on tribal reservations.&#x000a0;Thus, it captures only a small portion of the entire population, not a representative sample.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>According to the Tri-Ethnic Center, Alaska Native, and American Indian adolescents demonstrate higher rates of tobacco, alcohol, and substance use and earlier initiation when compared to other adolescents in the US.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;The highest rates were documented in those who had dropped out of school and lived&#x000a0;on a reservation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0; In contrast, another study that examined&#x000a0;4 Alaska Native and American Indian reservations reported increased 30-day use of substances among adolescents. However, the increased use was eliminated when the results were stratified by geographic location.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Alaska Natives and American Indians both provide community support for impaired adolescents with targeted programs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>In Alaska Native and American Indian adults, the same picture of variation exists between tribal communities and geographic locations. A joint study published by the National Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Study and American Indian Service Utilization, Psychiatric Epidemiology, and Risk and Protective Factors Project showed Alaska Native and American Indians who lived in urban or suburban areas consumed alcohol more frequently than those who lived on a reservation. Still, another study showed that alcohol use rates were lower in Alaska Native and American Indian adults than other Americans, but among those Alaska Native and American Indian who <italic toggle="yes">did</italic> drink, there was heavier episodic use.&#x000a0;In Alaska Native and American Indian adults, tobacco use rates were higher,&#x000a0;but&#x000a0;substance use rates were found to be equivalent to other&#x000a0;US adults.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r1">[1]</xref></p>

        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>The history and physical examination findings identified among Alaska Native and American Indian populations are similar to findings among other ethnic groups. Primary care physicians utilize screening tools to identify individuals who may already have an alcohol or substance&#x000a0;use disorder or individuals who are at increased risk for developing such a disorder. Two commonly used screening tools are the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and the CAGE-AID questionnaire.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Screening every individual is necessary because selective screening can result in missed opportunities for intervention. Physical exam findings of substance and alcohol use disorders&#x000a0;may be absent or very subtle.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;Although screening tests are a useful tool, they rely on truthful and accurate reporting from the patient. Subjective screening questions include a history of alcohol and substance use, how often and how much is consumed, any negative health or personal consequences relating to alcohol and substance use, and the impact on their friends and family and other personal and professional relationships. Physical signs and symptoms of excessive or problematic substance use may include a recent weight loss or weight gain, frequent falls or accidents, psychological disturbances, and sleep disturbances.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Alcohol withdrawal symptoms can include tremors, shakes, psychosis, and seizures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;Other adverse events of long-term alcohol use can include pancreatitis, fatty liver, and, in later stages, jaundice, ascites, hepatomegaly, spider angiomas, gynecomastia, and cirrhosis. Specifically, in adolescents, some risk factors that should prompt further evaluation and assessment of alcohol and substance&#x000a0;use disorders include a drastic change in physical appearance, marked personality changes, decreased performance in school work or job performance, engaging in criminal behavior, or severe psychological instability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r9">[9]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-130740.s6" sec-type="Evaluation">
        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>Laboratory testing can help to determine the existence and extent of alcohol and substance abuse. These tests include urine, blood, saliva, hair, and breath&#x000a0;analysis to detect substance use. Similarly, physicians can order serum alcohol levels, ethyl glucuronide levels in the urine, and phosphatidyl ethanol levels in the blood. There are also a myriad of testing options that can help&#x000a0;detect&#x000a0;drug or alcohol use. Chronic alcohol use can cause an increase in liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), with a 2:1 characteristic pattern, respectively. Macrocytic anemia, elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase&#x000a0;(GGT) levels and increased prothrombin time are other commonly associated findings associated with alcohol abuse. Healthcare professionals can use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria to evaluate whether an individual meets the criteria for alcohol and substance use disorders.&#x000a0;Additionally, evaluating the presence of co-occurring disorders such as anxiety, depression, or trauma is crucial, as these often intersect with substance abuse.&#x000a0;</p>

        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>Alcohol and substance use disorders can have many adverse events that affect American Indian and Native American&#x02019;s health, relationships, and even employment status. American Indians and Alaska Natives, when compared with non-Hispanic White individuals, were found to be 41% more likely to seek treatment for alcohol abuse.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;The treatment of alcohol and substance use in Alaska Natives and American Indians requires culturally sensitive and community-specific approaches that respect traditional healing practices. Effective treatment strategies often involve a combination of behavioral therapies, medical interventions, and peer support programs tailored to meet the diverse needs and cultural backgrounds of these populations.&#x000a0;Various pharmacological therapies specific to the substance being used can also be utilized.</p>
        <p>Motivational&#x000a0;interviewing has been used successfully to treat alcohol and substance use disorders in these populations because it aligns with Alaska Native and American Indian culture and values. Motivational interviewing, an evidence-based treatment, is a patient-focused technique that consists of both a relational and technical approach.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;The relational segment consists of the interviewer establishing a rapport with the patient through compassion, empathy, and accentuation of patient autonomy. The technical approach allows patients to discuss their motivation for change and reinforce their decision.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Healthcare professionals must collaborate closely with tribal leaders, community elders, and culturally competent counselors to ensure that interventions respect indigenous values and beliefs. By fostering trust and understanding within the community, treatment programs can enhance engagement and improve outcomes, supporting individuals and families in their journey toward recovery and wellness. Geography significantly influences alcohol and substance use among Native Americans, shaping both access to resources and patterns of use. Remote and rural communities often face limited access to healthcare facilities, including substance abuse treatment centers, which can hinder timely intervention and support for Native individuals struggling with addiction. Future treatment models must address access to care in all geographical areas.</p>

        <p>Deterrence and patient education efforts for alcohol and substance abuse among Alaska Natives and American Indians are pivotal in addressing these issues within culturally relevant contexts. These initiatives emphasize proactive strategies aimed at preventing substance misuse through community-based education, awareness campaigns, and early intervention programs. By integrating traditional knowledge and values into educational materials and outreach efforts, healthcare professionals can effectively engage individuals and families in discussions about the risks of substance abuse and the benefits of healthy lifestyles. Empowering communities with knowledge about the impact of alcohol and drugs, as well as providing resources for seeking help, supports informed decision-making and fosters a collective commitment to promoting wellness and reducing substance-related harm.</p>
        <p>Alaska Natives and American Indians&#x000a0;should be encouraged to fully utilize their support system, including their family, friends, peers, and the entire tribal community, to help them adhere to their treatment plan.

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>Alcohol and substance&#x000a0;use disorders are very complex and challenging problems within the American Indian and Native Alaska populations. One key strategy for reducing alcohol and substance&#x000a0;use disorders and improving healthcare outcomes is to develop strong partnerships between multidisciplinary&#x000a0;healthcare team members, tribes, tribal leaders, and academic researchers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r17">[17]</xref>&#x000a0;Essential skills&#x000a0;include performing culturally competent assessments, understanding the unique historical and socioeconomic factors influencing substance use, and employing evidence-based treatment modalities tailored to individual and community needs. Strategic approaches involve developing comprehensive care plans that integrate traditional healing practices with modern medical interventions, fostering trust and adherence to treatment among patients. Ethical considerations emphasize respect for indigenous values, confidentiality, and the avoidance of stigmatization in care delivery.</p>
        <p>The healthcare team's responsibilities encompass advocating for resources and policies that support addiction treatment and prevention in Native communities. Interprofessional communication ensures seamless collaboration among physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals. Effective care coordination involves linking patients with community support services, mental health resources, and substance abuse treatment facilities, promoting continuity of care and long-term recovery.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Another successful strategy healthcare&#x000a0;team members can implement is the development of preventative and treatment plans that are culturally based and designed specifically for the unique culture of a particular tribe. Finally, an effort to reduce the cultural and social stigma associated with alcohol and substance use disorder treatment is vitally important to helping Native Alaskans and American Indians feel comfortable seeking healthcare, thus driving optimal outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130740.r18">[18]</xref>&#x000a0;Healthcare systems should ensure adequate training for providers in Native American health issues and support research initiatives that prioritize understanding and addressing the unique challenges these communities face. Through this collaboration, alcohol and substance-related healthcare disparities and the high rates of morbidity and mortality can be reduced by future research projects and healthcare initiatives.</p>
