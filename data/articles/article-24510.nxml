        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Lung transplantation is a well-established, life-saving treatment designed to improve the quality of life for patients suffering from end-stage respiratory failure unresponsive to other medical or surgical interventions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24510.r1">[1]</xref> The significance of this procedure is underscored by data from the&#x000a0;thirty-sixth&#x000a0;adult lung and heart-lung transplant report, which summarizes information from 69,200 adult lung transplants performed up to June 30, 2018, and recorded in the International Thoracic Organ Transplant Registry.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24510.r2">[2]</xref> According to the United States Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network and the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, the survival rates for lung transplant recipients are 85% at 1 year, 68% at 3 years, and 55% at 5 years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24510.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The field of lung transplantation has continually evolved, increasing both in application and success. In 1963, Dr James Hardy and colleagues at the University of Mississippi performed the first lung transplant. Despite the recipient having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and being a suboptimal candidate due to advanced lung cancer and renal insufficiency, this pioneering procedure paved the way for future developments.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24510.r4">[4]</xref> The first successful combined heart and lung transplant followed in 1981, marking another significant milestone in the history of transplant surgery.</p>
        <p>Over the past&#x000a0;6 decades, lung transplantation has seen remarkable advancements. This growth has been particularly notable over the last 10 years, driven by donor utilization and procurement innovations. The number of lung transplants has increased, and outcomes have improved due to advancements in medical and surgical management, as well as microbiological and immunological care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24510.r5">[5]</xref> These developments have expanded the pool of eligible recipients and enhanced the success rates and overall prognosis for patients undergoing lung transplantation.</p>

        <title>Anatomy and Physiology</title>
        <p>The lungs are paired organs, consisting of the right and left lung, each with distinct anatomical features and functions. The mainstem bronchus of the right and left lung join at the carina to form the central trachea. Each lung has&#x000a0;3 surfaces&#x02014;the costal, medial, and inferior (or diaphragmatic) surfaces. Enclosing each lung is a serous membrane known as the pleura, which has&#x000a0;2 layers&#x02014;the outer parietal pleura and the inner visceral pleura. The right lung is typically shorter and broader than the left, which occupies a smaller volume.</p>
        <p>Anatomically, the right lung is divided into&#x000a0;3 lobes&#x02014;the upper, middle, and lower lobes. In contrast, the left lung consists of only&#x000a0;2 lobes&#x02014;the upper and lower lobes, with the lingula being part of the upper lobe. The right lung features a horizontal fissure that separates the upper and middle lobes and an oblique fissure that divides the middle and lower lobes. The left lung contains a single oblique fissure that separates the upper and lower lobes.</p>
        <p>Each lobe of the lungs is subdivided into individual, structurally, and functionally independent units called bronchopulmonary segments. There are 18 bronchopulmonary segments: 10 in the right lung and 8 in the left lung. Each segment is served by its own artery, segmental bronchus, autonomic nerves, and lymph vessels.</p>
        <p>The hilum, or root of the lung, is situated on the medial side where the visceral and parietal pleurae meet, serving as the entry and exit point for the pulmonary vasculature and bronchi. The pulmonary arteries, 1 for each lung, transport deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs. In contrast, the 4 pulmonary veins carry oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left side of the heart. During a recipient pneumonectomy, it is crucial to accurately identify, dissect, transect, and staple each of these structures.</p>
        <p>Lung resections can be categorized into anatomical and nonanatomical types, depending on the extent of the lung removed. Anatomical resections include procedures such as segmentectomy, lobectomy, or pneumonectomy, whereas nonanatomical resections include wedge resection.</p>
        <p>Lungs suitable for transplantation are typically harvested from either brain-dead donors or after the declaration of circulatory death. Traditionally, these lungs have been preserved using cold static preservation methods, where the organs are kept on ice until they are transferred to the recipient hospital. However, the availability of ideal lung donors is limited, and recent findings have shown that cold static preservation can lead to exaggerated ischemia-reperfusion injury.</p>
        <p>Now, lungs are often transported in a normothermic perfused condition to address these challenges. This advancement has been made possible by the development of ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP). EVLP is a technique that enables the transportation, evaluation, and reconditioning of donor lungs in a normothermic state, reducing ischemia-reperfusion injury and enhancing the overall quality and viability of transplanted organs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24510.r6">[6]</xref></p>

        <title>Indications</title>
        <p>Careful consideration of recipient selection is vital to mitigate risks and optimize patient outcomes. Timing is crucial for referral and listing for transplantation. To qualify for a lung transplant, a patient must be at a stage where they require the procedure while also being medically fit enough to undergo it. The Lung Allocation Score (LAS) helps prioritize patients to improve outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24510.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;The LAS comprises 12 physiological and demographic factors proven to influence mortality in individuals with advanced lung disease. LAS is determined by subtracting the predicted 1-year survival without transplant from the predicted 1-year survival with transplant, then normalizing the score to a range of 0 to 100.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24510.r8">[8]</xref> Organs are allocated to patients with the highest scores before those with lower scores. Studies have demonstrated that LAS outperforms clinical judgment in predicting waitlist mortality, with a hazard ratio of 1.06 per unit increase in LAS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24510.r9">[9]</xref></p>

        <p>A growing body of data supports extracorporeal life support (ECLS) as a significant tool for managing primary graft dysfunction (PGD) following lung transplantation. The role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is expanding in PGD prevention and management, worldwide outcomes of&#x000a0;lung transplantation&#x000a0;with ECLS support, and managing complex respiratory syndrome leading up to the institution of ECLS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24510.r14">[14]</xref>&#x000a0;A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is essential for assessing right ventricular function and pulmonary hypertension, which are significant factors in the aggressive use of ECLS preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively.</p>
        <p>EVLP has emerged as a promising solution to address the scarcity of donor organs. EVLP facilitates the evaluation and potential improvement of marginal donor lungs and mitigates risks associated with prolonged ischemic times due to logistical constraints. EVLP systems approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have shown favorable outcomes in clinical trials. Retrospective studies indicate that posttransplant survival rates for recipients of marginal donor lungs perfused using EVLP are comparable to those for recipients of standard criteria lungs preserved conventionally. Despite these promising results, the widespread adoption of EVLP has plateaued in recent years, primarily due to the substantial costs associated with establishing EVLP programs.</p>
        <p>In preclinical research, ongoing studies are investigating potential applications of EVLP, such as extending organ preservation duration, improving the condition of initially unsuitable lungs, and enhancing the quality of already suitable lungs. As EVLP technology becomes more widespread, these potential applications may eventually be integrated into clinical practice, further expanding the donor organ pool and improving lung transplantation outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24510.r15">[15]</xref></p>

        <title>Technique or Treatment</title>
        <p>
<bold>Lung Transplant Technique</bold>
</p>
        <p>All recipient patients undergoing lung transplantation receive general anesthesia through a double-lumen endotracheal tube, which allows for the isolation and ventilation of each lung separately. A triple-lumen central venous catheter is inserted into the neck to provide access for medication administration, fluid management, and central venous pressure monitoring. Additionally, most centers place femoral vascular access to facilitate rapid percutaneous cannulation to initiate ECMO support if necessary. The venous catheter must be inserted on the left side to accommodate potential postprocedure ECMO needs.</p>
        <p>A Swan-Ganz catheter is also inserted to monitor pulmonary artery pressures, providing critical information on the patient's hemodynamic status. TEE is invaluable due to the close interrelation between heart and lung function during lung transplantation. TEE enables real-time monitoring of the physiopathological situation throughout the procedure, helping guide the surgical team through the various stages of the intervention and ensuring optimal patient outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24510.r17">[17]</xref></p>
        <p>During a lung transplant procedure, the patient is placed in a supine position and prepped from the neck to the knee. For a single lung transplant, an anterolateral thoracotomy is performed, while bilateral lung transplants are traditionally done using a clamshell incision with sternal splitting. More recently, a sternal-sparing approach has been adopted whenever possible to minimize surgical trauma and reduce recovery time.</p>
        <p>Preoperative split function testing determines which lung is transplanted first, with the more severely diseased lung being addressed initially. The lungs are carefully separated from the chest cavity, a step that can be complicated by dense adhesions resulting from prior surgeries or pleurodesis. To enhance exposure and control, a traction suture is placed on the dome of the diaphragm and brought out.&#x000a0;The pericardium is then opened to facilitate hilar dissection. Any adhesions are meticulously released using electrocautery to prevent damage to surrounding structures. Subsequently, the dissection of the hilum is carefully performed, preparing the lung for removal and transplantation. This meticulous process demands precise handling to ensure the successful attachment of the donor lung and optimal postoperative function.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The diseased lung is removed, beginning with the division of the inferior pulmonary ligament. Heparin is administered systemically to maintain vessel patency. Subsequently, the pulmonary artery and pulmonary veins are divided using an endostapler, leaving behind an adequate stump for anastomosis. The hilum is prepared by circumferentially opening the pericardium, and the bronchus is centrally prepared. Meanwhile, another team prepares the donor lungs for implantation, keeping them on ice to preserve viability. The donor bronchus, pulmonary artery, and veins are meticulously prepared for transplantation.</p>
        <p>The implantation process begins with the bronchial anastomosis, which is performed using a 3-0 prolene running suture in a telescoping manner to ensure a secure and airtight connection. Subsequently, the pulmonary artery is aligned and anastomosed end-to-end using a 4-0 prolene running suture. Finally, the pulmonary vein anastomosis is meticulously completed, with careful de-airing of the graft before securing the sutures to prevent air embolism. This systematic approach guarantees the proper attachment and function of the transplanted lung, ultimately striving to restore optimal respiratory function in the recipient.</p>
        <p>After graft implantation, ventilation is initiated with a low fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) to minimize the risk of reperfusion injury. Mechanical ventilation settings are adjusted gradually based on the patient's needs and the allograft's function. When indicated, cardiopulmonary bypass is used for hemodynamic support during the operation, providing essential circulatory support and oxygenation until the transplanted lung is fully functional.</p>
        <p>Thorough hemostasis is achieved at the end of the procedure to prevent postoperative bleeding and ensure stability. For a bilateral transplant, the same process is repeated for the other lung, following meticulous steps to ensure successful transplantation and optimal function of both grafts. This careful and systematic approach helps maximize the success of the lung transplant and improve patient outcomes.</p>
        <p>At the end of the lung transplant procedure,&#x000a0;3 chest tubes are inserted to ensure proper drainage&#x02014;1 is placed anteriorly in the chest, another along the diaphragm, and a third posterolaterally toward the apex of the chest. The thoracotomy incision is then closed in layers, including the pectoral fascia, the subcutaneous layer, the subdermal layer, and the skin, to ensure proper wound healing and minimize the risk of infection.</p>
        <p>After the transplant, the double-lumen endotracheal tube is exchanged for a single lumen to facilitate normal ventilation. A bronchoscopy assesses the anastomotic suture line and removes any secretions or clots that may have accumulated. A nasogastric feeding tube is placed to ensure the patient receives adequate nutrition during the initial postoperative period when oral intake may not be possible.</p>
        <p>The surgical duration for a lung transplant typically ranges from 6 to 10 hours. Postoperative management of allograft dysfunction is crucial, and peripheral venovenous ECMO is utilized to support the patient's respiratory function if necessary.&#x000a0;Postoperatively, patients are transferred to the ICU, where they remain on a ventilator until they regain consciousness and their lung function is stable enough to begin weaning. Adequate pain control is provided, and antirejection drugs are initiated immediately to prevent graft rejection. Fluid intake and hemodynamics are meticulously managed in the ICU to optimize end-organ perfusion and ensure the best possible outcomes.</p>
        <p>Most recipients receive a regimen of immunosuppression that typically includes steroids, a cell cycle inhibitor, and a calcineurin inhibitor. Routine postoperative surveillance bronchoscopy is conducted to monitor the condition of the transplanted lungs and detect any potential complications early. Maintenance immunosuppression is continued to prevent rejection and ensure the longevity of the graft.</p>
        <p>Once stable, patients are moved to the cardiothoracic nursing unit based on their recovery progress. The posttransplant rehabilitation begins, including physical therapy and exercises to improve breathing and speech. This rehabilitation phase is crucial for regaining strength and functionality. The expected length of stay for an uncomplicated lung transplant is typically between 1 and 3 weeks.&#x000a0;This comprehensive postoperative care plan ensures that patients receive the support they need for a successful recovery and long-term graft function.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Current Strategies for Immunosuppression Following Lung Transplantation</bold>
</p>
        <p>The current strategy for immunosuppressive therapy after lung transplantation involves a multifaceted approach to prevent rejection and ensure long-term graft survival.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Induction Therapy</bold>
</p>
        <p>Induction therapy is adopted by approximately half of transplant centers globally. This approach aims to reduce and delay acute rejection episodes and potentially lower the incidence of chronic rejection. Despite promising indications of improved outcomes with induction therapy, substantial, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trials remain lacking in confirming its benefits over conventional immunosuppression and effectively comparing different agents.&#x000a0;Consequently, debate persists regarding its overall efficacy.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Maintenance Therapy</bold>
</p>
        <p>Maintenance therapy typically involves a triple-drug regimen, which is the standard practice in lung transplantation. This regimen includes:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Calcineurin inhibitor: Commonly, cyclosporine or tacrolimus.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Antiproliferative agents: Such as mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Corticosteroids: To reduce inflammation and immune response.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>
<bold>Treatment of Acute Rejection</bold>
</p>
        <p>High-dose intravenous steroid pulses are the primary treatment for an acute rejection episode. For cases of persistent or recurrent acute rejection, rapamycin may be added to the therapeutic regimen. If rejection continues despite these measures, secondary options include antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or murine monoclonal antibody (OKT3). Intravenous immune globulin is used in refractory cases, providing an additional layer of immune modulation.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Management of Chronic Rejection</bold>
</p>
        <p>Managing chronic rejection remains&#x000a0;1 of the most challenging aspects of the lung transplantation process. For patients exhibiting signs of chronic rejection while on cyclosporine, switching to tacrolimus may be considered. If this switch fails to halt the progression of chronic rejection, high-dose steroid pulses and ATG are commonly used. Additionally, rapamycin can be introduced as an additional immunosuppressive agent.</p>
        <p>In refractory cases, more aggressive treatments such as total lymphoid irradiation and photopheresis are considered last-resort therapies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24510.r18">[18]</xref> These options aim to modulate the immune system more profoundly when conventional therapies fail to effectively control chronic rejection.&#x000a0;This comprehensive and adaptive approach to immunosuppressive therapy after lung transplantation is crucial for managing acute and chronic rejection, aiming to prolong graft survival and improve patient outcomes.</p>

        <title>Clinical Significance</title>
        <p>Lung transplantation remains the ultimate treatment for patients with end-stage lung disease, offering a life-saving option when other medical or surgical interventions have failed. As the prevalence of chronic lung diseases continues to rise, and with the increasing number of patients experiencing long-term lung damage due to COVID-19, the demand for donor lungs is expected to grow. This escalating need underscores the ongoing challenge of donor organ shortages, which is likely to result in more deaths among patients on the waitlist for lung transplantation.</p>
        <p>EVLP has emerged as a promising modality to address the scarcity of donor lungs. EVLP allows for the assessment and reconditioning of marginal donor lungs before transplantation, potentially increasing the pool of usable organs. This technology is particularly important given the limited availability of ideal lung donors and the risks associated with prolonged ischemic times during traditional preservation methods.</p>
        <p>Despite the increasing frequency of lung transplant procedures, the median survival rate for recipients between 2009 and 2016 remains approximately 6.5 years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24510.r20">[20]</xref> While enhancements in surgical techniques and immediate postoperative management have significantly improved short-term survival rates, long-term outcomes have not seen a corresponding improvement. This stagnation in long-term survival is primarily due to CLAD, which affects over 50% of lung transplant recipients within&#x000a0;5 years post-surgery. CLAD remains a critical challenge because there are currently no effective treatments to prevent or manage this condition, which significantly diminishes the long-term success of lung transplants.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, lung transplantation remains a crucial treatment option for patients with end-stage lung disease and has seen improvements in short-term outcomes, yet significant challenges persist in the field. The shortage of donor lungs, exacerbated by rising demand, and the impact of CLAD on long-term survival highlight the need for continued innovation and research. While advancements such as EVLP offer promise in expanding the donor pool and enhancing transplant success rates, further efforts are required to tackle the underlying issues affecting long-term outcomes.</p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>The success of a lung transplant program hinges on the collaborative efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team dedicated to patient-centered care, optimal outcomes, safety, and teamwork. This team encompasses transplant pulmonologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, anesthesiologists, intensivists, perfusionists, psychologists, social workers, and nurses, each contributing specialized skills and expertise. Preoperative preparation involves the pulmonologist selecting suitable candidates and optimizing their condition, while the cardiothoracic surgeon executes the technically demanding transplant procedure and addresses postoperative complications. The anesthesiologist ensures safe anesthesia management, while the intensivist oversees critical care after surgery. Perfusionists administer ECMO support as necessary, and psychologists and social workers offer crucial mental health support and facilitate social care coordination.</p>
        <p>Effective interprofessional communication and care coordination are vital in this complex lung transplantation process. The transplant nurse orchestrates various aspects of the procedure, including donor workup, patient education, and follow-up. Nursing staff, respiratory therapists, physiotherapists, dieticians, and the patient's family contribute significantly to rehabilitation. Pharmacists and transplant pulmonologists collaborate to prescribe the appropriate immunosuppression regimen. Detailed planning and regular team discussions among the interprofessional healthcare team are paramount to reduce morbidity and enhance outcomes, underscoring the necessity for a dedicated&#x000a0;ICU care&#x000a0;team specialized in the management of lung transplantation. This collaborative approach ensures comprehensive patient care, leading to improved outcomes and the overall success of the lung transplant program.</p>

        <title>Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions</title>
        <p>Programs should evaluate and enhance communication channels among critical care team members, including cardiothoracic surgeons, intensivists, respiratory therapists, pharmacists, registered nurses, and perfusionists. Establishing efficient and clear communication pathways is essential for coordinated care throughout the lung transplant process, from the preoperative to the postoperative phases. Regular interdisciplinary meetings and case reviews facilitate the sharing of critical information and updates regarding patient status and care plans. Implementing standardized communication tools, such as checklists and electronic health records with real-time updates, ensures that all healthcare team members have access to uniform information, minimizing the risk of errors and enhancing patient safety.</p>
        <p>By&#x000a0;prioritizing these communication strategies, healthcare&#x000a0;professionals&#x000a0;can identify areas for improvement and streamline processes to enhance medical care. For instance, implementing a centralized communication platform can facilitate rapid consultations and decision-making, while structured handoff protocols can guarantee continuity of care during transitions between various care phases. Such initiatives can result in more efficient management of lung transplantation in patients, ultimately enhancing outcomes and ensuring that each patient receives comprehensive, coordinated care at every step of their treatment journey.</p>

        <title>Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Monitoring</title>
        <p>Effective communication, decision-making processes, and the ability to recognize individual patient needs among healthcare professionals significantly influence patient outcomes. To enhance these aspects, teams should develop methods to monitor and ensure effective communication. This can include holding regular interdisciplinary meetings, implementing structured handoff protocols, and adopting standardized communication tools such as Situation-Background-Assessment-Recommendation (SBAR).</p>
        <p>Additionally, it is crucial to include nursing and allied health professionals as influential advocates for individual patients. Nurses, respiratory therapists, pharmacists, and physical therapists often maintain the most direct and continuous contact with patients, enabling them to offer crucial insights into patients' conditions and needs. By fostering an environment where the healthcare team members are encouraged to participate actively in discussions and decision-making processes, the team can better tailor care to each patient's unique situation.</p>
        <p>Implementing feedback mechanisms, such as debriefings after critical events or regular surveys to assess communication effectiveness, can help identify areas for improvement. Training programs focused on communication skills and team collaboration can further strengthen these processes. By prioritizing comprehensive, inclusive communication and decision-making, teams can better address individual patient needs, ultimately improving care quality and patient outcomes.</p>
