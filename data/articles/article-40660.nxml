        <p>Domestic violence in Florida is legally defined as "Any assault, aggravated assault, battery, aggravated battery, sexual assault, sexual battery, stalking, aggravated stalking, kidnapping, false imprisonment, or any other criminal offenses resulting in physical injury or death of a family or household member by another family or household member." A Florida State Task Force was established to enhance education and increase public awareness regarding domestic violence. This task force implemented several changes to improve the detection and prevention of domestic violence.&#x000a0;Florida has legislation requiring all physicians, nurses, dentists, dental hygienists, midwives, psychologists, and psychotherapists to obtain 2 hours of domestic violence education every third renewal period. The Domestic Violence Data Resource Center (DVDRC) and Domestic Violence Fatality Review teams examine cases of domestic violence that result in fatalities and identify potential policy changes that might prevent future deaths.</p>
        <p>Domestic and family violence, including intimate partner violence, child abuse, and elder abuse, is a widespread issue in the United States, affecting an estimated 10 million people annually. These forms of violence involve children, adults, and older populations and encompass economic, physical, sexual, emotional, and psychological abuse. This activity outlines evaluation and management strategies for survivors of domestic violence in Florida and the role of healthcare providers in screening and treating individuals who have experienced abuse, with protocols established to identify signs of abuse across various medical settings. This activity also allows interdisciplinary healthcare providers to apply evidence-based guidelines in adherence to state policies and laws for survivors of domestic violence.</p>

        <p content-type="pubmed-excerpt">Family and domestic violence, including&#x000a0;child abuse, intimate partner abuse, and elder abuse, are prevalent problems in the United States, especially in Florida. Family and domestic violence are estimated to affect 10 million people in the United States annually. As a national public health problem, virtually all healthcare professionals will, at some point, evaluate or treat a patient who has experienced some form of domestic or family violence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40660.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40660.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40660.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Unfortunately, most forms of family dysfunction lead to interconnected forms of violence, and the cycle of abuse often continues from childhood in the affected children&#x000a0;through&#x000a0;adult relationships and finally&#x000a0;to the care of older individuals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40660.r4">[4]</xref> Domestic and family&#x000a0;dysfunction include a range of behaviors, including economic, physical, sexual, emotional, and psychological abuse,&#x000a0;affecting children, adults, and older individuals alike.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40660.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40660.r6">[6]</xref></p>
        <p>Intimate partner violence can include stalking, sexual and/or physical violence, and psychological aggression by current or former partners. In the United States, as many as&#x000a0;1 in&#x000a0;4 women and&#x000a0;1 in&#x000a0;9 men are&#x000a0;affected by domestic violence. Domestic violence is thought to be underreported, impacting the affected person and their families, coworkers, and community.&#x000a0;The violence causes&#x000a0;diminished psychological and physical health, decreased quality of life, and reduced productivity. The national economic cost of domestic and family violence is estimated to exceed $12 billion per year. The number of individuals affected is expected to rise over the next 20 years with an increase in the abuse of older adults.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40660.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40660.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40660.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40660.r10">[10]</xref></p>
        <p content-type="pubmed-excerpt">Domestic and family violence is difficult to identify, and many cases go unreported to healthcare professionals and legal authorities. Due to its prevalence in our society, all healthcare professionals, including psychologists, nurses, pharmacists, dentists, physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners, will, at some point, evaluate and treat an affected person or perpetrator of domestic or family violence.</p>

<bold>National Definitions</bold>
</p>
        <p><bold>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:&#x000a0;</bold>Domestic&#x000a0;violence, spousal abuse, battering, and intimate partner violence are terms used to describe the exposure to violence of individuals with whom an abuser has an intimate or romantic relationship. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines domestic violence as "physical violence, sexual violence, stalking, and psychological aggression, including coercive acts, by a current or former intimate partner." Violence occurs in intimate relationships regardless of culture, race, religion, or socioeconomic status. All healthcare professionals must understand that domestic violence, whether emotional, psychological, sexual, or physical, is common in our society, and members of the multidisciplinary team should recognize and make the appropriate referrals.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Florida Definitions</bold>
</p>
        <p><bold>Department of Children and Families:&#x000a0;</bold>Domestic violence is defined by the Florida Department of Children and Families as "a pattern of behaviors that adults or adolescents use against their intimate partners or former partners to establish power and control. This may include physical, sexual, emotional, and economic abuse. In addition, it may also include threats, isolation, pet abuse, using children to manipulate the situation, and a variety of other behaviors used to maintain fear, intimidation, and power over one's partner."</p>
        <p>
<bold>Statutes</bold>
</p>
        <p>Domestic violence under Florida law is defined as "any assault, aggravated assault, battery, aggravated battery, sexual assault, sexual battery, stalking, aggravated stalking, kidnapping, false imprisonment, or any criminal offense resulting in physical injury or death of a family or household member by another family or household member." Family members must "reside in the same single dwelling unit, except for persons who have a child in common."</p>
        <p>
<bold>Abuse Types</bold>
</p>
        <p>Violent abuse&#x000a0;takes many forms, including&#x000a0;stalking and economic, emotional, sexual, physical, or psychological abuse, as well as neglect and Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Domestic and family violence occurs in all races, ages, and sexes&#x000a0;without cultural, socioeconomic, educational, religious, or geographic limitations. This violence can affect individuals of different sexual orientations.</p>
        <p><bold>Stalking:&#x000a0;</bold>Stalking is repeated, unwanted attention that causes fear or concern for safety.&#x000a0;Behaviors&#x000a0;include unwanted letters, emails, texts, or phone calls; watching, following, or spying; repeatedly showing up in the same place; damaging property; and making threats of harm.</p>
        <p><bold>Economic abuse:</bold> Economic or financial abuse occurs when an individual is forced to&#x000a0;depend on an abuser&#x000a0;through improper use of money by a person in a trusting relationship. The abuser may forbid employment or education to gain additional financial control. Examples include coercion to surrender, forgery, theft of possessions, and improper use of guardianship or power of attorney.</p>
        <p><bold>Emotional or psychological abuse:&#x000a0;</bold>Emotional or psychological abuse includes verbal and nonverbal communication that inflicts emotional or mental harm. This type of domestic violence may be subtle but is still harmful to the survivor, often resulting in depression and suicidal thoughts. Emotional or psychological abuse may involve convincing the survivor that the violence is their fault, that no solution exists, and that they are worthless and need the abuser to exist. Many abusers will isolate their targets from friends, family, school, and work.</p>
        <p>Examples of emotional&#x000a0;or psychological abuse include:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Child relationship control: Damaging a relationship with a child deliberately.</p>

          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Exploitation: Using consequences to control choices, for example, "If you call protective services, I could go to jail, and you will have no financial support."</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Expressive: Name-calling, degradation, and threats.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Gaslighting: Presenting false information, making the&#x000a0;survivor doubt their memory and perception, and making the survivor question their sanity.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Reproductive control: Refusing birth control or forced pregnancy terminations.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Threats: Using gestures, words, or weapons to suggest that future harm may occur.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p><bold>Sexual abuse:&#x000a0;</bold>Sexual violence involves using physical coercion to force participation in unwanted sex acts. Perpetrators may incapacitate targets with alcohol or drugs.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Categories of sexual abuse may include:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Forced anal, oral, or vaginal penetration of a&#x000a0;target.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Forced penetration of someone else.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Sexual coercion involving intimidation to pressure consent.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Unwanted exposure to pornography, harassment, sexual violence, filming, taking, or disseminating sexual photographs or videos.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Unwanted sexual contact.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p><bold>Neglect:&#x000a0;</bold>Neglect occurs when an individual responsible for the well-being of a child or an older individual ignores that well-being. Neglect is&#x000a0;the failure to provide for a dependent's emotional, physical, or social needs, including hygiene, nutrition, clothing, shelter, and access to health care. Abandonment is also a form of&#x000a0;neglect.</p>
        <p><bold>Munchausen syndrome by proxy:&#x000a0;</bold>Munchausen syndrome by proxy is a factitious disorder where an individual fabricates or exaggerates mental or physical health problems in the person for whom they care. The primary motive is to gain attention or sympathy. Unlike Munchausen syndrome, the deception involves someone, not themselves, under the person's care.</p>
        <p><bold>Physical abuse:&#x000a0;</bold>The use of physical power that results in injury, disability, or death is a form of physical violence. Other forms of physical violence include coercion, administering drugs or alcohol without permission, and denying medical care.</p>
        <p>Examples of physical abuse include:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">

<bold>The Cycle of Abuse and Violence</bold>
</p>
        <p>Usually, abuse begins with verbal threats that escalate to physical violence. Violent events are often unpredictable, and the triggers for the targets are unclear. Affected individuals live in constant fear of the next violent attack. Violence and abuse are perpetrated in an endless cycle involving&#x000a0;3 phases&#x02014;tension-building, explosive, and honeymoon.</p>
        <p><bold>Tension-building phase:&#x000a0;</bold>In this phase, the abuser becomes more judgmental, temperamental, and upset, causing the target to feel like they are "walking on eggshells." Eventually, the tension escalates until the abuser explodes. During this phase, the target may attempt to calm the situation, stay away, or reason with the abuser to no avail. The abuser exhibits moodiness and unpredictability, resorting to screaming, threats, and intimidation. They may also use children as tools for intimidation and engage in alcohol and drug use.</p>
        <p><bold>Explosive phase:&#x000a0;</bold>During this phase, the target may attempt to protect themselves and their family by contacting authorities. This phase often results in injuries to the affected person. The abuser may begin by breaking items and escalate to striking, choking, and rape. The affected person could be subjected to imprisonment. Emotional, verbal, physical, financial, and sexual abuse are common.</p>

        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>Domestic and family violence, including child, intimate partner, or elder abuse, frequently starts when a partner, parent, or caretaker feels the need to dominate or control. Abuse begins with emotional or verbal threats and may escalate to physical violence.&#x000a0;Affected people live in a constant state of fear. The perpetrator&#x000a0;may be explosively violent. After the violent event, the perpetrator may apologize. This&#x000a0;cycle of violence usually repeats.</p>

<bold>Risk Factors for&#x000a0;Domestic and Family Violence</bold>
</p>
        <p>Risk factors for domestic and family violence include individual, relationship, community, and societal issues. A recognized, inverse relationship exists between education levels and the occurrence of domestic violence&#x02014;lower education levels correlate with higher likelihoods of domestic violence. Childhood abuse is commonly associated with becoming a perpetrator of domestic violence as an adult. Perpetrators of domestic violence commonly repeat acts of violence with new partners. Substance use, such as drugs and alcohol, increases the incidence of domestic violence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40660.r15">[15]</xref></p>
        <p>Children who survive&#x000a0;or witness domestic and family violence may believe that&#x000a0;violence is a reasonable way to resolve a conflict.&#x000a0;Men who learn that&#x000a0;women are not equally respected are more likely to abuse&#x000a0;women in adulthood. Women who witness domestic violence as children are more likely to experience trauma or violence from their spouses later in life. While&#x000a0;women are usually the targets of domestic violence, gender roles can sometimes be reversed.</p>

        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>According to the Florida Department of Children and Families website, in 2020, there were 106,515 reported crimes of domestic violence to Florida law enforcement agencies, leading to 63,217 arrests. During fiscal year 2020 to 2021, Florida's certified domestic violence centers provided 412,360 nights of emergency shelter to 10,287 survivors of domestic violence and their children. Advocates developed 150,799 individualized safety plans, offered a total of 191,451 hours of advocacy and counseling services, and responded to 72,321 domestic violence hotline calls from individuals seeking emergency assistance. Many survivors of domestic violence do not report their abusers to the police or access services due to reasons such as shame, fear, or being prevented from doing so by their abusers. Therefore, statistical figures may not accurately reflect the actual incidence of abuse.</p>
        <p>Domestic violence is a serious and challenging public health problem&#x02014;approximately 1 in&#x000a0;3 women and&#x000a0;1 in&#x000a0;10 men aged 18 or older experience domestic violence. Annually, domestic violence is responsible for over 1500 deaths in the United States and up to 200 deaths in Florida alone. In Florida, more than 1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men endure physical violence, stalking, or rape. Domestic violence survivors often sustain severe physical injuries requiring medical treatment at hospitals or clinics. The cost to individuals and society is significant. The national annual expenditure on medical and mental health services related to acute domestic violence exceeds $8 billion, with even higher costs for long-term or chronic conditions.</p>
        <p>Financial hardship and unemployment contribute significantly to domestic violence, with economic downturns correlating with increased calls to the National Domestic Violence Hotline. Fortunately, the national rate of nonfatal domestic violence is decreasing, attributed to factors such as declining marriage rates, reduced domesticity, improved access to domestic violence shelters, better economic conditions, and an aging population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40660.r17">[17]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40660.r13">[13]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40660.r20">[20]</xref></p>

<bold>Epidemiology of Child Abuse&#x000a0;</bold>
</p>
        <p>Age, family income, and ethnicity are all risk factors for both sexual and physical abuse. Gender is a risk factor for sexual abuse but not for physical abuse. Each year, over 3,000,000 referrals to child protective authorities are made. Despite healthcare professionals often being the first to examine survivors, only about 10% of the referrals come from medical personnel. The fatality rate is approximately 2 deaths per 100,000 children, with women accounting for over half of the perpetrators.</p>
        <p><bold>Race:&#x000a0;</bold>Maltreatment of children is found in every race, culture, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.</p>
        <p><bold>Gender:&#x000a0;</bold>Both men and women are affected equally by domestic violence, but homicide rates are slightly higher among men.</p>
        <p><bold>Morbidity and mortality:&#x000a0;</bold>Children exposed to abuse may endure pain, humiliation, fear, and loss of self-esteem, leading to various injuries. Physical injury may range from minor trauma to severe conditions such as disfigurement, brain trauma, and even death. Long-term consequences include heightened anxiety, depression, substance use disorders, self-mutilation, suicidal tendencies, criminal behavior, and increased risks of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, premature mortality, obesity, and chronic mental health issues. Mortality rates increase with repeated episodes of trauma. Homicide is a leading cause of death in children aged 1 to&#x000a0;4, with over 80% of fatalities from child abuse occurring in children aged 4 or younger.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Epidemiology of Intimate Partner Violence&#x000a0;</bold>
</p>
        <p>According to the CDC, 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men will experience physical violence by their intimate partner at some point during their lifetimes. About 1 in 3 women and nearly 1 in 6 men will experience some form of sexual violence in their lifetimes. Each year, intimate partner violence, sexual violence, and stalking affect over 10,000,000 people. Additionally, 1 in 6 women and 1 in 19 men have experienced stalking, with the majority being stalked by someone they know. An intimate partner is responsible for stalking about 6 in 10 female and 4 in 10 male targets.</p>
        <p>At least&#x000a0;5,000,000 acts of domestic violence against women aged 18 and older occur annually; over&#x000a0;3,000,000&#x000a0;of these acts involve men. While most events are minor (including grabbing, shoving, pushing, slapping, and hitting), serious and sometimes fatal injuries do&#x000a0;occur. Approximately 1.5 million intimate partner rapes and physical assaults are perpetrated against women annually, and approximately 800,000 assaults occur against men. About 1 in 5 women have experienced completed or attempted rape at some point in their lives, compared to about 1% to 2% of men. The incidence of intimate partner violence has declined by over 60%, from about 10 instances of exposure to violence per 1000 persons aged 12 or older to approximately 4 per 1000.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40660.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40660.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40660.r24">[24]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Race:&#x000a0;</bold>African American, American Indian, Alaskan Native women and men, and Hispanic women report higher rates of domestic violence. Asian and Pacific Islander women and men report lower rates of intimate partner violence. However, group differences diminish when sociodemographic and relationship variables are controlled. The spousal homicide rate among African Americans is significantly higher than for white people. Additionally, the incidence of homicide between partners is higher in interracial marriages compared with intraracial marriages.</p>
        <p><bold>Gender:&#x000a0;</bold>Women are more likely to be attacked, injured, or raped by their partners than by any other person. According to the United States Department of Justice, women are 6 times more likely than men to experience violence committed by a spouse or ex-spouse, boyfriend or girlfriend, or ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend. Approximately one-third of all violence against women committed by a single offender is perpetrated by an intimate partner.</p>
        <p>Lesbians report higher levels of sexual violence, ranging from 30% to 40%. Homosexual men may also experience higher levels of sexual violence. Approximately 10% of women who live with intimate female partners report rape, physical assault, or stalking by their cohabitant. One-third of women living with a male partner report exposure to violence by their male cohabitant. Approximately 15% of men living with a male intimate partner report rape, physical assault, or stalking by their cohabitant. In comparison, less than 10% of men who have lived with a female partner experience similar problems. More than half of all homeless women and families report that they are fleeing domestic violence.</p>
        <p><bold>Age:&#x000a0;</bold>Women aged 16 to 24 are more likely to be&#x000a0;survivors of violence at the hands of an intimate partner. Approximately 20% to 30% of women who attend college report violence during a date. Rates of spousal homicide peak in women aged 15 to 24 and decline with age in African Americans but not in whites. As the age difference between&#x000a0;men and&#x000a0;women&#x000a0;increases, so does the risk of spousal homicide.</p>
        <p><bold>Mortality and morbidity:&#x000a0;</bold>Approximately&#x000a0;2,000,000 million injuries and deaths occur each year as a result of domestic violence. About one-third of patients experiencing domestic violence seek care in an emergency department. Each year, approximately 400,000 people report soft tissue trauma. Around 50,000 people report injuries related to intimate partner sexual assault, and 40,000 people report more severe injuries&#x000a0;such as gunshot and stab wounds, fractures, internal injuries, and loss of consciousness.</p>

<bold>Epidemiology of Elder Abuse&#x000a0;</bold>
</p>
        <p>Elder abuse and neglect pose challenges to obtaining accurate incidence data due to under-reporting and sampling difficulties. Notably, it is estimated that abuse occurs in 3% to 10% of the population aged 65 and older. Many older adults may not report abuse due to fear, guilt, ignorance, or shame. Clinicians often underreport elder abuse due to several factors&#x02014;poor recognition of the problem, unfamiliarity with reporting protocols, and concerns regarding patient confidentiality. Older adults may face challenges such as being unable to participate in surveys, language barriers, and having multiple preexisting health conditions. These factors contribute to inaccurate reporting on the prevalence of elder abuse. Despite the difficulties in obtaining exact frequency data, clinicians often encounter elder abuse survivors in clinical practice.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p><bold>Race:&#x000a0;</bold>Elder abuse affects individuals across all racial, socioeconomic, and religious backgrounds. On average, the estimated racial and ethnic distribution of older persons who experience abuse is as follows:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>White: 60%</p>

            <p>Other: 5%</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p><bold>Gender:&#x000a0;</bold>Women are more commonly survivors of abuse among intimate partners and the older population. They report abuse at higher rates, likely due to the severity of injuries often being greater compared to men. However, some studies have found little or no differences based on gender in reporting rates and severity of abuse.</p>
        <p><bold>Age:&#x000a0;</bold>The universally accepted definition of when old age begins is unclear, leading to variability in statistics on elder abuse. Typically, individuals aged 60 or 65 and older are considered older adults.</p>
        <p><bold>Mortality and morbidity:&#x000a0;</bold>Among the older population, survivors of physical abuse and neglect have a significantly higher mortality rate compared to those who have not experienced abuse. Early detection of elder abuse cases leads to reduced morbidity and mortality. Clinician involvement is crucial, as only about 1 in 6 survivors self-report mistreatment to the appropriate authorities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40660.r25">[25]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40660.r26">[26]</xref></p>

<bold>Florida State Law</bold>
</p>
        <p>According to Florida State law, witnessing domestic violence is defined as "violence in the presence of a child if an offender is convicted of a primary offense of domestic violence, and that offense was committed in the presence of a child aged 16 or younger who is a family or household member with the survivor or perpetrator."&#x000a0;In Florida, approximately&#x000a0;7% of domestic homicide&#x000a0;survivors&#x000a0;were children killed by a parent.</p>
        <p>Healthcare professionals who treat children and adolescents should understand the signs and symptoms of domestic violence and intervene quickly to protect young children and adolescents from further abuse.</p>

        <p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends all women be assessed for signs and symptoms of domestic violence during regular and prenatal visits.&#x000a0;Clinicians should offer support and referral information.</p>

        <p>The danger of domestic violence is particularly&#x000a0;acute as both mother and fetus are at risk. Healthcare professionals should be aware of the psychological consequences of domestic abuse during pregnancy.

        <p>Domestic violence occurs in&#x000a0;homosexual,&#x000a0;bisexual, and transgender couples at rates that are thought to be similar to heterosexual women, approximately 25%.</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">

        </list>
        <p>Gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender&#x000a0;survivors may be reticent to report domestic violence. Part of the challenge may be that support services such as shelters, support groups, and hotlines are not regularly available. This results in isolated and unsupported survivors.

<bold>Findings in&#x000a0;Older Populations</bold>

        <p>Older adults are often mistreated by their spouses, children, or relatives.</p>

          <list-item>
            <p>Annually, approximately&#x000a0;2% of older adults experience physical abuse,&#x000a0;1%&#x000a0;experience sexual abuse,&#x000a0;5%&#x000a0;experience neglect,&#x000a0;5% suffer from financial abuse, and&#x000a0;5% suffer from emotional abuse.</p>

          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>Domestic violence in older individuals may be financial or physical. Older adults are often hesitant to report this abuse if they are incurring abuse from the only available caregiver. Targets of abuse are often dependent, infirm, isolated, or mentally impaired. Healthcare professionals should be aware of the high incidence of abuse in this population. Because elder abuse is common, healthcare professionals must remain aware of the potential for abuse. When abuse occurs between&#x000a0;older partners,&#x000a0;the pattern of&#x000a0;partner violence or abuse is long-standing. In the latter case, abuse may be precipitated by issues related to dementia, disability, and changing family relationships. Some states have a high percentage of older residents and a higher percentage of&#x000a0;older&#x000a0;survivors of domestic violence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40660.r25">[25]</xref></p>

<bold>Common Findings in Child Abuse&#x000a0;</bold>
</p>
        <p>The most common injuries are fractures, contusions, bruises, and internal bleeding. Unexpected injuries to pre-walking infants should be investigated. The caregiver should explain unusual injuries to the ears, neck, or torso; otherwise, these injuries should be&#x000a0;investigated. Children who are abused may be unkempt or malnourished. Some display inappropriate behavior, such as aggression, while others are shy, withdrawn, and have poor communication skills. Some children may also be disruptive or hyperactive. School attendance is usually inadequate.</p>

        <p>
<bold>Same-Sex Abuse</bold>
</p>
        <p>Same-sex partner abuse is common and may be challenging to identify. Over 35% of heterosexual women, 40% of homosexual women, and 60% of bisexual women experience domestic violence. For men, the incidence is slightly lower. In addition to common findings of abuse, perpetrators may try to control their partners by threatening to disclose their sexual preferences publicly. Clinicians should be aware that fewer resources are available to help survivors, and the perpetrator and survivor may share the same friends or support groups.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Abuse in Men</bold>
</p>
        <p>Men represent as much as 15% of all cases of domestic violence. Male&#x000a0;survivors are also less likely to seek medical care,&#x000a0;and their incidence may be underreported. These&#x000a0;survivors may have a history of child abuse.</p>

        <p>When evaluating a patient for elder abuse, it is important to ask simple questions. When evaluating the patient for elder abuse, it is recommended to interview the patient and caregiver separately to detect any disparities. Documentation must be accurate and objective, considering that it may be utilized in criminal trials or guardianship hearings, and it should be thorough, complete, legible, and quote direct patient statements where possible. During the examination, it is important to disrobe the patient to assess for injuries, specifically for back injuries, contusions, bruises, and decubitus ulcers.</p>

        <p>Documenting the size, shape, and location of injuries during the physical examination is important. Taking pictures or drawing sketches can aid in accurate documentation. Clinicians should be aware that elder abuse by caregivers is a common problem&#x000a0;that&#x000a0;can occur in both home and institutional settings. Factors that increase the risk of elder abuse by caregivers include poor training, stress, burnout, heavy workload, low pay, job satisfaction, and staffing shortages.</p>

        <p>Domestic violence can be challenging for patients to divulge, particularly when fear is a factor, such as when they present at an emergency department or clinician's office. The key is to establish an assessment protocol and maintain awareness that domestic and family violence may be the cause of the patient's signs and symptoms. Screening should be routinely conducted in primary care, obstetric and gynecologic, psychiatric, pediatric, urgent care, and emergency department settings.</p>
        <p>Establishing that injuries are related to domestic abuse poses a significant challenge. Priority is given to addressing life and limb-threatening injuries. Once stabilization and physical evaluation are completed, healthcare professionals may consider performing laboratory tests and imaging studies, such as x-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as indicated. The initial focus remains on addressing the immediate medical needs that led the patient to seek care in the emergency department.</p>

        <p>Testing for suspected abuse in children involves performing a detailed history and a meticulous physical examination. In cases where head trauma is suspected, clinicians may consider involving an ophthalmologist for an indirect ophthalmoscopy. Laboratory studies are&#x000a0;crucial in forensic evaluation and potential criminal prosecution. In addition, healthcare professionals need to be aware that certain medical conditions may mimic findings resembling child abuse.</p>
        <p><bold>Urine testing:&#x000a0;</bold>Urinalysis or a urine test for suspected child abuse includes screening for sexually transmitted diseases and considering bladder or kidney trauma if blood is present.</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">

Screening all siblings aged 2 or younger should also be considered by the clinician.</p>
        <p>The skeletal survey should include&#x000a0;2 views of each extremity (anteroposterior and lateral), as well as views of the skull (lateral), chest (lateral), spine, abdomen, pelvis, hands, and feet.

Clinicians should have a low threshold to obtain a CT scan of the head when abuse is suspected, especially in an infant younger than 12 months. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast is indicated for unconscious children who have traumatic abdominal findings such as abrasions, bruises, tenderness, absent or decreased bowel sounds, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting, or elevated AST, an ALT greater than 80 IU/L, or lipase more than 100 IU/L.</p>

        <title>Prognosis</title>
        <p>Without social services, mental health intervention, and treatment, all forms of abuse (domestic and family violence) can often recur and escalate in both frequency and severity, leading to a poor prognosis for recovery. Statistics show that:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Approximately 75% of survivors continue to experience abuse.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>More than half of abused women who attempt suicide will make subsequent attempts, often resulting in success.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>In children, the potential for poor outcomes is particularly high due to the lifelong effects of abuse. In addition to managing physical injuries, the mental consequences can be catastrophic. Research indicates a significant association between child sexual abuse and increased risk of psychiatric disorders in adulthood. Moreover, there is a considerable risk that the cycle of violence will perpetuate following childhood exposure.</p>
        <p>Children raised in families where sexual abuse occurs may develop a range of psychological conditions, including:</p>

<bold>Screening for Child Abuse</bold>
</p>
        <p>Child abuse and neglect can result in acute trauma, anxiety, depression, unwanted pregnancy, substance use disorder, suicide, and risky behaviors. Children are more likely to be involved in family and intimate partner abuse. The most common risk factors for child abuse and neglect include poverty, low education, large family size, single-parent households, young parents, step-parents in the home, and psychiatric disease. Clinicians must take responsibility for identifying child abuse to prevent recurrent injuries.</p>
        <p>While routine child abuse screening is not yet established, it is necessary. Multiple missed appointments and delays in seeking medical treatment may indicate abuse or neglect. Many organizations offer free screening tools; however, most lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity. False positive and false negative results can have serious consequences, including both under- and overreporting of abuse.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Screening for Intimate Partner Violence</bold>
</p>
        <p>Some experts believe screening should only occur when signs and symptoms are present. Routine screening may be problematic due to the stigma, which can result in patient anxiety. Additionally, patients who have experienced abuse may be unwilling to use available resources to end the abuse. Nonetheless, several national organizations, such as the American Medical Association and Family Violence Prevention Fund, recommend screening all women for intimate partner violence. Screening tools for abuse are available to assist with assessment, intervention, documentation, and referral.</p>
        <p>Studies have shown that abused women who receive counseling experience fewer instances of intimate partner violence during and after pregnancy. Screening has the potential to decrease abuse and improve health outcomes. Although targets of abuse may not always be willing to use the information provided, ignoring abuse can lead to severe consequences. Clinicians can play a crucial role by providing the necessary resources to educate and inform patients.</p>
        <p>The CDC provides numerous tools to assist&#x000a0;clinicians in the free publication&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Intimate Partner Violence and Sexual Violence Victimization Assessment Instruments for Use in Healthcare Settings</italic>. These tools include:</p>

<bold>Screening for Elder Abuse</bold>
</p>
        <p>Older patients are at risk of abuse in both home environments and institutional settings. Risk factors for elder abuse include increased age, dementia, abnormal behaviors, cognitive decline, physical dependency, and impairment in daily living activities. In institutional settings, a shortage of qualified staff is a significant constraint. Screening for elder abuse should include a review of social and financial information. The Abuse Suspicion Index is a useful screening tool for cognitively intact patients. For patients with dementia, clinicians must rely on the physical exam.&#x000a0;Bruising can indicate physical abuse, but older individuals commonly take blood-thinning agents that result in easy bruising. Survivors of physical abuse tend to have bruises with specific characteristics, such as bruises of varying age,&#x000a0;larger than&#x000a0;5 cm, located on the face, lateral right arm, or posterior torso. In many instances, the&#x000a0;survivor may recall how the bruise occurred.</p>
        <p>If abuse is suspected, radiographs of ribs, small bones, and the face should be considered. A CT head scan should also be considered to rule out subdural hemorrhage. A pelvic examination should be conducted if any signs of sexual abuse are apparent. Weight loss may indicate physical or medical neglect due to malnutrition, but other common causes of weight loss should be ruled out. Pressure ulcers should raise suspicion of neglect. All clinicians should&#x000a0;be aware of the potential signs and symptoms of elder abuse and be familiar with screening tools. When abuse is suspected, the history and physical examination should be carefully conducted and documented with additional laboratory and imaging tests as needed.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Challenges in Screening&#x000a0;</bold>
</p>
        <p>While screening is crucial to identify domestic and family, several barriers exist, and&#x000a0;many clinicians do not take the time to screen patients. Unfortunately,&#x000a0;no&#x000a0;universal approach has been established to assess domestic violence. In addition, many clinicians do not have the time, resources, or desire&#x000a0;to get involved. Many healthcare professionals remain ignorant&#x000a0;of the warning signs and risk factors. In most states, reporting of suspected elder abuse or neglect is required by statute. However, few healthcare professionals are prosecuted for failure to comply, hindering reporting. Routine screening increases the odds of cases being identified.</p>
        <p>Challenges in screening include:</p>

        <p>Florida Statute 415.502 requires anyone "who knows, or has reasonable cause to suspect, that a child is an abused or neglected child, shall report such knowledge or suspicion."

        <p>In Florida, the reporting requirement is not limited to first-person reporting. Healthcare professionals cannot assume that someone else has made a report. They must always make a report if they suspect a child is or has been abused.</p>
