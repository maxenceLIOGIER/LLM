        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Vanishing twin syndrome, as the name depicts, is a condition in which one of a set of twins or multiple embryos dies in utero, disappear, or gets resorbed partially or entirely, with an outcome of a spontaneous reduction of a multi-fetus pregnancy to a singleton pregnancy, portraying the image of a vanishing twin. In simple words, the number of embryos conceived, as observed via ultrasonographic examination in early pregnancy, differs from the number of fetuses delivered. This phenomenon occurs in multi-fetus pregnancies, commonly during the first trimester.</p>
        <p>Twin loss can happen in the form of miscarriage, of which the mother is aware or in the form of vaginal bleeding or spotting in the first trimester without any knowledge of the mother, as vaginal bleeding is instead a frequent obstetric complication during the first trimester of pregnancy so that the twin loss may go unnoticed. This phenomenon can range from the disappearance of an early empty gestational sac to a sac that had developed a fetal pole to a fetus with documented heart activity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r1">[1]</xref></p>

        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>Before the advent of ultrasound, little was known about the phenomenon of vanishing twin syndrome (VTS). It was disclosed in 1945 by Stoeckel that the rate of multiple gestations is greater than the rate of their birth, i.e., a twin or even multiple can be lost during multi-fetus pregnancy before the mother is even aware of the loss or the fact that she was carrying multiple fetuses. Since ultrasonography and transvaginal sonography in early pregnancy, vanishing twin syndrome is more frequently diagnosed. Vanishing twin syndrome is evaluated to happen in 36% of twin pregnancies and in half of the pregnancies that begins with at least three or more gestational sacs.</p>
        <p>With respect to assisted reproductive techniques (ART), it is assessed to occur in 20-30% pregnancies. This phenomenon is progressively predominant with the utilization of the assisted conceptive methods, as more than one embryo is transferred to the uterus; the rate of multiple gestations also increases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;The vanishing twine syndrome was seen to be associated with very low birth weight (VLBV) and low APGAR scores.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r8">[8]</xref></p>

        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>Abnormalities that brings about the vanishing of the fetus are usually present from right off the early development as opposed to happening from an intense acute insult.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;A study including 30 patients performed by Robinson and Caines demonstrated the fetal surface of the placenta as an empty and flattened sac, as pathological evidence of the disappearing twin. Another study conducted by Finberg and Birnholz found a small area containing 30 ml of dark brown blood in the pathological specimen of abortion; this observation was followed by the appearance of a hemorrhagic second sac seen on ultrasonography, which made the patient opt for elective abortion. As per Finberg and Birnholz, if the pregnancy ends in abortion, the results are that the product of conception is commonly fragmented. On the contrary, if the pregnancy continues to term, the subsequent sac may have been removed or expelled, resorbed or fragmented, or may persevere as a little atretic section neglected considerably even after careful examination of the placenta and the membranes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>The vanishing twin may have the following physiologic outcomes:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Resorption: Even though resorption is the most likely physiologic explanation for the vanishing of the specific proportion of the gestational sac, the valid incidence of resorption is still unknown. Different study results show that resorption can be observed from as early as the seventh week to as late as the twelfth week of gestations. It is evident in any case that resorption of gestational sacs during pregnancy happens without affecting the co-twin. Regardless of the resorption of the vanishing twin, there are excellent chances of the survival of the other twin, as resorption mostly occurs in the first trimester.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r9">[9]</xref></p>

            <p>Blighted Ovum: By definition, a blighted ovum is the gestational sacs inside which no embryo can be visualized via ultrasonography. According to some studies, most of the pregnancies that ended up with the vanishing of a fetus were subsequently found to be anembryonic pregnancy co-existing with normal pregnancy. The result could be in the form of vaginal bleeding in the first trimester, indicating the expulsion of the anembryonic sac. It is advisable, therefore, to undergo a thorough ultrasonographic examination before opting for dilation and curettage, as the process of dilation and curettage may end up in the accidental abortion of the other surviving twin.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r9">[9]</xref></p>

            <p>Fetus papyraceous: Fetus papyraceous is a mummified, compressed or flattened fetus associated with the other viable fetus. This is very rare and most commonly occurs in multiple gestations. The deceased fetus gets flattened in between the membranes of the other viable fetus and the uterine wall. The demise of the fetus usually occurs right off in the early second trimester. The early demise of the twin may result in complete resorption, but as the pregnancy continues to term, the twin may become macerated and may affect the other viable twin as well, as the pregnancy continues. This course of events can be well observed via regular ultrasonographic examinations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;Additionally, a vanishing twin has also been linked with several of the fetal malformations in the surviving twin via an unknown mechanism.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r6">[6]</xref></p>

        <p>It is essential to examine the placenta after delivering the viable co-twin, to know about the morphologic characteristics of the lost twin. Although a vanished twin pregnancy can be noted via an ultrasound, no such histologic confirmatory evidence has been presented previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r11">[11]</xref> The results of studies after examination of the placenta ranged from histologically regular anembryonic gestational sacs to identifiable residues of fetal tissue.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r12">[12]</xref> In some cases, a mummified, compressed fetus in association with a viable fetus was observed, a condition called fetus papyraceous.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>In a study, the histopathologic examination of the placenta revealed a gestational sac that was containing amorphous material, surrounded by degenerated chorionic villi up against a normal amniochorionic membrane.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;One study based on the pathological findings in placentas from pregnancies complicated by the vanishing twin syndrome confirmed via ultrasonographic evidence revealed well-delineated plaques of fibrin deposits and embryonic tissue remnants, hinting towards the disappearance of a conceptus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r13">[13]</xref></p>

        <p>The most likely clinical presentation of a vanishing twin pregnancy is vaginal bleeding or spotting, uterine cramps, or pelvic pain, which indicates the loss of the conceptus. This can occur during the first trimester of pregnancy and may go unnoticed by the mother as missed abortion or vanishing through later gestational ages. Studies have told that most of the patients are usually more than 30 years old.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>Patients who conceived via assisted reproductive technique (ART) are especially worried about the outcomes of vanishing twin pregnancy on the viable co-twin and are brought into medical attention earlier, as multiple embryos are transferred into the uterus and chances of twin gestation and vanishing twin phenomenon to occur are higher.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r4">[4]</xref> The history will usually indicate a previously documented fetal heart activity or more than one gestational sac to spontaneous reduction into singleton pregnancy as per subsequent ultrasonographic findings through later gestational ages or at the time of delivery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r14">[14]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r4">[4]</xref></p>

        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>Examination via ultrasound during pregnancy confirms the presence of the vanishing twin phenomenon. Additionally, the examination of the placenta after giving birth provides morphological details about the vanishing twin that was established following an ultrasonographic examination.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r15">[15]</xref></p>
        <p>Moreover, a study performed to compare the rise of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) between normally progressing twin pregnancies and pregnancies with vanishing twins demonstrated a slower rise of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) in vanishing twin pregnancies as compared to the normal twin pregnancies. The reason for the slower rate of human chorionic gonadotrophin rise could be the result of poor trophoblastic activity due to embryonic causes. These findings indicate that the abnormality in the human chorionic gonadotrophin in vanishing twin syndrome is present from the earliest days of implantation and not due to some acute insult.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r16">[16]</xref></p>
        <p>A recent study, including a large series of pregnancies with a vanishing twin, was performed to determine the use of maternal serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) and serum-free B-human chorionic gonadotrophin (B-HCG) in first-trimester screening for trisomies in relation to the interval between embryonic death and blood sampling. Compared to the previous studies, this study revealed that multiples of the median (MoM) values of maternal serum free B-human chorionic gonadotrophin (B-HCG) were not altered, but that of PAPP-A (MoM) was increased in both pregnancies with an empty gestational sac or a dead embryo.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r17">[17]</xref></p>
        <p>If the pregnancy is conceived via an assisted reproductive technique, complicated by advanced maternal age, chances of vanishing twin phenomenon to occur get higher, most probably due to the increased chances of chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus associated with advanced maternal age.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r18">[18]</xref>&#x000a0;The regular prenatal&#x000a0;examination&#x000a0;is highly advisable in such cases, which includes: ultrasonographic examinations and first and second-trimester maternal serum markers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r19">[19]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r20">[20]</xref></p>

        <p>There is no special medical care necessary for an uncomplicated vanishing twin pregnancy when the twin is lost during the first trimester of pregnancy. The mother may experience vaginal bleeding or spotting or pelvic pain, which needs regular medical care. The other fetus has higher chances of survival and could be delivered normally.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>On the other hand, if the disappearance of a twin complicates the pregnancy during the second or third trimester, then the pregnancy could be treated as high-risk pregnancy, as the outcomes of such pregnancies through later gestational ages might affect the other twin adversely. Regular prenatal visits to assess any signs of complications and keep a check on both maternal and fetal health is necessary to avoid adverse outcomes and their effect on both maternal and fetal health.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r4">[4]</xref></p>

        <p>It is advisable to have regular prenatal follow up and have the pregnancy assessed with the help of ultrasonographic examinations, to have knowledge about the fetal anomalies associated with the demise of the twin.

If the surviving co-twin is at risk, the obstetrician/gynecologist may recommend aborting the ailing fetus, which could be agonizing for the parents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;In such a situation, the provider may ask the bioethical staff of the hospital to help make the decision easier for some parents who have strong religious beliefs against abortion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r25">[25]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>An interprofessional approach to health care of the patient must be taken to prevent errors and improve health care outcomes through communication, staying up-to-date on the patient&#x02019;s current health status, recent physical and diagnostic evaluation of the patient, and mental well-being.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30968.r26">[26]</xref></p>
