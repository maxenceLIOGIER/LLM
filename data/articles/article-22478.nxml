        <title>Indications</title>
        <p>In the United States, the first <italic toggle="yes">Haemophilus influenzae</italic> type b (Hib) vaccine received approval in 1985 as a pure polysaccharide CPS vaccine, demonstrating ineffectiveness due to the young age at which this vaccine must be administered and was soon replaced by conjugated forms of the vaccine. The conjugated vaccines conferred longer and more robust protection against invasive Haemophilus type b infections, leading to exclusive use of the conjugated form of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines in the USA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22478.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;In the 1980s, just before developing the Hib conjugate vaccine, Hib was the most common cause of meningitis in children less than&#x000a0;5 years old. By the early 1990s, the use of the Hib conjugate vaccine caused a 99% drop in infections caused by Hib.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22478.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Widespread use of the Hib vaccine has also been shown to significantly decrease rates of epiglottitis, which usually occurs in children.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22478.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Recommendations are that all infants receive the Hib vaccine. The FDA recommends&#x000a0;1 of&#x000a0;2 vaccine schedules for parents to choose from; both involve the first dose of the vaccine at&#x000a0;2 months of age. The earliest first dose can be as early as&#x000a0;6 weeks of age. The schedules vary based on the brand of the vaccine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22478.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;The schedules are discussed further in this topic's &#x0201c;Administration&#x0201d; section. Indications for the H. influenzae vaccine include children with mild illness (eg, afebrile or low-grade fever) at the time of immunization visit. If the child has a fever, the physician should use clinical judgment, based on the severity of the fever and other symptoms, to determine if the child should receive the Hib vaccine at that visit. Ideally, immunizations should be given on time to prevent deviation from the vaccine schedule and the risk of missed doses over long periods.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22478.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>Other at-risk populations recommended to receive at least&#x000a0;1 booster of the Hib vaccine, depending on age and previous Hib vaccination status, include:&#x000a0;</p>

        <p>Research has shown that preterm and low-weight infants benefit from the same Hib vaccination schedule as at-term and average-weight infants when using the hexavalent vaccine specifically.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22478.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Maternal immunization during the third trimester is not currently an FDA recommendation but has been studied in the&#x000a0;USA and has been shown to increase serum and cord blood antibody titers. Vaccination at this time was shown to be safe and did not harm the infants&#x02019; immune response to the vaccine, compared to infants whose mothers did not receive the vaccine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22478.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;Though this demonstrates the safety and potential benefit of vaccination during the third trimester of pregnancy, the FDA has no current recommendation for or against vaccination with Hib during pregnancy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22478.r2">[2]</xref></p>

        <title>Mechanism of Action</title>
        <p>The composition of the polysaccharide capsule of Hib is polyribosyl ribitol phosphate (PRP), which, like other polysaccharide capsules, acts as an antigen that does not recruit T-cells. Therefore, the polysaccharide form of the vaccine is not immunogenic before the age of 2 because only small numbers of antibodies form via the T-cell-independent immune process. The conjugate form of the vaccine is made by covalently attaching the PRP capsule to a protein, which recruits T-cells and leads to the formation of sufficient numbers of anti-PRP antibodies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22478.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;The Hib vaccines available in the U.S. as of 2019 use either tetanus toxoid conjugate or meningococcal protein conjugate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22478.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Research has shown that the use of the Hib vaccine in combination with the acellular pertussis vaccine, as is the case in diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis adsorbed inactivated poliovirus, and <italic toggle="yes">Haemophilus</italic> b conjugate (tetanus toxoid conjugate)&#x000a0;vaccine&#x000a0;(DTaP-IPV/Hib)&#x000a0;has been shown to decrease the immunogenicity and possibly contribute to the Hib vaccine failures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22478.r1">[1]</xref> Importantly, administration of the Hib vaccine and DTap (which contains acellular pertussis) at the same appointment but in different injection sites has shown no evidence of decreased Hib immunogenicity or increased Hib vaccine failures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22478.r7">[7]</xref></p>

        <p>For routine vaccination,&#x000a0;2 schedules are recommended by the FDA, neither of which is more efficacious. If using monovalent, monovalent tetanus toxoid conjugate, or polyvalent DTap, inactivated poliovirus, and Hib conjugate - vaccinate at 2, 4, and 6 months and then a booster between 12&#x000a0;to 15 months. If using monovalent meningococcal protein conjugate - vaccinate at 2 and 4 months with a booster between 12&#x000a0;to 15 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22478.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22478.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The catch-up schedule for the Hib vaccine depends on the child's age when initiating catch-up and how many doses, if any, they received in the past.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22478.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Healthy children at least&#x000a0;5 years old who have received no previous Hib vaccinations or an incomplete Hib schedule do not require further Hib vaccination.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22478.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0; &#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Children between the ages of 1&#x000a0;and 5 years old who are receiving chemotherapy or radiation, have anatomic or functional asplenia, have an HIV infection, or are immunoglobulin/complement deficient are also recommended to be revaccinated with the Hib vaccine. If they received&#x000a0;1 or fewer doses of the Hib vaccine by&#x000a0;1 year of age, they should receive&#x000a0;2 more doses&#x000a0;8 weeks apart. If they received at least&#x000a0;2 doses of the Hib vaccine by&#x000a0;1 year of age, they should receive&#x000a0;1 additional dose at least&#x000a0;8 weeks after the most recent dose. Any dose given less than 14 days after the initiation of chemotherapy or radiation should be readministered greater than&#x000a0;3 months after chemotherapy is finished. Those with an elective splenectomy and at least 15 months old with no previous Hib vaccinations should&#x000a0;receive&#x000a0;1 dose at least&#x000a0;2 weeks before the procedure. If an individual between 5&#x000a0;and 18 years old&#x000a0;with HIV has never received the Hib vaccine, they should receive&#x000a0;1 dose. All individuals receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplants should receive&#x000a0;3 doses of the Hib vaccine within&#x000a0;6 to&#x000a0;12 months after a successful transplant; each dose should be&#x000a0;4 weeks apart.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22478.r2">[2]</xref></p>

        <title>Adverse Effects</title>
        <p>Between 1990&#x000a0;and 2013, 29747 cases of adverse effects following the administration of the Hib vaccine were reported to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). No attempt was made to describe the causality of adverse effects from these reports. Adverse effects are classified as either serious or non-serious. Serious&#x000a0;adverse effects are defined as those that result in death, life-threatening illness, require an extended hospital stay, or permanent disability&#x02014;17% of the&#x000a0;adverse effects are classified as being serious. In descending order of frequency, the&#x000a0;10 most common, serious&#x000a0;adverse effects were fever, vomiting, convulsions, irritability, intussusception, diarrhea, crying, hypotonia, lethargy, and apnea. In descending order of frequency, the&#x000a0;10 most common, non-serious&#x000a0;adverse effects were fever, erythema at the injection site, crying, rash, irritability, screaming, hives, swelling of the injection site, agitation, and erythema.</p>
        <p>One day after vaccine administration was the median time for onset of adverse effects reported to VAERS. There were&#x000a0;56 reported cases of anaphylaxis. Most occurred within&#x000a0;1 day of vaccine administration, ranging from 0&#x000a0;to 3 days. Eight hundred ninety-six deaths occurred after the administration of the Hib vaccine. According to the death certificate, the most common cause of death was sudden infant death syndrome. Importantly, there is abundant evidence that vaccines, in general, are not causally related to sudden infant death syndrome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22478.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;Although fever was the most common&#x000a0;adverse effect associated with the Hib vaccine, and this vaccine correlates with an increased risk of febrile seizures, prophylactic antipyretics are not recommended. Prophylactic antipyretics before administering the Hib vaccine have not significantly decreased rates of febrile seizures. It may even decrease the immune response to the vaccine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22478.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;It is not a current recommendation to administer antipyretics to children before administering the Hib vaccine.</p>

        <title>Contraindications</title>
        <p>Although there are reported cases of adverse events after receiving the Hib vaccine, these events are considered rare, and most are not considered contraindications for future doses of the Hib vaccine. The only current contraindication to receiving future doses of the Hib vaccine is when an individual has had a prior severe hypersensitivity reaction (such as anaphylaxis) to the vaccine or its constituents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22478.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Individuals with known severe allergies to natural rubber latex should not receive [<italic toggle="yes">Haemophilus</italic> b conjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoid&#x000a0;conjugate)], <italic toggle="yes">Haemophilus</italic> b conjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoid conjugate), or [<italic toggle="yes">Haemophilus</italic> b conjugate vaccine (meningococcal protein conjugate)]. The combination vaccine [diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis adsorbed inactivated poliovirus, and <italic toggle="yes">Haemophilus</italic> b conjugate (tetanus toxoid conjugate)] has its own set of several relative contraindications that merit consideration because it is a pertussis-containing vaccine. The only other absolute contraindication to the Hib vaccine is at least&#x000a0;6 weeks old.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22478.r8">[8]</xref></p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>The widespread use of the Hib vaccine has greatly decreased the rates of early childhood meningitis and epiglottitis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22478.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22478.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;This data may give parents the impression that the Hib vaccine is unnecessary or is not worth the risk of possible adverse effects.&#x000a0;For this reason, providers should emphasize to parents how dangerous meningitis and epiglottitis can be for their children and the low probability of significant adverse effects occurring because of the vaccine. Once parents understand that the disease processes that vaccines prevent are much more dangerous than almost all of the possible side effects, which are very rare, they may be more open to vaccinating their children. Often, patients and parents look to the nursing staff in the doctor&#x02019;s office or their neighborhood pharmacist for guidance on whether they should vaccinate their children.</p>
        <p>All healthcare team members must be consistent&#x000a0;regarding vaccination recommendations and educate the patients about how important the Hib vaccine (as well as any other vaccine) is to their child&#x02019;s health and well-being. Staying up to date on current vaccine recommendations and having recommended vaccine schedules hanging up in the office or easily accessible to the staff are helpful ways to make sure everyone is aware of the recommendations. Decreasing missed visits can help ensure that children receive their vaccinations on time. Calling parents to remind them that their child has an upcoming visit for immunizations and calling after missed appointments to reschedule immunizations could help keep children on track with their vaccinations. Providers should also carefully consider postponing vaccinations due to acute illness. Vaccinating children who attend their immunization appointments in a mild-moderately ill state is a good way to prevent them from falling behind on their vaccinations. Providers can explain to parents that this is safe and is often the better option than postponing vaccinations that protect children from more severe illnesses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22478.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>It is also essential to emphasize that the basis for the vaccination schedule for preterm or very low-birth infants is chronological age, not corrected age. Preterm infants are more likely to have an immature immune system, necessitating vaccine protection from these invasive illnesses by Haemophilus influenzae. Perhaps the most crucial aspect of vaccinations to reassure parents about in this day and age is that vaccinations do not cause or increase the risk of autism.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22478.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;These interprofessional collaborations can improve vaccination rates and patient outcomes.&#x000a0;</p>
