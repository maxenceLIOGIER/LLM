        <title>Indications</title>
        <p>Famciclovir is a prodrug antiviral agent. It is modified by esterase and an oxidase, which converts it into its active antiviral agent penciclovir. Famciclovir is the diacetyl 6-deoxy analog of penciclovir. Famciclovir is used for the treatment of acute herpes zoster (shingles) caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and herpes labialis (cold sores) caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) in immunocompetent patients. Also, famciclovir is used to treat initial and recurrent genital herpes simplex virus episodes in immunocompetent and HIV-infected patients. Also, it is an agent for the treatment of genital HSV chronic suppressive therapy. There is also evidence that famciclovir may lower hepatitis B viral DNA levels in patients when used as a long-term treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-81550.r1">[1]</xref> This data suggests that famciclovir may be useful in treating chronic hepatitis B viral infections.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-81550.r1">[1]</xref> The incidence and duration of postherpetic neuralgia are not affected in the patients treated with famciclovir for acute herpes zoster (shingles).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-81550.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>Famciclovir was introduced as a drug to increase patient compliance and ease in treating their zoster infections as it only needed to be taken three times daily as opposed to previously used medications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-81550.r1">[1]</xref> When treating oral herpes infections, famciclovir is only necessary as single-dose therapy, which increases ease for patients and contributes to improved patient compliance.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-81550.s3" sec-type="Mechanism of Action">
        <title>Mechanism of Action</title>
        <p>Famciclovir first converts into its active antiviral agent, penciclovir. The viral thymidine kinase (TK) present in cells infected with HSV-1, HSV-2, and varicella-zoster virus, phosphorylates penciclovir to a monophosphate form. Penciclovir is unable to be phosphorylated in uninfected cells and is thus selective towards virally infected cells. Further, the host cellular enzymes subsequently convert penciclovir monophosphate to triphosphate form. The penciclovir triphosphate competes with deoxyguanosine triphosphate; this inhibits the herpes virus DNA polymerase and results in chain termination, and ultimately terminates viral replication.</p>

      <sec id="article-81550.s4" sec-type="Administration">
        <title>Administration</title>
        <p>Famciclovir should be administered shortly after the signs and symptoms of a herpes zoster infection appear, or within 72 hours appearance of a varicella-zoster rash.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-81550.r1">[1]</xref> If the lesions do not progressively crust over throughout treatment, talk to your doctor about extending the regimen up to 10 days.</p>

        <p>In a dose-dependent study, there were no significant indications that increasing the dose of famciclovir caused more adverse effects.

        <p>Contraindications to famciclovir treatment include patient hypersensitivity to penciclovir and or famciclovir. This correlation is due to the similarity in chemical structure. As the kidney excretes famciclovir, clinicians should not prescribe famciclovir to a patient with renal impairment. If required, dosage adjustment is necessary. Famciclovir is safe for pregnant females and has no teratogenic effects.

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>Famciclovir has many benefits in terms of ease and effectiveness in treating zoster infections. Therapy with famciclovir is best when under the direction of an interprofessional healthcare team. Famciclovir requires a prescription from a clinician. Famciclovir is a relatively safe antiviral treatment with rare adverse side effects. However, the prescribing clinician must monitor treatment&#x000a0;with famciclovir to ensure that the patient does not experience any adverse effects. All primary care clinicians and dermatologists can prescribe famciclovir. To achieve the best results with the treatment, the patient must begin taking famciclovir treatment as soon as possible as the first signs of herpetic or varicella infections occur.</p>
        <p>Regular follow-ups with patients taking famciclovir suggest that the treatment is working properly and that there are decreased signs of infection. A pharmacist should be involved to ensure that proper dosing of famciclovir is prescribed, and the patient fully understands the treatment regimen. If the patient has any questions regarding treatment, a nurse will be able to answer most questions. Any serious concerns will be discussed between the nurse, doctor, and patient to decide how to alter care. [Level 5]</p>
