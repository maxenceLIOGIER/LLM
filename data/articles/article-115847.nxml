        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Demyelinating neuropathies can be classified as hereditary, toxic, and immune-mediated. Immune-mediated polyneuropathies can be further classified as acute and chronic, depending on the onset.&#x000a0;Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is a syndrome with several variants, with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) being the most common type of inflammatory neuropathy in North America. The pathophysiology of GBS and its variants appear to be secondary to an inflammatory process leading to molecular mimicry between central and peripheral nervous structural components and microbial/viral antigens. This condition leads to a lack of self-tolerance from the adaptive immune system and activation of neuroinflammatory processes affecting nerve conduction. The microbial and viral antigens may include<italic toggle="yes">&#x000a0;Campylobacter jejuni,</italic>&#x000a0;HIV infection, Epstein-Barr (mononucleosis), and Zika virus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-115847.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Previously, it was speculated&#x000a0;that AIDP has links with vaccinations; however, further research has refuted this association.</p>
        <p>Clinically, AIDP presents with an acute, symmetric, flaccid, and distal weakness that usually starts in the lower extremities and has an ascending pattern&#x000a0;as time progresses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-115847.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;The neurological examination&#x000a0;may show&#x000a0;facial paresis, cranial nerve/bulbar weakness, distal hyporeflexia without signs of upper motor neuron dysfunction, preserved muscle bulk, dysesthesias, allodynia, or&#x000a0;neuropathic pain, and loss of light and vibratory sensation in the affected&#x000a0;extremities. Motor symptoms and signs tend to predominate over sensory ones. Autonomic symptoms may be present, such as hypertension or hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The latter can present in those with an advanced and severe disease course.&#x000a0;It has a monophasic course with varying onset, progression, and recovery degrees. Imaging may show hyperintense and hypertrophic nerves, especially in caudal nerve roots in the lumbar spine.</p>
        <p>Further evaluation includes a lumbar puncture, often showing albuminocytologic dissociation (0 cells and high cerebrospinal [CSF] protein without signs of infection). However, some patients may not have positive CSF findings until&#x000a0;3 weeks into the disease course. A smaller percentage of patients may have unremarkable CSF results. In summary, diagnosing&#x000a0;AIDP requires a thorough history and physical exam, screening of risk factors, lumbar spine imaging, comprehensive CSF studies to discard alternate diagnoses, and ancillary electrodiagnostic studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-115847.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>Electrodiagnostic&#x000a0;studies can support the diagnosis and prognosticate the patient's course when an AIDP is suspected. They can help localize a lesion (eg, bulbar, peripheral, neuromuscular junction, muscle), and discern the extent of the pathology and etiology (eg, autoimmune, axonal, myopathic, etc). They are considered an extension of the neurological exam, providing valuable information about nerve conduction, muscle-nerve connections, and structural integrity of the myelinated sensory and motor fibers. AIDP can affect axons in more severe cases, which may have a worse prognosis. This&#x000a0;topic&#x000a0;focuses on the findings typical of acute demyelinating polyneuropathies.&#x000a0;</p>

        <title>Anatomy and Physiology</title>
        <p>Neurons are responsible for receiving, integrating, and propagating the summation of excitatory and inhibitory electrical potentials from other cells. Neurons are composed of dendrites, bodies, and axons. Dendrites receive information from other neurons and serve a critical role in neuroplasticity. The neurons contain the euchromatic nucleus and organelles responsible for producing proteins and chemicals essential for proper neurotransmission at the synapse. Polyribosomes are clustered and are visible under electron microscopy as Nissl bodies.&#x000a0;Axons serve as the conductor and transmit information to other individuals or networks of neurons, glands, and muscles. The axonal fibers terminate at the synapse with the electrochemical activation of a complex and diverse quantity of ligand-gated or G-coupled receptors that vary according to the effector organ.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Physiology of Nerve Conduction </bold>
</p>
        <p>At rest, neurons have an intracellular resting membrane potential of -70 mV, which reflects a steady-state concentration of sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) ions intracellularly and extracellularly. This state is maintained through the cells' passive and active energy (ATP) expending receptors. During depolarization,&#x000a0;there is an influx of Na+ ions (given higher concentration extracellularly) via partial voltage-gated sodium channels that open and lead to a propagating stimulation once they reach a positive voltage potential. At the peak of the action potential, voltage-gated Na+ channels close, and voltage-gated potassium K+ channels open, leading to the exit of ions from inside to outside the cell through a concentration gradient, which leads to the hyperpolarization of cells. A Na+/K+-ATPase in the neurons brings the ion gradient back to baseline (to resting potential) by&#x000a0;expending energy to expel 3 Na+ out of the cell for 2 K+ inside the cell. The nerve conduction is coordinated with directionality and propagation of depolarization throughout the entire axon, with ultimate activation or inhibition of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Unmyelinated fibers conduct in the range of 1&#x000a0;to 5 meters&#x000a0;per second. On the other hand, myelinated motor and sensory nerve axons have conduction velocities up to 150 meters&#x000a0;per second. This process is called saltatory conduction. Myelin production occurs via Schwann cells, which concentrically wrap around axons. These&#x000a0;myelin&#x000a0;sheaths have gaps called nodes of Ranvier, where action potentials occur and propagate quickly until encountering the next node. Therefore, current flows passively and jumps from node to node.</p>
        <p>During AIDP, the autoimmune&#x000a0;target can predict the electrodiagnostic findings, prognosis, and clinical presentation. The most common target is the myelinated sheaths across the axon and within Schwann cells, leading to decreased conduction velocity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-115847.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;Although less common, nerve axon fibers can also be targets. This activity leads to axonal injuries that can decrease action potential amplitudes and lead to abnormal nerve-muscle connections.&#x000a0;</p>

<bold> Nerve conduction studies </bold>
</p>
        <p>Nerve conduction studies (NCS) can help to&#x000a0;evaluate large&#x000a0;myelinated sensory and motor fibers.&#x000a0;Small myelinated fibers in the autonomic and spinothalamic tracts need specialized studies for neuropathy evaluation. The NCS does not pick these up (eg, quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test-QSART, useful to diagnose type II diabetes mellitus polyneuropathy). NCS should be performed in ideal conditions, including room temperature, as it can affect latency, duration, and amplitude measurements. NCS is an electrodiagnostic study that measures the summated action potentials of sensory (SNAPs) and motor muscle fibers (CMAPs). It has multiple important measurements to review:</p>

        <p>An electromyogram (EMG)&#x000a0;measures the integrity of the nerve-muscle connections when electrical stimulation is applied, with an anatomical evaluation of nerves, roots, and plexuses.

        <p>For AIDP, NCS, and EMG, studies should occur no earlier than&#x000a0;3 weeks after the onset of clinical symptoms to avoid false negatives and increase the specificity of the studies. Electrodiagnostic testing can also rule out other superimposed or isolated neuromuscular disorders in the differential, which can include cervical&#x000a0;or lumbar radiculopathies or myelopathies, myopathies, neuronopathies, small or large fiber peripheral neuropathy, motor neuron disease, and neuromuscular junction disorders.&#x000a0;These differentials are defined as follows:&#x000a0;</p>

        <p>Before performing any diagnostic study, a comprehensive review of the patient&#x02019;s history, clinical course, and a complete physical exam must be performed. The diagnostician informs the patient's bedside of the indications and provides an overview of the studies needed to diagnose AIDP with proper electrodiagnostic testing.</p>
        <p>The diagnostician must thoroughly explain the risks and benefits of the exam to the patient and get consent from the patient. For comparison, one should ideally examine at least 3 extremities, performing sensory and motor nerve conduction studies and EMG needle testing in both proximal and distal muscles. A notch filter should be used to minimize the electrical interference that can occur while doing the study bedside, and, if possible, all unnecessary machines should be turned off, including unplugging the clinic/hospital bed.</p>

        <p>NCS may show the sparing of the sural nerves.&#x000a0;F-wave studies, while normally limited in their utility in many pathologies, are particularly useful in testing for AIDP. F-wave testing can detect early inflammation proximally at the nerve roots. Because the F-wave tests the entire nerve length, it can detect abnormalities clinicians would otherwise miss with standard segmental nerve conduction studies. Also, F-ratios may increase, suggesting greater proximal demyelination compared to distal.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-115847.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>Needle electromyography is usually unremarkable in AIDP because most cases are demyelinating and not axonal. However, with axonal involvement, EMG studies may demonstrate signs of active denervation, PSWs/fibrillation potentials, increased duration, amplitude, and fiber reinnervation signs.</p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>Acute demyelinating polyneuropathy is a condition often seen in the inpatient setting and sometimes requires outpatient follow-up. Patients frequently complain of pain, weakness, paresthesias, and weakness in the extremities. Imaging, cerebrospinal, and electrodiagnostic studies are routinely ordered. Physicians must be cautious, as imaging findings might not correlate with the patient's symptoms.</p>
        <p>It is essential to take an interprofessional team including a team of physicians (general neurologists, neuromuscular neurologists, physical medicine and rehabilitation, pain management physicians), therapists (physical and occupational therapists), social workers, and case managers who can work together to coordinate mobilization with outpatient therapy and aggressive multifaceted rehabilitation so we can improve a patient's functional status.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-115847.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;If the axonal injury is severe and prolonged, a long and difficult recovery could occur. A coordinated effort between the various medical disciplines and departments can provide the best outcomes for patients.</p>
