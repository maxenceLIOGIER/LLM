        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>The demand for body contouring procedures is on the rise worldwide, especially in the United States (US), where over a third of the population is obese. Approximately 10% of Americans are eligible for weight loss surgery, with around 256,000 undergoing bariatric surgery annually.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-161515.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-161515.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;While weight loss surgery is highly effective for improving overall health, it often results in excess skin around the lower trunk, creating a deflated appearance. Postpregnancy changes can also lead to a similar aesthetic. The presence of redundant skin folds can lead to dermatitis, hygiene issues, infections, and clothing and physical activity challenges. Moreover, excess skin and fat can contribute to psychosocial concerns, commonly alleviated through body contouring procedures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-161515.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>Following the trend, there has been a consistent increase in the demand for body contouring procedures. In 2020 alone, American surgeons performed 46,577 such procedures on individuals who had undergone significant weight loss.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/y7zNfV/6AFx">[2]</ext-link> While traditional abdominoplasty, or "tummy tuck," has been the go-to option for addressing excess skin around the lower trunk in massive weight loss patients, it often falls short in addressing issues like flank and back rolls, leading to less-than-desirable cosmetic outcomes. Consequently, belt lipectomy is preferred for a more comprehensive lower body contouring solution.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/y7zNfV/6AFx">[4]</ext-link></p>
        <p>Removing excess skin and fat from the abdomen dates back to the early 1800s when it was primarily used for wound coverage, with little attention paid to scar placement or the resulting body contour. The first documented panniculectomy, then known as "dermolipectomy," took place in 1890 in France by Demars and Marx.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-161515.r3">[3]</xref> French surgeons later refined the technique to include procedures that preserved the umbilicus. The US saw its first reported cases of abdominal contouring and cosmetic abdominoplasty in 1899, performed by Kelly and a team of gynecologists at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-161515.r3">[3]</xref> In 1924, Thorek conducted what is believed to be the first umbilicus-preserving abdominoplasty, using a low transverse incision and umbilical transposition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-161515.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;The belt lipectomy, introduced by Somalo from Argentina in 1940, marked a significant advancement in body contouring procedures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-161515.r3">[3]</xref> In 1991, Dr Lockwood introduced the lateral tension abdominoplasty, emphasizing crucial concepts for successful trunk contouring, such as the superficial fascial system (SFS).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-161515.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>Body contouring of the lower trunk encompasses various procedures that serve distinct purposes. A belt lipectomy, also known as circumferential body lift, lower body lift, or torsoplasty, involves the removal of excess skin and fat around the lower trunk to enhance contour and reduce skin laxity. This comprehensive procedure often includes formal abdominoplasty, a "tummy tuck," which entails extensive undermining through the epigastric region, relocation of the umbilicus, and rectus diastasis plication. Belt lipectomy may be coded as an additional procedure alongside abdominoplasty or panniculectomy. Both belt lipectomy and abdominoplasty are typically considered cosmetic surgeries.</p>
        <p>Conversely, panniculectomy&#x000a0;focuses solely on removing the panniculus (excess skin and fat) without relocating the umbilicus or extensive undermining. This procedure is often medically necessary to alleviate symptoms such as intertriginous rash or functional issues. Due to this medical necessity, panniculectomy may be covered by insurance.</p>
        <p>The distinction between cosmetic and medically necessary procedures often results in insurance companies not covering belt lipectomy and abdominoplasty, while panniculectomy stands a better chance of being covered. In cases where a patient desires both cosmetic improvement and medical necessity, it may be appropriate to discuss insurance billing for panniculectomy while opting for self-payment to cover the additional surgeon's fee and operating room time required to complete the belt lipectomy.</p>

        <title>Anatomy and Physiology</title>
        <p>Understanding the blood supply to the abdominal wall skin and subcutaneous tissue is crucial for minimizing the risk of wound healing complications. Huger identified&#x000a0;3 zones of perfusion that divide the abdominal wall:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Zone 1: The first zone covers the central tissue overlying the rectus abdominis muscles and is primarily supplied by the superior and inferior epigastric artery system perforators.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Zone 2: The second zone extends inferiorly from a horizontal line connecting the anterior superior iliac spines and is predominantly supplied by the superficial inferior epigastric and superficial circumflex iliac systems.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Zone 3: The third zone includes the lateral aspects, including the flanks, and receives blood from intercostal, subcostal, and lumbar perforating vessels.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>When making a lower abdominal transverse incision, the blood supply to the abdominal wall in zone 2 is disrupted. Similarly, during the central abdominal flap undermining to the level of the xiphoid for diastasis plication and downward mobility, the blood supply in zone&#x000a0;1 is mainly divided. However, the transition between zones&#x000a0;1 and&#x000a0;3 requires more cautious undermining, with a perforator-sparing approach employed as necessary. When liposuction is incorporated into the procedure, surgeons must maintain a similar level of caution and awareness regarding the anatomy of perforators to minimize the risk of compromising the blood supply to the abdominal wall.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-161515.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-161515.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Proper layered closure of the abdominal incision emphasizing the SFS can off-load tension from the skin, close down dead space, and enhance healing. The SFS comprises loose, vaguely defined Camper fascia superficially and denser, more obvious Scarpa fascia below.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-161515.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>

      <sec id="article-161515.s7" sec-type="Preparation">
        <title>Preparation</title>
        <p>Given that belt lipectomy is an elective procedure, it's essential to conduct a thorough preoperative evaluation to ensure patient safety and optimize surgical outcomes. The patient's medical team should address any cardiopulmonary or medical issues before surgery. As previously discussed, severe or unstable medical comorbidities such as cirrhosis, uncontrolled diabetes, renal failure, unstable coronary artery disease, and heart failure are considered contraindications to belt lipectomy due to the increased risk of complications.</p>
        <p>Smoking is often regarded as an absolute contraindication by many plastic surgeons, as it can impair wound healing and increase the risk of surgical complications. Patients are typically advised to stop smoking at least&#x000a0;1 month before the scheduled surgery to minimize these risks. Bariatric surgery patients may have nutritional deficiencies due to malabsorption, which should be corrected before undergoing belt lipectomy. Proper nutritional management helps optimize wound healing and reduce the risk of postoperative complications.</p>
        <p>When obtaining the patient's history concerning their weight loss journey, it's essential to gather information about their highest weight, lowest weight, and the duration of their current weight. Additionally, discussing the patient's further weight loss goals is crucial. Performing a belt lipectomy on a patient still losing weight may result in premature reaccumulation of skin excess. Similarly, if a patient is planning to have more children, undergoing a belt lipectomy before completing their family may lead to the recurrence of skin laxity. In such cases, waiting until childbearing is over and the patient's weight loss goals have been achieved and maintained for at least&#x000a0;6 months to&#x000a0;1 year before considering a belt lipectomy is advisable. This waiting period stabilizes the patient's weight and body contours, reducing the risk of additional surgeries due to further weight loss or changes in body shape.&#x000a0;This also ensures optimal long-term outcomes and patient satisfaction with the procedure's results.</p>
        <p>Patients who have undergone massive weight loss may present with various types of skin and fat excess, including vertical, horizontal, or a combination of both, sometimes accompanied by intraabdominal fat accumulation that remains unaddressed by certain procedures. Vertical skin excess can result in panniculus formation, mons pubis ptosis, and rolls around the sides and back, while horizontal excess can contribute to a loss of waist contour. During the physical examination, assessing for rectus diastasis and the presence of hernias is essential. Additionally, buttock deflation, thigh laxity, and lipodystrophy should be noted, as they can also be addressed during belt lipectomy.</p>
        <p>When planning a belt lipectomy procedure, careful consideration must be given to the positioning and potential impact of existing scars, particularly those over the abdomen and back. Scars from previous surgeries, such as Kocher or chevron subcostal incisions, can affect the vascularity of the abdominal skin flap, which is critical for successful wound healing and flap viability. Midline scars may also present challenges and may require revision at the time of belt lipectomy, with consideration given to converting them to a fleur-de-lis type excision to optimize aesthetic outcomes and minimize tension on the wound closure.&#x000a0;By addressing existing scars proactively and optimizing incision placement during belt lipectomy, surgeons can mitigate potential complications and optimize the overall aesthetic result for the patient.</p>
        <p>Belt lipectomy is often performed in the outpatient setting. The anesthesia team may administer a transversus abdominis or erector spinae plane block to enhance patient comfort and facilitate recovery. These regional anesthesia techniques can reduce intraoperative and postoperative narcotic use while improving pain scores after surgery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-161515.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;A single dose of preoperative low-molecular-weight heparin is typically administered as a precaution against thromboembolic events. Additionally, preoperative antibiotics are given to reduce the risk of surgical site infections. Tranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic agent, may be considered to minimize blood loss during liposuction and body contouring procedures associated with belt lipectomy. TXA can be applied topically, infiltrated into tissues, or administered systemically before, during, or after surgery. However, further research is needed to establish the optimal protocol for TXA use in these procedures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-161515.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>The crux of the case is the marking of the belt lipectomy patient. This&#x000a0;begins in the preoperative area, where the patient stands and slightly flexes at the waist to tension the eventual back closure appropriately. This moment also offers an opportunity to review patient expectations and ensure clarity regarding the areas to be addressed and the location of scars.</p>
        <p>The marking process notes vital landmarks such as the midline from the xiphoid to the pubis and the anterior superior iliac spines. Anterior markings involve pulling down the mobile panniculus to estimate the excise amount at the proposed lower incision. However, the final decision on the extent of excision is made intraoperatively after confirming that closure is feasible without excessive tension. Conversely, the marking strategy for the posterior aspect is different. The upper incision is marked first as the static area, followed by pulling the excess buttock and lateral thigh skin upward to approximate and mark the extent of the excision. This method ensures the markings accurately reflect the planned excision and contouring of the back and lateral thigh areas.</p>

        <p>General anesthesia is induced with the patient in the supine position. A Foley catheter is inserted, and sequential compression devices are applied to prevent deep vein thrombosis. Pubic hair is removed with clippers, and the patient's hips are positioned at the level of the bed articulation to facilitate later flexion. Belt lipectomy often requires&#x000a0;3 position changes throughout the procedure to effectively access different areas of the body. First, the patient is positioned in lateral decubitus on a beanbag with proper padding and skin preparation using chlorhexidine. Second, the patient is moved to the opposite lateral decubitus position, and the preparation process is repeated. Finally, the case concludes with the patient in the supine position, prepared and draped for the final stages of the surgery. Depending on surgeon preference, patient positioning may vary, including an awake standing skin preparation circumferentially before induction. These variations aim to optimize access to the surgical site and ensure the best possible outcomes.</p>
        <p>After the patient is positioned supine and anesthesia is induced, the operator stands to the patient's right and retracts the panniculus using the left forearm. Markings are made approximately 5 to 10 cm above the pubis within the hair-bearing area. The left side and then&#x000a0;the right side of the lower abdominal pannus&#x000a0;are retracted, with the left forearm pulling up the thigh skin. Equal tension is applied to each side to mark the proposed lower incision static area, extending just over the&#x000a0;anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and laterally connecting with the flank incisions. Symmetry is ensured in the proposed incision. The upper incision may be remarked but is finalized after undermining to provide a minimally tensioned closure.</p>
        <p>The procedure typically starts in the lateral decubitus position with the leg abducted. One flank and side of the back are completed, ensuring that skin from the thigh and gluteal region reaches the proposed static point of the lower back before transection. Minimal posterior undermining is performed to preserve blood flow and minimize dead space. Additional mobility may be achieved using the Lockwood elevator. Gluteal auto-augmentation and liposuction are considered if necessary.</p>
        <p>After closure and dressing of the surgical site, the patient is repositioned to the opposite lateral decubitus position for a repeat procedure, followed by supine positioning. Liposuction and cautious flap thinning may be performed if needed. The umbilicus is incised and isolated to the fascia/linea alba level. The lower incision is made, and the abdominal flap is raised, working superiorly and centrally within Huger perfusion zone 1, protecting the umbilicus and preserving perforators when possible. This dissection proceeds to the level of the xiphoid.</p>
        <p>With the patient flexed to about 30 degrees, the abdominal flap is stretched inferiorly to remark the upper extent of transection before removal. Diastasis is marked out and plicated with buried figure-of-8 0 ethibond sutures. The abdomen is stapled closed, and the neoumbilical site is marked at the level of the ASIS. The abdominal flap is quilted with progressive tension to the underlying fascia to close down dead space and off-load the eventual skin closure using&#x000a0;2 double-armed 0 polydioxanone (PDS) knotless control sutures. The umbilicus is brought out through the marked area and sutured. The flap can be thinned, and the umbilical stalk can be plicated to reduce height, creating&#x000a0;a naturally-appearing umbilical depression. Drains may be used but are optional with progressive tension suturing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-161515.r10">[10]</xref> Layered closure, including the SFS, is carried out carefully.&#x000a0;Skin adhesive may be used over the incisions for added strength and waterproofing. An abdominal binder is helpful postoperatively, and early ambulation is encouraged while in a beach chair position in bed.</p>

        <title>Complications</title>
        <p>A meta-analysis from 2016 included 28 studies and 1380 patients undergoing belt lipectomy and found an overall complication rate of 37%. The most common complications included seroma (13%) and wound dehiscence (17%). Other notable complications included infection (5%), skin necrosis (4%), hematoma (3%), and&#x000a0;deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolus (3%).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-161515.r11">[11]</xref></p>

        <p>The psychological benefits of body contouring procedures in appropriate patient populations have been extensively documented. Effective expectation management and thorough informed consent are essential in ensuring patient satisfaction. Research indicates that individuals who have undergone body contouring surgery following significant weight loss experience substantial improvements in health-related quality of life and satisfaction with their appearance over a 10-year follow-up period compared to those who did not.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-161515.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>However, it's important to note that weight regain is a common issue in this patient population, regardless of whether they have undergone bariatric surgery. A study tracking body contouring patients over 12 years revealed an average weight regain of 11.8% among those who underwent bariatric surgery and 7.6% among those who did not.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-161515.r13">[13]</xref> This underscores the importance of ongoing support and strategies for weight maintenance following body contouring procedures.</p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>The healthcare team caring for a belt lipectomy case encompasses various professionals, each crucial in ensuring comprehensive care and optimal outcomes. The primary care provider, including advanced practitioners, serves as a central figure, assisting with preoperative medical clearance and optimizing medical conditions, such as glycemic control, to minimize surgical risks. Surgeons are crucial&#x000a0;in performing the surgical procedure with precision and skill, ensuring that patient expectations are managed and informed consent is obtained. Anesthesiologists contribute through preoperative evaluations to ascertain the patient's fitness for general anesthesia and determine the appropriateness of regional blocks, ensuring safe anesthesia administration during surgery. Nurses are instrumental in preoperative assessment, patient education, and postoperative care, closely monitoring patients for any signs of complications and providing support throughout the recovery process.</p>
        <p>Pharmacists contribute by ensuring the appropriate selection and administration of medications, including preoperative antibiotics and pain management regimens, to enhance patient comfort and safety. A nutritionist collaborates with the team to address potential nutritional deficiencies in postbariatric surgery patients, ensuring they maintain a healthy lifestyle through proper diet and exercise. Psychiatric or therapy follow-up is essential to assess and stabilize mental health conditions, providing necessary emotional support perioperatively. Professional communication among team members facilitates seamless care coordination, allowing for the timely exchange of information and collaborative decision-making. By fostering a culture of teamwork and open communication, healthcare professionals can collectively optimize patient-centered care, achieve favorable outcomes, prioritize patient safety, and enhance overall team performance in the context of belt lipectomy procedures.</p>
