        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>An abscess usually forms following a severe inflammatory reaction to an infectious process. It is a collection of purulent material, including cellular debris, liquified tissue from infective agents, bacteria, leukocytes, and enzymes.&#x000a0;A prostatic abscess is a localized collection of purulent fluid within the prostate, often forming as a complication of acute bacterial prostatitis.&#x000a0;The first reported case was described by Allison in 1842 and resulted in the patient's death.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;It is difficult to clinically distinguish acute bacterial prostatitis from a prostatic abscess based solely on the presenting symptoms, history, and physical examination.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;A prostatic abscess can cause severe urosepsis and septic shock resulting in death if appropriate measures are not taken in a timely fashion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>Acute bacterial prostatitis typically affects men aged 20 to 40 years and over 60. Symptoms are generally acute and include urinary frequency, perineal pain, and dysuria. The urine will be infected, and there will usually be systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, chills, and muscle aches. Many patients will have difficulty in urination or even urinary retention. Patients doing intermittent catheterization are at increased risk with a lifetime probability of up to 33%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;Any male patient who presents with a urinary tract infection and a fever should be considered at risk for acute bacterial prostatitis.</p>
        <p>In modern medicine, the&#x000a0;number of prostatic abscess patients has considerably declined due to the&#x000a0;judicious use of antibiotics.&#x000a0;However, prostatic abscesses are still relatively common in&#x000a0;developing countries and in high-risk patients like&#x000a0;those men who have undergone urological procedures such as prostate biopsies. Other men at high risk include those with significant chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on hemodialysis, liver cirrhosis, cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, transplant recipients, HIV/AIDS patients, men with inadequately treated benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and others with immunodeficiency.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;Due to the lack of clear investigative and treatment guidelines and the fact that it is now relatively rare, a prostatic abscess can be a diagnostic and management challenge in the real world, leading to significant morbidity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;In addition, many physicians are relatively unfamiliar with it, having seen very few cases due to its infrequent presentation.&#x000a0;</p>

        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>A prostatic abscess often develops as a complication of acute prostatitis, primarily from reflux of infected urine into the prostatic ducts during voiding. Generally,&#x000a0;they occur in patients with poorly controlled diabetes or a compromised immune system. Over 50 percent of patients with prostatic abscesses are diabetics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r7">[7]</xref> Though rare in the modern antibiotic era, patients who are not treated appropriately or adequately for acute prostatitis are at high risk of developing an abscess. Men at risk for prostate abscess include those&#x000a0;with chronic foley or suprapubic catheters, neurogenic bladder dysfunction, poorly controlled diabetes, liver cirrhosis, ESRD, or immunosuppressed patients, including those who are HIV positive. Patients who do intermittent self-catheterization or have bladder outlet obstruction are also more prone to prostatic abscess formation. Any significant type of underlying voiding&#x000a0;dysfunction, either from neurological diseases or due to&#x000a0;severe benign prostatic hyperplasia and some forms of pelvic injury, also places patients at higher risk. In recent trends, prostatic abscesses occurring as complications after prostate biopsies are becoming more commonly reported in the medical literature despite the increasingly widespread use of antibiotics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>In literature from the pre-antibiotic era, sexually transmitted organisms like&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>&#x000a0;and <italic toggle="yes">Chlamydia</italic> were commonly identified pathogens in prostatic abscesses.

        <p>In general, older men will develop a prostatic abscess as a complication of a prostate biopsy, benign prostatic hyperplasia, or inadequately treated acute bacterial prostatitis. Often patients will have a good initial response to antibiotic treatment.&#x000a0;Several studies have shown that about 10% of men who present with prostatic abscesses had recently undergone prostate biopsies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r16">[16]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r17">[17]</xref>&#x000a0;It has also developed after prostatic cryotherapy, brachytherapy, intravesical BCG therapy, and other types of urological instrumentation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;Risk factors include poorly controlled diabetes and an immunocompromised state. Patients at risk will often present in a debilitated state or with other signs of poor general health.</p>
        <p>A prostate abscess may be the first sign of an underlying chronic or debilitating medical condition in younger men.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;For example, 17 to 25% of younger men presenting with a prostatic abscess were found to have previously undiagnosed diabetes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r18">[18]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-27832.s4" sec-type="Epidemiology">
        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>The overall incidence of prostatic abscess can be as high as 0.5% of all urologic diseases; the mortality rate is between 1% and 16%, and approximately 6% of all acute bacterial prostatitis patients will develop a prostatic abscess.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r19">[19]</xref>&#x000a0;Generally, older age group patients are affected more frequently due to a higher incidence of underlying medical risk factors and a greater likelihood of urological procedures like prostate biopsies in this age group.

Also, younger men who develop prostatic abscesses are likely to have a previously undiagnosed chronic medical condition.</p>

      <sec id="article-27832.s5" sec-type="Pathophysiology">
        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>Typically, the pathogenesis of a prostatic abscess is due to suboptimally treated acute or chronic bacterial prostatitis. Infection of prostatic tissue occurs as a result of the reflux of infected urine into the prostatic ducts, or there may be direct contamination through a transrectal needle during a prostate biopsy. Inadequate antibiotic prophylaxis and systemic risk factors that promote infections result in acute/chronic bacterial prostatitis and/or a prostatic abscess. Other localized infections predisposing patients to a&#x000a0;prostatic abscess include urinary tract infections, epididymitis,&#x000a0;gonorrhea, and pyelonephritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r20">[20]</xref>&#x000a0;Hematogenous dissemination from a distant primary infected focus such as a liver abscess, abrasion, bronchitis, otitis, perirenal abscess, appendicitis, diverticulitis, boils, or other skin and subcutaneous infections causing bacteremia, primarily due to <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> could also lead to prostatic abscess formation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;A prostatic abscess has also been reported following the placement of hydrogel spacers prior to radiation therapy for prostate cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r21">[21]</xref></p>
        <p>Infrequently, an emphysematous prostatic abscess can develop from a urinary tract infection with gas-forming organisms, particularly in patients with poorly controlled diabetes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r22">[22]</xref>&#x000a0;While rare, such cases of emphysematous prostatic abscesses demonstrate more rapid disease progression and a very high mortality rate of 25%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r22">[22]</xref>&#x000a0;Early diagnostic imaging in suspected cases will usually clearly demonstrate gas in the prostate or bladder wall. Typical gas-forming organisms include <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, </italic>and<italic toggle="yes"> Staphylococcus aureus.</italic></p>

      <sec id="article-27832.s6" sec-type="History and Physical">
        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>A comprehensive history of all underlying medical illnesses and any immunocompromising risk factors should be promptly obtained in all cases of bacterial prostatitis. This helps to evaluate the potential risks of developing a prostate abscess. The persistence of symptoms in acute or chronic bacterial prostatitis, especially in patients with high-risk factors or inadequate prior treatment, should alert clinicians to the need to evaluate for an abscess. As this pathology commonly derives from an&#x000a0;ascending urinary tract infection, patients present with a range of urinary symptoms like increased urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, hematuria, and urethral burning. In some cases, patients can present with difficulty in urination or even acute urinary retention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r23">[23]</xref>&#x000a0;More specifically, perineal discomfort should point towards a prostatic etiology. Other&#x000a0;systemic manifestations&#x000a0;of an infectious etiology are evident by fever, chills, myalgias, and low back pain. Terminal hematuria and the expression of frank pus from the urethra are possible but uncommon presenting symptoms. Up to a third of patients may present with systemic signs of infection only.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r10">[10]</xref></p>
        <p>Physical examination findings that may present in the presence of a prostate abscess are a purulent urethral discharge, painful digital rectal examination, and possible&#x000a0;fluctuant areas in the prostate. Unfortunately, the mere finding of a sore, swollen and tender prostate does not distinguish a prostatic abscess from prostatitis, and fluctuance is found in as few as 16% of prostatic abscess cases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r24">[24]</xref>&#x000a0;Virtually all patients will have a sore, tender prostate on a digital rectal exam, and over 90% will demonstrate both leukocytosis and pyuria.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r25">[25]</xref>&#x000a0;Besides being quite painful for the patient, the digital rectal examination&#x000a0;risks exacerbating the infection and possible sepsis. Therefore, clinicians should be highly suspicious of the presence of a prostatic abscess in any patient with acute prostatitis who is high risk due to presentation, comorbidities, or who fails to respond quickly (within 48 hours) to treatment.</p>

      <sec id="article-27832.s7" sec-type="Evaluation">
        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>The diagnosis of a prostatic abscess based solely on history and physical&#x000a0;findings is difficult because the symptoms are non-specific and overlap with other lower urinary tract pathology. A high level of clinical suspicion, particularly in non-responding acute prostatitis patients, is necessary for early diagnosis and timely management.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Patients with acute prostatitis who do not respond to treatment after 48 hours should be evaluated for a possible prostatic abscess.</bold>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r19">[19]</xref>
</p>
        <p>Due to its rare incidence and non-specific clinical features, the diagnosis of a prostatic abscess is often delayed.&#x000a0;Necessary&#x000a0;investigations include a complete blood count with differential, CMP, urinalysis, and blood and urine cultures used to evaluate underlying infectious diseases and chronic medical conditions and identify the source of infection. If there is any suspicion of a prostate abscess based on history and physical findings or basic laboratory results, imaging studies&#x000a0;should be obtained. Imaging studies confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment by assisting in drainage procedures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r23">[23]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r26">[26]</xref>&#x000a0;Prostatic imaging can be obtained by a transrectal prostate ultrasound, CT scan, or prostatic MRI.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) is usually the initial diagnostic test for a prostate abscess. It can accurately identify a prostatic abscess in at least 80% of affected patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r27">[27]</xref> Findings of&#x000a0;hypoechoic&#x000a0;areas with&#x000a0;well-defined walls and septations suggest an abscess.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r23">[23]</xref>&#x000a0;They are typically found in the transitional and central zones. Ultrasound also has the advantage of allowing immediate treatment through transrectal needle aspiration of the abscess for therapeutic drainage as well as culture. (Aspiration requires a large-bore needle of at least 18 gauge). Transrectal ultrasound is inexpensive, avoids radiation exposure, is familiar to most urologists, and is readily available. However, transrectal ultrasound can be uncomfortable for the patient, is very operator dependent, does not indicate spread outside the prostate, and may involve significant manipulation of an infected organ.</p>
        <p>Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis (with and without IV contrast) can better delineate the spread of any prostatic infection to adjacent organs and is especially useful in more severe cases or sicker patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r28">[28]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r29">[29]</xref>&#x000a0;The imaging modality of choice is for emphysematous prostatic abscesses, as the gas/fluid mixture is clearly visualized.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r22">[22]</xref>&#x000a0;CT scans can also identify enlarged lymph nodes, but this is often a non-specific finding. It can also be difficult to differentiate small abscesses from benign cystic prostatic nodules using CT scanning alone. Confirmation can be obtained from a transrectal ultrasound if necessary.</p>
        <p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can also be used for prostatic imaging, even in very sick patients. The MRI demonstrates an&#x000a0;abscess as a hypointense area on the T1 weighted image and hyperintense on the T2 weighted image.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r30">[30]</xref>&#x000a0;The abscess will typically appear as a cystic lesion with thick walls. The interior may be septated or heterogeneous. A prostatic abscess will generally appear as an area of restricted diffusion, which correlates with the T2 weighted lesion. Contrast-enhanced MRI will easily show thick-walled fluid collections and is very useful in detecting local extraprostatic extensions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r31">[31]</xref>&#x000a0;In general, an MRI has better soft-tissue resolution and diagnostic accuracy than CT scan images and is more sensitive than transrectal ultrasound in the very early stages of abscess formation, where ultrasound is often inconclusive.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r30">[30]</xref>&#x000a0;The use of MRI image targeting together with transrectal ultrasound fusion guidance can greatly assist transrectal aspiration by making the target abscess more visible than with ultrasound guidance alone. While magnetic resonance imaging is generally improved with the help of endorectal coils, such implements are often too large and painful for use in patients with prostatic abscesses and acute prostatitis. However, an external phased-array pelvic/prostatic MRI antenna is commercially available and greatly improves image quality and resolution in both 1.5 and 3 Tesla MRI machines without the need for an endorectal coil.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r32">[32]</xref>&#x000a0;(Such an array is most often used to enhance imaging for improved prostate cancer detection.)&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>In summary, high-risk (immunocompromised) acute prostatitis patients and immunocompetent patients with acute prostatitis who fail to improve within 48 hours of initial treatment should be evaluated for a prostatic abscess. Only a targeted imaging study (transrectal ultrasound of the prostate, CT scan, or prostatic MRI) can confirm the diagnosis as the clinical signs of prostatic abscess are indistinguishable from acute bacterial prostatitis. While transrectal ultrasonography is usually the initial imaging study, consideration should also be given to a prostatic MRI as it avoids radiation exposure, easily identifies extraprostatic extensions, and provides clear, detailed images of the prostate without the need for any prostatic manipulation from a transrectal probe. MRI-transrectal ultrasound fusion guidance is available, if needed, to assist with the transrectal aspiration of the abscess.</p>

        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>Early diagnosis is important because prostatic abscesses require prolonged treatment protocols and sometimes surgical drainage. While surgical procedures are not necessary in all&#x000a0;cases&#x000a0;of&#x000a0;prostate abscesses, drainage procedures have been shown to limit the duration of antibiotics required, shorten hospitalizations, and enhance voiding function.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Even though currently there are no strict guidelines or algorithms for the&#x000a0;management of prostatic abscesses, expert consensus, as discussed below, is the guiding standard.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Once there is clinical suspicion of a prostate abscess, a diagnostic evaluation takes place with transrectal ultrasonography or alternate prostate imaging modality to determine the size, number, extent, and exact location of any abscesses. Conservative management is reasonable for abscesses up to 1 cm in diameter. Conservative treatment can be done between 1 cm and 2 cm in diameter, but surgical aspiration and drainage will generally speed recovery and reduce hospitalization time.</p>
        <p>Conservatively treated patients should be closely monitored as they may need a surgical drainage procedure if no significant improvement occurs. Patients not responding to initial ultrasound-guided drainage should have additional imaging, such as a CT scan or MRI, to rule out extraprostatic spread of the abscess, in which case open drainage may be warranted.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;According to the available literature, smaller abscesses (less than 2 cm in diameter)&#x000a0;responded well to medical management, whereas larger abscesses (more than 2 cm in diameter) responded better with surgical unroofing, transurethral prostate resection, or similar drainage procedures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r33">[33]</xref></p>
        <p>Smaller abscesses, typically 2 cm or less, may respond to non-operative treatment, but complete resolution is likely to take longer without a surgical drainage procedure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;Conservative management includes broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics necessitating inpatient hospital admission. Empiric antibiotic therapy should initially be targeted mainly toward gram-negative organisms. The antibiotic adjustment could be through urine cultures and Gram stain results&#x000a0;showing&#x000a0;evidence to suspect another etiology like gram-positive&#x000a0;bacteria or rare causes such as fungal organisms. Commonly used first-line antibiotics are levofloxacin (renal adjusted dose), broad-spectrum&#x000a0;beta-lactam penicillin, or a cephalosporin. The addition of an aminoglycoside (tobramycin 5 mg/kg daily) in the initial treatment regimen should be considered, depending on the severity of the disease. A minimum two-week course of antibiotics is required for complete resolution, although four weeks is the traditionally recommended duration of medical therapy. Many men require a longer course of treatment, with the average patient receiving slightly over 30 days of medical therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r34">[34]</xref>&#x000a0;Serial imaging should be used to monitor and confirm the complete resolution of the abscess.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>The emergence of more resistant organisms, such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteria and methicillin-resistant <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, has greatly complicated treatment as up to 75% of organisms causing prostatic abscess infections are resistant to first-generation antibiotics. This requires the use of intravenous carbapenem, third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam, amikacin, or various combinations while awaiting blood and urine culture results, especially in patients who present with febrile urinary tract infections or sepsis after prostatic biopsies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;Oral fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can be used later and in afebrile patients, if cultures confirm bacterial sensitivity. Repeat cultures after one week of treatment are recommended. Traditional therapy has required four weeks of continuous antibiotic therapy, but some studies have shown that two weeks may be sufficient, at least in some cases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r35">[35]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>There is some controversy regarding urethral catheter drainage vs. a suprapubic tube. Urethral drainage with a Foley or intermittent catheterization can induce more prostatic manipulation, be uncomfortable or painful to the patient, and become infected. The standard recommendation for patients with poor bladder emptying is to use a suprapubic tube to avoid further irritation and manipulation of a swollen and infected prostate.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>About 80% of patients will ultimately require early surgical drainage based on their overall condition or the size of the abscess.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r7">[7]</xref> Different approaches have been described for ultrasound-guided abscess drainage, namely transrectal drainage, transurethral unroofing, resection, or aspiration, and transperineal evacuation of the abscess.&#x000a0;Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages. After a single aspiration, the reported recurrence rate ranges from 15 to 33%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;About one-third of patients will eventually require transurethral prostate resection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>In the past, transurethral drainage (unroofing or resection) was the most commonly selected therapy due to its reduced length of hospital stay. It is also the procedure of choice for larger abscesses and in those cases where aspiration alone has been inadequate. However, some experts are concerned about possible complications such as post-operative voiding dysfunction. Transurethral resection can also overlook or miss small prostatic abscesses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r30">[30]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r34">[34]</xref>&#x000a0;Transurethral drainage of a prostatic abscess can be accomplished using a holmium laser. This has the advantage of minimizing manipulation of the infected tissue and can safely be used in anti-coagulated patients as well as those with untreated coagulopathies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r36">[36]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r37">[37]</xref>&#x000a0;Another approach that has been used successfully involves endoscopic transrectal ultrasound-guided drainage, which may be appropriate for selected individuals, especially when the abscess is larger and close to the rectum. For some reason, a transurethral procedure cannot be done or is otherwise inadvisable.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r38">[38]</xref></p>
        <p>As the abscess is not always visible cystoscopically, clinicians should be prepared to perform an extensive transurethral resection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r39">[39]</xref> Transient bacteremia is not uncommon after transurethral prostate resection, but limited unroofing rarely progresses to septicemia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r16">[16]</xref> Massage of the prostate after transurethral unroofing to more completely clean out and drain the abscess cavity has been recommended by some, but this entails significant additional manipulation of an infected organ with the potential for disseminating the infection. Therefore, this should only be done after carefully considering the benefits and potential risks.</p>
        <p>Currently,&#x000a0;transrectal drainage with&#x000a0;transrectal ultrasound guidance is the first choice approach, especially for smaller abscesses less than 2 cm in diameter, because it is done using only local anesthesia, has a low risk of complications, and is easily repeatable if necessary.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r40">[40]</xref>&#x000a0;An 18 gauge or larger bore needle should be used as abscess contents can be particularly thick and heavy, making aspiration difficult with smaller instruments. A specimen should be sent for culture even if previous cultures were performed. Irrigation through the needle may also be needed to lower the viscosity of the purulent material and permit aspiration. Aspiration and irrigation should be repeated and continued until clear, if possible. While a single aspiration is usually sufficient for most cases, a repeat procedure should be considered if the patient fails to improve, and imaging suggests another treatment would be helpful. If there is a lack of improvement after two aspirations, consideration should be given to an alternate drainage procedure, usually a transurethral resection or unroofing.</p>
        <p>The transcutaneous perineal route of aspiration is also an option at times, and CT guidance can be used. MRI-transrectal ultrasound fusion-guided aspiration is also possible utilizing the same technology currently used for targeted prostatic biopsies. Transurethral resection is recommended for larger abscesses and patients who have failed transrectal ultrasound-guided aspirations. Open surgical drainage may be necessary if the abscess has spread to deeper&#x000a0;tissue, such as the levator ani muscle, but should be avoided whenever possible due to prolonged wound healing, possible fistula formation, and the potential development of superinfections.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r41">[41]</xref></p>

        <p>The prognosis of patients with a prostate abscess mainly depends on a timely diagnosis and proper treatment as well as their prior general health and comorbidities. Early recognition of this disorder with timely and appropriate treatment modalities dramatically improves the prognosis. Conservatively treated patients may avoid a surgical procedure but will typically need a longer duration of antibiotic therapy.

        <p>In the modern era, a prostate abscess cannot just be assumed to be a consequence of untreated prostatitis. Men with prostatic abscesses generally have significant medical problems and are often severely debilitated or immunologically compromised. A prostatic abscess can be the initial presentation of a previously undiagnosed immune compromising condition in the younger population. It is becoming more common in older men as a complication of benign prostatic hyperplasia or a prostate biopsy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;Due to the challenges in differentiating prostate abscess in patients with acute bacterial prostatitis and the importance of long-term adherence to the recommended antibiotic treatments, it is crucial for patients to be aware of the seriousness of this pathology and for physicians to carry a high index of suspicion to obtain a prompt diagnosis and initiate timely treatment.</p>
        <p>Male patients with lower urinary tract infections and prostate infections should be educated to monitor for warning signs and symptoms of abscess formation. In particular, patients who develop febrile urinary tract infections following a prostate biopsy should be considered high risk for developing a prostatic abscess and should be educated accordingly. With the blossoming of more resistant bacterial strains and the relatively frequent presentation of this condition in diabetic and immunosuppressed patients, real-life scenarios present increasing challenges in the diagnosis and management of these patients.&#x000a0;</p>

        <p>Prostatic abscesses are often underdiagnosed because symptoms can&#x000a0;overlap with several other urinary tract diseases. Due to the need for subspeciality evaluation and management, primary care providers and hospitalists should coordinate with surgical services and the urology team to improve outcomes. Interprofessional team communication and care coordination between endocrinologists for underlying diabetes management, infectious diseases, and ancillary&#x000a0;services like nutrition and the wound care team play a significant role in improving the prognosis and reducing complications. The treating clinician can also enlist the assistance of a board-certified infectious disease specialist or pharmacist, who can collaborate on agent selection, provide the latest antibiogram data, verify dosing, and perform medication reconciliation. The pharmacist or infectious disease specialist should educate the patient on antibiotic compliance. Also, it is vital that the primary clinicians adequately control the blood glucose, counsel the patient on safe sex practices, and when to seek further treatment. These educational processes can benefit from nursing staff who will not only provide training and answer questions but can perform follow-up monitoring, evaluate treatment effectiveness, and inform the physician of any concerns.</p>
        <p>Open communication between the team is vital to minimize morbidity and mortality. Patients with prostate abscesses must be monitored closely, as they may experience a high mortality rate if proper and timely treatment is delayed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27832.r26">[26]</xref>&#x000a0;This is why interprofessional teamwork is necessary to achieve optimal outcomes for the patient.
