        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>The measurement of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) was first developed in the early 1900s; however, it was complex and of limited clinical use.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18846.r1">[1]</xref> On the most basic level, end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (ETCO<sub>2</sub>) detectors measure the exhaled concentration of carbon dioxide. The concentration of exhaled CO<sub>2&#x000a0;</sub>correlates to the arterial concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>, although multiple factors can impact the relationship. Technological advances have allowed CO<sub>2</sub> to become a common measurement in healthcare with many clinical applications.</p>
        <p>Although CO<sub>2</sub> detectors ultimately measure exhaled CO<sub>2</sub>, some units have design differences.&#x000a0;Detectors can be divided into quantitative and qualitative types. Qualitative detectors demonstrate the presence or absence of CO<sub>2</sub>. The most basic unit of this type is the colorimetric detector, producing a color change as the gas flows through a litmus paper film in the airway circuit. Qualitative&#x000a0;detectors are primarily used to initially confirm the proper placement of an endotracheal tube by demonstrating the presence (connoting&#x000a0;successful placement in the trachea) or lack (esophageal placement) of exhaled CO<sub>2</sub>. These detectors&#x000a0;are usually elementary, light, and portable devices that do not require power. Quantitative detectors measure the level of CO<sub>2</sub> that is exhaled and, therefore, provide more detailed information. Qualitative detection can be further subdivided into capnography and capnometry. Capnography produces a waveform in a graphic format, while capnometry provides a numeric display of the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration.&#x000a0;Waveform capnography provides more information to the clinician.&#x000a0;Alterations of the waveform morphology can be interpreted to give clues to the clinical situation.</p>
        <p>Their location in the airway circuit is also used to categorize detectors. These are typically divided into mainstream and sidestream devices. Mainstream detectors utilize an IR sensor positioned directly within the gas flow path and produce real-time graphs of the CO<sub>2</sub> waveform. These tend to be more&#x000a0;costly units used primarily for intubated patients. Sidestream detectors are located off the main path of flow in the airway circuit. Sidestream detectors often use small-diameter tubing leading to a detector that allows gas sampling. Nasal monitoring of end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> typically makes use of this configuration.</p>
        <p>There are some pitfalls and considerations when using CO<sub>2</sub> detectors. Fluids such as vomitus, frothy secretions from a patient experiencing acute pulmonary edema, sputum from pneumonia, or moisture can render CO<sub>2</sub> detectors ineffective. The detector paper in colorimetric units is particularly sensitive to fluids. Mainstream detectors are located directly in the path of the airway circuit and, therefore, increase the volume of undesirable dead space. On the other hand, Sidestream detectors may experience a delay compared to mainstream detectors because of the remote location of the sensor.</p>

</p>
        <p>The graph demonstrates a typical CO<sub>2</sub> waveform that might be seen from a mainstream capnograph (see <bold>Graph.</bold> CO<sub>2</sub> Waveform).&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Phase A</italic> represents the first exhalation step as gas from the dead space arrives at the detector. This dead space gas contains no CO<sub>2</sub> introduced from the lungs and, therefore, is seen as a flat, zero concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> over time.&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Phase B</italic> demonstrates the rapid rise in CO<sub>2</sub> as the expiratory phase continues and the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> rises. This phase reflects a mixing of the dead space gas, which lacks CO<sub>2</sub>, and the alveolar gas.&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Phase C</italic> represents the alveolar plateau phase, where the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> becomes more constant over time. The rate of rise of this phase can change in certain pathological states, for example, with bronchospasm, where the rise is steeper.&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Point D</italic> represents the &#x0201c;end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>&#x0201d; level; this is the highest concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> during the cycle and occurs at the end of expiration.&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Phase E</italic> shows the rapid decline in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration that begins with inspiration as external gas enters the lungs. This external gas has a low concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>, and the waveform returns to baseline.</p>
        <p>Alterations to this typical waveform can be used as clues that alert the clinician to changes in the status of their patient. Hyperventilation typically produces a pattern of increased respiratory frequency associated with a depressed waveform. Hypoventilation is known to occur in at least 2 common types. A decreased respiratory rate causes Bradypnea hypoventilation and produces a waveform pattern with low respiratory frequency and elevated ETCO<sub>2</sub>. Hypopneic hypoventilation, in contrast, reveals a decreased ETCO<sub>2</sub> caused by the patient taking shallower breaths than normal. Although these are both forms of hypoventilation,&#x000a0;1 results in an elevation of ETCO<sub>2</sub>, and the other causes a decrease in ETCO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

        <p>
<bold>Procedural Sedation and Analgesia </bold>
</p>
        <p>Continuous end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring during the performance of procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA), sometimes called &#x0201c;conscious sedation,&#x0201d; is often recommended as a measure to detect respiratory depression. The medications associated with PSA, such as proposal, benzodiazepines, and narcotics, can often lead to respiratory depression. It is essential to recognize that the levels of sedation represent a continuum of drug effects.&#x000a0;The lightest forms of sedation include mild anxiolysis, where a patient can generally respond after receiving these medications. At the other extreme is deep sedation or general anesthesia, where the patient requires active respiratory support and may require&#x000a0;hemodynamic support during the procedure. PSA is intended to preserve a patient&#x02019;s basic cardiopulmonary functioning; however, the medications used in PSA can have side effects, including hypotension, loss of protective airway reflexes, and hypoventilation. Respiratory depression is considered to be&#x000a0;1 of the most significant risks during the administration of PSA. To address the risk of hypoventilation, many experts who study and provide PSA have explored whether CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring can help identify hypoventilation and improve patient safety. Oxygen saturation has classically been used as the marker for hypoventilation. However, this&#x000a0;may be a late marker of hypoventilation, particularly when supplemental oxygen is administered prophylactically during the administration of PSA.</p>
        <p>Some specialty societies whose members perform PSA have recommendations about CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18846.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;The American Society for Anesthesia promotes stronger recommendations about CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring during moderate and deep sedation while others have less proscriptive&#x000a0;suggestions about its use.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18846.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18846.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18846.r3">[3]</xref> Adoption of the practice of regular CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring during PSA has been less rapid for those providers outside of the operating room due to limitations in evidence to support objective benefits and the lack of available equipment and training.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18846.r5">[5]</xref> Furthermore, the clinical relevance is still being evaluated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18846.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;Other groups, such as a recent Cochrane review, have argued that the current evidence is not able to demonstrate a difference in outcomes when using CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring in addition to standard monitoring.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18846.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Endotracheal Tube Confirmation and Monitoring </bold>
</p>
        <p>CO<sub>2</sub> detection has grown to be used as an important indicator to confirm the correct placement of an endotracheal tube (ETT) after intubation. Airway experts widely recommend this as a required step in ETT confirmation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18846.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Capnography has been shown to be a highly reliable method of endotracheal tube confirmation. A properly positioned tube in the trachea produces a reliable CO<sub>2</sub> waveform that can be detected reliably by these sensors. Esophageal intubation&#x000a0;does not transmit CO<sub>2</sub> to the detector and would indicate improper placement. Hypopharyngeal intubation is a special circumstance when the endotracheal tube is not positioned through the vocal cords, but rather just superior to the glottis. Hypopharyngeal intubations can be difficult to identify clinically, and capnography may assist in detecting this situation through an abnormal or inconsistent waveform. Additional methods of confirming tube position include direct visualization of the glottis, auscultation for breath sounds and inspection for chest rise during ventilation.</p>
        <p>A false negative CO<sub>2</sub> reading may occur in cases of cardiac arrest when there is no cardiopulmonary circulation to carry CO<sub>2</sub> to the alveoli and, ultimately, to the detector. In this case, it is possible that an endotracheal tube could be properly positioned in the trachea yet not provide&#x000a0;a CO<sub>2</sub> waveform. However, the detector does not produce a waveform with ventilation and could lead to the wrong conclusion. Early initiation of CPR during cardiac arrest leads to circulatory flow which can then generate aO<sub>2</sub>2 waveform, helping confirm proper tube position. In the later phases of resuscitation as cell death occurs, even with CPR being performed, the CO<sub>2</sub> levels fall.</p>
        <p>Continuous CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring of an intubated patient can also help identify accidental endotracheal tube displaced during transport or movement of a patient. Continuous monitoring can also help detect other post-intubation complications such as airway obstruction from a kinked ETT or mucous plugging. Anytime a waveform is suddenly lost, it should alert the clinician to evaluate the equipment and connections and determine if there is a more concerning cause for the loss.</p>

<bold>Effectiveness of CPR</bold>
</italic>
</p>
        <p>Immediately after a cardiac arrest and during CPR, chest compressions generate cardiac output that results in circulatory flow and the generation of a CO2 waveform. In cardiac arrest without compressions, there may be no detectable CO<sub>2</sub> level. End-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> levels correlate with the effectiveness of the compressions and can be used to help guide resuscitation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18846.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;High-quality CPR produces higher cardiac output and, therefore, higher CO<sub>2</sub> levels than poor-quality CPR.&#x000a0; This information can guide the resuscitation. Important factors that lead to high-quality CPR include rate, depth, recoil and the lack of interruptions. These factors should be assessed when there is a low CO2 level during the resuscitation of a patient with cardiac arrest. Compressor fatigue can lead to loss of quality compressions and can be detected by a decline in end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> levels. Cardiac arrest teams can give feedback to the compressor about their technique, or they may choose alternate to a &#x0201c;fresh&#x0201d; compressors based on these levels. The American Heart Association 2010 recommendations suggest that an ETCO<sub>2</sub> level of less than 10 mm Hg during CPR would be a reasonable indication to aim efforts toward improving the quality of compressions.</p>
        <p>
<italic toggle="yes">
<bold>Return of Spontaneous Circulation</bold>
</italic>
</p>
        <p>During cardiac arrest, when there is a triumphant return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), there is an associated rise in end-tidal CO2 levels; this is often the first sign of ROSC.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18846.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;A sudden rise in CO2 may alert the cardiac arrest team that there is ROSC and trigger an assessment of circulatory status through pulse, rhythm, and blood pressure. The clinical relevance is to avoid unnecessary interruptions in CPR. A rise in CO<sub>2</sub> may be an earlier sign of ROSC than performing frequent pulse checks that cause a pause in compressions.</p>
        <p>
<italic toggle="yes">
<bold>Termination of Resuscitation</bold>
</italic>
</p>
        <p>End-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> is also helpful during resuscitation to help predict death after a prolonged cardiac arrest. After 20 minutes of CPR, an end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> level of 19 mm Hg or less is predictive of death as an outcome of the cardiac arrest.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18846.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;It can be challenging to make the clinical decision when to terminate resuscitative efforts when caring for a patient experiencing cardiac arrest. ETCO<sub>2</sub> levels provide additional data to the clinician to help make this decision.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18846.r12">[12]</xref></p>
        <p>
<italic toggle="yes">
<bold>Future and Growing Applications</bold>
</italic>
</p>
        <p>ETCO<sub>2</sub> approximates the arterial concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> (PaCO<sub>2</sub>).&#x000a0; It is typically 2 to 5 mm Hg lower and can be used to estimate the effectiveness of ventilation. This gap can be affected by multiple disease states such as asthma, COPD, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism among others that cause a change in V/Q mismatching, alteration of physiological dead space or shunt physiology. CO<sub>2</sub> detection provides a window into ventilation, pulmonary perfusion, and cardiac output.&#x000a0; Multiple disease states are being studied in attempts to find clinical correlations to CO<sub>2</sub> levels. Recent work has explored various possible uses, including determination of metabolic rate, diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, and assessment for diabetic ketoacidosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18846.r13">[13]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18846.r14">[14]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18846.r15">[15]</xref>&#x000a0;As equipment becomes more available, novel uses of capnography are being studied and the relationship between end-tidal carbon dioxide and CPR quality during both in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.</p>
