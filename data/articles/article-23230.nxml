        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>Throughout pregnancy, multiple physiologic changes contribute to fluctuating levels of thyroid hormones. Due to increased circulating estrogens, pregnancy brings a 50% increase in thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), which binds circulating T4, causing a decrease in free T4 levels. To compensate, the thyroid grows in size and increases the production of T4 and T3 by 50%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;Due to&#x000a0;TSH's homology with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), rising hCG levels in the first trimester lead to stimulation of the thyroid, in turn causing a further elevation in free T4.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;The hCG levels peak between 8 to 12 weeks of gestation and gradually decrease thereafter.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r10">[10]</xref></p>
        <p>Conversely, the developing placenta contains deiodinase type 3 (DIO3), which deactivates T4 and T3. Excessive function by this enzyme can lead to hypothyroidism. Typically, this effect is outweighed by increased hCG production in early pregnancy, leading to a net increase in free T4 with a decreased median TSH and reference range.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;This transient increase in free T4 usually resolves by mid-pregnancy as hCG levels plateau and decline.</p>
        <p>There is also an increased dietary iodine requirement, from 150 micrograms to 250 micrograms daily, due to increased thyroid hormone synthesis during pregnancy. There is also an appreciable loss of iodine in urine due to the increased glomerular filtration rate in pregnancy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <p>Grave disease involves&#x000a0;TRAbs that bind the TSH receptor and impact the production of thyroid hormones. These antibodies can be stimulatory or inhibitory. In Grave disease, the net effect of TRAbs is stimulatory, causing a pathologic increase in free T4 that usually requires medical management.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <p>Pregnancy results in a period of immunosuppression to avoid rejection of the developing fetus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r2">[2]</xref> Antibody titers, including TRAbs, decrease as the pregnancy progresses, especially in the second and third trimesters. In the postpartum period, the immune system returns to the pre-pregnancy state, and antibody titers increase. This increases the risk of relapse in Grave disease or another condition known as postpartum thyroiditis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r9">[9]</xref></p>

        <p>Identifying a history of Grave disease is important even if surgery or radioiodine ablation was performed, since TRAbs may persist and cause fetal hyperthyroidism.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r10">[10]</xref></p>

        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>When new-onset hyperthyroidism is suspected in pregnancy, laboratory evaluation is similar to the non-gravid patient.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r8">[8]</xref> Evaluation starts with a TSH level, which is often decreased in pregnancy due to the stimulation of the thyroid by hCG, causing negative feedback on TSH production. If the TSH level is lower than the reference range, thyroid hormone levels should be checked to help differentiate overt hyperthyroidism from normal physiologic changes in pregnancy. Most commonly, free T4 levels are evaluated. Total levels of T4 and T3, free T4 index, or TBG may be clinically useful if available.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r10">[10]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r11">[11]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r12">[12]</xref></p>
        <p>The interpretation of these laboratory studies is different in the pregnant patient, as the normal values vary between trimesters and the non-gravid state due to increasing levels of TBG.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r10">[10]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;Reference ranges for TSH are trimester-specific. TSH ranges from 0.1 to 2.5 mIU/L, 0.2 to 3.0 mIU/L, and 0.3 to 3.5 mIU/L in the first, second, and third trimesters, respectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r6">[6]</xref> If non-pregnant reference ranges are applied in error, misclassification of thyroid status can occur.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r6">[6]</xref> Free T4 reference ranges need to be established by individual laboratories.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r12">[12]</xref></p>
        <p>A definitive diagnosis of hyperthyroidism may be difficult due to normally fluctuating levels of thyroid hormone in pregnancy.

        <p>Hyperthyroidism in pregnancy is treated with medications that inhibit excessive thyroid hormone synthesis. The antithyroid drugs (ATD) most commonly used in the U.S. are thioamides, propylthiouracil (PTU), and methimazole (MMI). Carbimazole is a prodrug of methimazole that is commonly used outside of North America, with similar efficacy and side effect profile.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r12">[12]</xref> All ATDs can cross the placenta and affect the fetus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>Historically, PTU was commonly used for hyperthyroidism in all patients. However, it is associated with hepatoxicity that can lead to liver failure and subsequent need for transplantation. Therefore, methimazole is more commonly used now if tolerated. An exception to this is during early pregnancy due to methimazole and carbimazole's association with a rare embryopathy, which includes aplasia cutis, abdominal wall defects, esophageal atresia, choanal atresia, eye abnormalities, urinary tract abnormalities, and circulatory defects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r11">[11]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;After the first trimester, when the majority of organogenesis is complete, patients are then transitioned to methimazole.

However, ATDs can overcorrect fetal hyperthyroidism even if the mother is euthyroid, causing fetal hypothyroidism. Thus, the goal of treatment is to use the lowest dose of antithyroid medication possible, with a TSH target slightly lower than the reference range and a maternal free T4 at the high-end of normal.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r10">[10]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r11">[11]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;If the TSH becomes normal, it likely means that the fetus is receiving too much ATD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r8">[8]</xref></p>

<bold>Thyroid Storm </bold>

        <p>A thyroid storm is a life-threatening complication that can occur when hyperthyroidism is uncontrolled and is a manifestation of the most decompensated state of disease. In addition to uncontrolled hyperthyroidism, there is usually a precipitating event before a thyroid storm. These events can include labor, cesarean section, preeclampsia, trauma, or an infection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Patients may present with severe tachycardia, tachyarrhythmias, mental status changes, heat intolerance, fever, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, congestive heart failure, and multi-organ failure. In addition to antithyroid drugs, thyroid storm requires intensive care admission, electrolyte replacement, fluid resuscitation, cooling, and oxygen. PTU or&#x000a0;methimazole can be used to stop thyroid hormone synthesis. At least one hour after ATD therapy, potassium iodide or Lugol solution can be given to block further hormone release from the thyroid. If given before or too soon after ATDs, KI can worsen the thyroid storm. Beta-blockers can be used to improve tachycardia and tachyarrhythmias. High-dose glucocorticoids can also be given to decrease the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. If heart failure is present, digoxin can be used to increase cardiac output. It is also important to address the precipitating event of thyroid storm, such as antibiotics, for an underlying infection. If the patient is febrile, acetaminophen should be used rather than aspirin, since aspirin can increase circulating thyroid hormones.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r8">[8]</xref></p>

        <p>The concept of universal screening for thyroid disease in pregnancy has been a point of controversy. While professional obstetric societies recommend targeted screening for thyroid disease in those who are at high risk for thyroid dysfunction, there are some arguments for universal screening. Thyroid function tests are relatively low cost. If all pregnant women are screened for thyroid disease at the initial prenatal visit, many cases of both overt hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can be diagnosed earlier. This allows for earlier intervention to optimize thyroid hormone levels to decrease maternal and fetal risks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>Without universal screening, all members of the health care team should be aware of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy to know when to screen for thyroid disease. Providers, provider's assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses, and medical assistants should all know how to take a history that includes previously diagnosed thyroid disease, including any thyroid procedures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r12">[12]</xref></p>
        <p>Primary care providers and endocrinologists should inquire whether a patient with Grave disease is planning future pregnancies. This allows the patient to optimize their thyroid hormone levels with appropriate medication and to get adequate counseling during the preconception period, as it is recommended to postpone conceptions until the patient is euthyroid and stable.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;Any changes to an antithyroid medication regimen should be made by&#x000a0;five weeks gestation to minimize exposure to inappropriate medication and to optimize thyroid hormone levels early in the pregnancy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r11">[11]</xref></p>
        <p>Neonatology should be made aware of following neonates born to women with Grave disease for signs and symptoms of transient hyperthyroidism or neonatal Grave disease due to TRAbs that crossed the placenta before birth.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23230.r10">[10]</xref></p>
