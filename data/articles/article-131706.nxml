        <p>With over 1.4 billion adults worldwide categorized as overweight or obese and an increase in obesity-related health conditions, a need for effective treatment and management modalities is crucial. Intragastric balloons serve as a minimally invasive tool to combat the obesity pandemic. There are multiple intragastric balloons approved for the United States and European markets. Indications in the USA include a BMI of 30 to 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> but a BMI of 27 to 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in Europe. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and pathophysiology of intragastric balloons and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Since the beginning of the 1980s, the worldwide prevalence of obesity has doubled. An estimated&#x000a0;1 in&#x000a0;3 adults is categorized as overweight or obese, equating to greater than 1.4 billion adults. Given the epidemic rates of obesity and the subsequent rise in the prevalence of obesity-related health conditions and comorbidities, there is a global need for effective and safe treatment of this disease. Comorbidities include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, orthopedic conditions, gastroesophageal reflux disease, metabolic dysfunction, psychiatric disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and cancers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>While bariatric surgery is considered the most effective treatment modality for morbid obesity, there are restrictions for a patient to be a candidate for surgical intervention. Bariatric surgeries, which range from Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, duodenal switch, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, to name a few, require a body mass index (BMI) greater than 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> with associated comorbidities or meeting the BMI criteria for severe obesity with a BMI greater than 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;With the parameters mentioned above&#x000a0;to meet preoperative criteria, this leaves an intermediate group of patients who are not candidates for surgery but have also failed or not responded well to medical therapies. These patients are also looking for a safe and effective weight-loss therapy that is minimally invasive, like the intragastric balloon. Current treatment modalities for obese patients include lifestyle modifications, pharmacotherapy, bariatric surgery, and endoscopic applications, of which the intragastric balloon is the most widely used.</p>
        <p>Intragastric balloon therapies are a minimally invasive and temporary methodology to induce weight loss in obese patients. The soft saline or an air-filled balloon is placed into the stomach, typically in an endoscopic fashion. The balloon is a restrictive mechanism and promotes the feeling of satiation as it is a space-occupying device. The average gastric capacity is approximately 1200 mL, but an obese patient can stretch this volume threefold. A balloon volume of 400 mL or higher is enough to induce the feeling of satiation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;A proposed mechanism of action is the delayed gastric emptying process, which can serve as a contributing weight-loss factor. Importantly, as with all bariatric procedures, a patient must comply with lifestyle modifications to achieve and maintain meaningful weight loss before and after any intervention.</p>
        <p>
<bold>History</bold>
</p>
        <p>The study of intragastric restriction dates back to 1939, with the investigation of gastric bezoars by Michael DeBakey. His analysis concluded that approximately 30% of patients with gastric bezoars and concretions had experienced weight loss.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Patients analyzed suffered from gastrointestinal symptoms, most commonly nausea and vomiting, and did not necessarily lose weight. The first intragastric balloon introduced in 1985 was created by husband-and-wife gastroenterologists Lloyd Garren and Mary Garren. This balloon was introduced in the United States and was called the Garren-Edwards Gastric Bubble (GEGB). The GEGB was a cylindrical, &#x0201c;tin can&#x0201d; shape with a central, hollow channel for insertion and retrieval in an endoscopic fashion. This balloon was filled with approximately 200 mL of room air and placed in the stomach for&#x000a0;4 months. This intragastric balloon received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but was withdrawn from the market in 1992 due to severe side effects.&#x000a0;Complications included gastric ulcers, Mallory-Weiss tears, small bowel obstructions, and gastric erosion. There was also insufficient efficacy in weight loss with patients using these devices.</p>
        <p>The failures of the GEGB promoted the 1987 conference titled Obesity and the Gastric Balloon: A Comprehensive Workshop. This obesity congress included 75 international experts from gastroenterology, surgery, nutrition, behavioral medicine, and obesity specialists.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;This meeting aimed to develop a consensus on the technology of intragastric balloons and treatment options. The ideal balloon characteristics should include high efficacy, radiopaque markers, adjustability to a variety of sizes between 400 and 500 mL, low ulcer and obstructive potential, absence of edges or sharp ridges, the composition of materials that last for long periods, made to maximize both weight-loss and limit the amount of food intake. According to this conference, the usage of intragastric balloon therapy was for patients whose BMI did not qualify for operative bariatric procedures but desired to improve an obesity-associated condition or to lose excess weight. The intragastric balloons could also be utilized for patients with an extremely high BMI who are either unfit for bariatric surgery or to reduce body weight before bariatric surgery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Using the characteristics and conclusions from the Obesity and the Gastric Balloon conference, a balloon was developed in 1991 by the BioEnterics Corporation.&#x000a0;This balloon contained a saline and methylene blue mixture and would remain in the stomach for 6 months. Initially, this balloon was used outside North America in Asia, South America, Europe, and the Middle East. The balloon, called Orbera, eventually received FDA approval in the&#x000a0;United States&#x000a0;in 2015.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;Since 2015, different intragastric balloon systems have been introduced to the&#x000a0;United States and European markets. The usage of these balloons ranges from primary weight loss, a bridging therapy for bariatric surgery, and a weight-loss solution for high-risk patients. Attracting factors to intragastric balloons include the little to noninvasive nature, limited to a specific time frame, and reversible. The intragastric balloon also preserves the anatomy of the stomach. It is important to note that weight loss is not comparable to that expected from a surgical procedure. Intragastric balloons can be used as a weight-loss tool but are ineffective for weight maintenance. The advantages and disadvantages must be analyzed individually when making a medical therapy decision with a patient.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r7">[7]</xref></p>

<bold>Anatomy</bold>
</p>
        <p>The stomach is an intraperitoneal digestive organ between the esophagus and the first portion of the small intestine, called the duodenum.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;The stomach primarily lies within the epigastric and umbilical regions of the abdomen. There are&#x000a0;4 main anatomical divisions within the stomach. The first is the cardia, which surrounds the superior opening of the stomach at the thoracic level 11. The next division is the fundus, a rounded and often gas-filled portion of the stomach that is both superior and left of the cardia. The large, central portion of the stomach inferior to the fundus is known as the body. The&#x000a0;4 division is the pylorus. The pylorus connects the stomach to the duodenum, with subdivisions into the antrum, canal, and pyloric sphincter. The pyloric sphincter serves as a demarcation of the transpyloric plane at lumbar vertebrae level 1.</p>
        <p>The stomach has a greater and lesser curvature. The greater curvature is the long and convex curvature on the lateral border of the stomach. It curves towards the right as it courses mediately to the antrum. It is vascularly supplied by the short gastric arteries and the right and left gastro-omental arteries. The right gastro-omental artery is a terminal gastroduodenal artery branch arising off the common hepatic artery.&#x000a0;The left gastro-omental artery is a branch of the splenic artery derived from the celiac trunk. The lesser curvature of the stomach is shorter and concave and located on the medial surface of the stomach. The angular notch indicates the junction of the body and the pyloric region of the stomach and is the most inferior part of the lesser curvature. The lesser curvature provides attachments to the hepatogastric ligament. The vascular supply to the lesser curvature is the hepatic artery's left gastric artery and right gastric branch. The right gastric artery comes off the common hepatic artery, derived from the celiac trunk. The left gastric artery directly comes off of the celiac trunk.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;There are&#x000a0;2 sphincters of importance when relating to gastric emptying located at each orifice of the stomach: the inferior esophageal sphincter and the pyloric sphincter.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Pathophysiology</bold>
</p>
        <p>The insertion of an intragastric balloon promotes the feeling of satiation and uses restriction as a mechanism for weight loss. The balloon reduces the stomach's capacity to accommodate food, reducing caloric intake. The intragastric balloon typically occupies up to&#x000a0;a third of the stomach cavity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;Since the intragastric balloon mechanism relies on a restrictive process, the efficacy depends on patient adherence to diet and exercise modifications. A complex neuro-humoral axis that regulates the feeling of satiation and body weight exists within the gut-brain axis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>There are nervous and humoral afferent cells from the gastrointestinal tract and adipose tissue integrated within the brain stem circuitry. Signals for hunger, saturation, and satiation are provided within complex brainstem circuits. Mechanical stimuli like stomach distention feed the system but are modulated via hormonal and psychological factors like the reward system. After ingesting food, the stomach undergoes distention and signals saturation via the parasympathetic afferent fibers. By contrast, the brainstem nuclei control the pre-prandial tone and relaxation post-meal. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated a difference between physiological distention via nutrients versus intragastric balloon distention of the stomach. The inflated balloon's mechanic distention addresses the brain region in which pain processing occurs. This pain processing is part of a visceral pain neuromatrix that is downregulated with the infusion of nutrients. This processing may be part of a physiological process for the body to ensure an adequate food intake despite experiencing gastric distention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The processing likely explains the side effects in the first days following the placement of an intragastric balloon and satiety after food ingestion. Functional MRI studies have demonstrated that sweet liquid beverages did not significantly affect the cortical brain circuits associated with a food craving, meaning that a patient who has an increased intake of liquid calories may not have many benefits from the placement of an intragastric balloon system.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r10">[10]</xref></p>
        <p>Regarding the hormonal effects on satiation and hunger, ghrelin is a hormone of discussion. Ghrelin is a 28 amino acid sequence peptide, primarily expressed in the gastric fundus and key in weight regulation.&#x000a0;Ghrelin stimulates appetite and feeding behavior, energy homeostasis, and carbohydrate metabolism. This hormone stimulates the release of growth hormone from the pituitary gland. The orexigenic effects of ghrelin are secondary to the binding of the hormone to the growth hormone secretagogue receptors. Ghrelin promotes both adipose depositions and lipogenesis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;It stimulates appetite and food intake by acting upon the hypothalamic gland at the arcuate nucleus. It inhibits insulin secretion and causes an increase in plasma glucose levels. It also stimulates both gastric and intestinal motility. The role of the intragastric balloon with ghrelin is unclear. Research has shown that calorie intake may be a required signal for the secretion of ghrelin, and the mechanical effects of the balloon's inflation alone did not show a reduction in the plasma levels of ghrelin.</p>
        <p>Besides the restrictive process of the balloon and the hormonal factors, gastric emptying is another mechanism for weight loss post intragastric balloon insertion. Scintigraphic gastric emptying time post-balloon placement at the three-month mark demonstrated a significant slowing of both solids and liquids in terms of gastric emptying time, positively correlated with weight loss.&#x000a0;There is the question of whether the initial effects of the intragastric balloon persist during the entire treatment period. Subjective ratings of food desires and hunger decrease shortly after the balloon's initial placement, but these alterations disappear at the 2-month post-placement.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r13">[13]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The proposed slowing of gastric emptying is likely seen with saline or fluid-filled balloons. Once filled with fluid, the balloon sinks to the bottom, the distal portion of the stomach, resulting in a longer period of food and liquids emptying within the stomach. An increased length of gastric emptying leads to an increase in the length of satiation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r14">[14]</xref>&#x000a0;Overall, the proposed mechanisms for weight loss during the intragastric balloon treatment timeframe are likely secondary to gastric distention via the restrictive process, hormonal signaling via ghrelin, and the slowed gastric emptying time.</p>

      <sec id="article-131706.s4" sec-type="Indications">
        <title>Indications</title>
        <p>The first-line treatment and initial management for a patient with obesity are lifestyle interventions. This would include counseling the patient on nutrition, exercise, sleep, stress, and developing health goals. When considering a patient for an intragastric balloon, the BMI guidelines differ between Europe and the US. However, in both circumstances, patients must have attempted previous weight loss and management with diet and exercise. In Europe, a patient with a BMI of 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup> is the threshold, but in the US, it is a BMI of 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r15">[15]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>In Europe, a patient with a BMI of 27 to 35 kg/m<sup>2,</sup> or in the&#x000a0;United States with a BMI of 30 to 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, an intragastric balloon can be considered an early intervention therapy to induce weight loss. These patients do not meet the eligibility criteria to undergo bariatric operations, but early intervention would benefit from preventing or even treating obesity-related illnesses.&#x000a0;If a patient has a BMI of 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> with&#x000a0;1 or more of the aforementioned obesity-related medical conditions or a BMI greater than 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, bariatric surgical intervention would be the treatment of choice. Approximately 1 to 2% of these patients who meet these criteria undergo surgical intervention, given the risks associated with surgery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r16">[16]</xref>&#x000a0;In this circumstance, although the patients are eligible for bariatric surgery, alternative interventions to help induce weight loss, like intragastric balloon therapy, can be used. Suppose a patient has a BMI greater than 50 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. In that case, a patient can be considered at high risk for either an anesthesia-related complication or a technical complication during surgical intervention. This is secondary to the large amounts of intra-abdominal fat and hepatomegaly.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r17">[17]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>These patients can be considered for an intragastric balloon as a bridging intervention before a bariatric operation. Having notable preoperative weight loss can decrease the complexity of the surgery and the associated risks with the surgery at hand. Out of the noted criteria for intragastric balloon placement, it is used primarily for those not meeting the BMI criteria for bariatric surgery. When counseling a patient who qualifies for bariatric surgery, this should be encouraged as it has superior weight-loss efficacy and durability compared to lifestyle changes alone. Further research is needed to evaluate the intragastric balloon as a bridging therapy for bariatric operations.</p>

      <sec id="article-131706.s5" sec-type="Contraindications">
        <title>Contraindications</title>
        <p>A complete history and physical examination should be completed so all patients can be screened for contraindications of intragastric balloon placement. The patient's history should focus on any gastrointestinal disorders. Absolute contraindications to an intragastric balloon include any prior gastric surgeries, coagulopathies, severe liver disease, upper gastrointestinal bleeding lesions, pregnancy as well as the desire to become pregnant, alcoholism, drug addiction, and any contraindication for the patient to undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).&#x000a0;Some of the balloons are placed via EGD or swallowing. In circumstances in which balloon retrieval is necessary due to complications, an EGD can be required for this retrieval process. The relative contraindications to intragastric balloon therapy include a large hiatal hernia measuring 3 cm or greater in size, inflammatory bowel disease including ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease, previous abdominal surgeries, esophagitis, chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug usage, and any prior uncontrolled psychiatric disorders.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r18">[18]</xref>&#x000a0;A hiatal hernia larger than 5 cm is considered an absolute contraindication for the Orbera intragastric balloon. Psychiatric disorders should be addressed before balloon placement, as this could equate to problems with compliance.</p>

<bold>Types of Intragastric Balloons</bold>
</p>
        <p>Intragastric balloons vary in terms of the material, duration of therapy, balloon volume, adjustability, and the methodology of insertion and removal. The intragastric balloon placement is typically done within an endoscopy unit as an outpatient procedure. The procedure typically takes roughly 30 minutes, and the patient may be discharged 1 to 2 hours post-placement of the balloon. The&#x000a0;3 FDA-approved balloons include the Obalon, Orbera, and ReShape balloons. These&#x000a0;3 balloons are also approved in Europe, as well as the Elipse, End-Ball, Heliosphere BAG, Lexbal, MedSil, and Spatz3.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;The Orbera balloon was approved for usage in 1997 in Europe and later by the FDA in the&#x000a0;United States&#x000a0;in 2015. This is the balloon system in which most of the data on both safety and efficacy are available. The Orbera balloon is composed of silicone, filled with 400 to 700 mL of saline, and placed endoscopically into the stomach for up to 6 months. The total body weight loss is measured at approximately 10.2%, with excess weight loss at 26.5%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Since 2015, the ReShape system, a dual balloon system, and the Obalon, the first swallowable balloon that allows up to&#x000a0;3 balloons to be inserted without endoscopy, have been introduced. The Obalon system consists of&#x000a0;3 separate balloons. These are inserted by swallowing and then filled with gas nitrogen to approximately 250 mL each by an attached catheter. Typically,&#x000a0;1 balloon is inserted per month with up to&#x000a0;3 balloons. At the 6-month mark post-insertion of the initial balloon, all balloons are retrieved endoscopically. The estimated total body weight loss is measured at 7.1%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;While the Obalon System can be placed without endoscopy, retrieval of the balloon requires endoscopy, which is important to discuss with the patient.</p>
        <p>The ReShape balloon is placed endoscopically for up to 6 months and filled with saline of approximately 750 to 900 mL. It is then retrieved endoscopically at the 6-month mark. The total body weight loss percentage is 6.8%, with an estimated weight loss of 25.1%.&#x000a0;The Spatz3 balloon is unique because it is adjustable and can be in place for up to 12 months. This balloon system can reside in the stomach for up to&#x000a0;1 year. It is placed endoscopically and retrieved in an endoscopic fashion.&#x000a0;It is adjustable and filled with saline. The balloon itself is made of silicone. The total body weight loss is measured at 20.1%, with an estimated weight loss of 45.8%.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The Elipse is the only intragastric balloon that is removed via natural excretion. This does not require any endoscopic procedure. This balloon is noted to be procedure-less and made from polyurethane. It is filled with approximately 550 mL of saline via a&#x000a0;catheter. The balloon is left in situ for up to&#x000a0;4 months. Given the resorbable material inside the balloon, it degrades, which allows a natural release valve to open and empty the balloon. This is then naturally excreted.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r19">[19]</xref>&#x000a0;This balloon may be favorable for patients who want to avoid an endoscopic procedure or undergo anesthesia. After the procedure, the patient may be allowed to have a clear liquid diet approximately&#x000a0;6 hours post-procedure. A liquid diet is typically adhered to until the beginning of the second week, after which a patient can begin a soft food diet. The patient can expect to start consuming a regular diet approximately 3 weeks after the insertion of the balloon if he can tolerate it.</p>

        <p>Before placing an intragastric balloon, a patient should be under the care of a multidisciplinary team, including a nutritionist. The nutritionist helps develop a plan for the patient before the placement of the balloon, in the periprocedural timeframe, and post-balloon removal. Typically, the gastroenterology team sees the patient for 12 months in totality, which includes the&#x000a0;6 months with the balloon in place and&#x000a0;6 months post balloon removal.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r20">[20]</xref>&#x000a0;The patient should have a planned exercise and diet regimen before the balloon's placement and during and after its removal. An experienced endoscopist and staff are key to the balloon's placement. A multidisciplinary team, including a nutritionist, gastroenterologist, primary care clinician, and psychologist/psychiatrist, should see the patient.</p>

        <title>Preparation</title>
        <p>Before placing an intragastric balloon, a patient should be seen in the office to review the procedure and obtain consent. The risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure must be explained. For a patient to be prepared for intragastric balloon placement, there are recommendations that a patient adhere to a clear liquid diet a few days before the procedure to empty the stomach.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r21">[21]</xref>&#x000a0;A proton pump inhibitor should be started before insertion to reduce the amount of stomach acid secretion within the stomach. A nutritionist must evaluate a patient before and throughout treatment until at least&#x000a0;6 months post-balloon removal. The patient is made NPO at midnight the night before the procedure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r22">[22]</xref></p>

        <title>Technique or Treatment</title>
        <p>Intragastric balloon therapy is performed within the endoscopy suite. Light sedation using propofol is often used. General anesthesia can be utilized instead if concerns about airway protection are present. Light sedation is provided to the patient and then prepped for endoscopy. An endoscopic evaluation of the lower distal esophagus and the stomach is performed to ensure the absence of any ulcers or large hiatal hernias.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r23">[23]</xref>&#x000a0;Next, the deflated balloon is slid down the esophagus into the stomach, followed by using the endoscope. Once the balloon is in an appropriate position, the central wire from the balloon is removed. The catheter is connected to a syringe to fill the balloon. The balloon is typically filled 50 mL at a time under endoscopic supervision. The balloon is filled to 500 mL, depending on the balloon type. The filling catheter is detached with the deployment of the balloon. The balloon has a self-sealing valve to prevent leaks.&#x000a0;The catheter is removed with the balloon staying within the stomach cavity. The endoscope should be slid easily around the balloon to ensure that the balloon is not too snug within the stomach or wedged with the potential to cause an outlet obstruction in the stomach. In terms of recovery, the patient spends a few hours after inserting the intragastric balloon in the hospital, where they typically receive IV fluids and anti-emetic medications.</p>
        <p>If the patient tolerates the balloon well, they are discharged the same day. The recommended nutritional guidelines vary, but immediately after the procedure, the patient is on a clear liquid diet, which is advanced to a complete liquid diet that includes protein shakes. The following diet would be a pur&#x000e9;ed diet, which would advance to a soft diet and then to a regular one. The time frames for the advancement of diet are provider-specific, but adequate time&#x000a0;is necessary to allow the stomach to adjust to the intragastric balloon. When discussing the removal of the balloon, a provider can also use a clear liquid diet a couple of days before removing it to ensure emptying of the stomach is adequate. As discussed above, the time when balloon removal occurs depends on which balloon was used.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r24">[24]</xref>&#x000a0;Again, the patient is within the endoscopy suite under light sedation. The balloon is punctured with a needle under direct vision using the endoscope. The balloon is deflated and aspirated or connected to suction to remove the saline or gas. A grasper is used to remove the balloon out through the mouth. A lubricating material such as mineral oil can be used to ease the removal of the balloon through the esophagus.</p>

        <title>Complications</title>
        <p>Given the non-invasive or minimally invasive intragastric balloon procedure, it has gained popularity as a weight-loss procedure. However, adverse events do occur. Patients were analyzed for adverse events in a retrospective analysis that included over 1000 procedures between 2016 and 2017. Approximately 7.2% of these patients had required treatment for dehydration, 2% required readmission, 1.1% needed re-operation, and 6.2% necessitated intervention within the first 30 days.&#x000a0;A study of over 145,000 patients found that intragastric balloon therapy had a higher adverse event rate than laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Specifically, this was due to a significantly higher non-operative re-intervention rate in the intragastric balloon group versus the laparoscopic bariatric surgery group.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r25">[25]</xref></p>
        <p>Gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, dyspepsia, constipation, acid reflux, and burping, are typical symptoms of intragastric balloon therapy. Gastric accommodation to the intragastric balloon is why gastrointestinal symptoms occur.&#x000a0;Approximately 91% of patients have some form of the symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r22">[22]</xref>&#x000a0;Patients have been prescribed medications to aid in controlling these symptoms. A proton pump inhibitor is started before balloon insertion. An anti-emetic medication like ondansetron or aprepitant is often prescribed for as-needed use. During the first week of intragastric balloon therapy, an anticholinergic medication such as scopolamine can be used. Prospective studies have demonstrated that a serotonin receptor antagonist may be effective when combined with midazolam. If a patient experiences persistent symptomatology, the balloon may be removed out of necessity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r26">[26]</xref>&#x000a0;Approximately 4 to 7% of patients have significant gastrointestinal symptoms after the first&#x000a0;7 days of therapy. Less than 3% of these patients require an endoscopic re-intervention or early balloon removal. The safety profile of intragastric balloons is of importance. Serious adverse events from the balloon, including gastric perforation, balloon migration, and mortality, are rare. A meta-analysis of intragastric balloon risks determined that gastric perforation rate is approximately 0.1%, balloon migration 1.4%, and mortality 0.08%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r27">[27]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Adverse events can be associated with the procedure or the balloon itself. Regarding balloon-related adverse events, serious events include gastric or esophageal perforation, gastric ulceration, and balloon migration can occur. These adverse events are primarily unique to the saline, liquid-filled balloons.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r28">[28]</xref>&#x000a0;These include acute pancreatitis as well as spontaneous hyperinflation. The balloon migration or rupture risk is likely secondary to the balloon being in the stomach for an extended period than intended. If the balloon is left in the stomach longer than recommended, this poses a risk for rupture and migration into the small intestine. While most ruptures are excreted successfully, some may cause an intestinal obstruction. These patients should be closely monitored to ensure that the balloon is removed promptly to reduce the risk of migrations and intestinal obstruction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r29">[29]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>A safety precaution to detect rupture is dyeing the saline balloons with a blue dye. The patient may notice their urine turning blue or green as the ruptured dye is absorbed and then excreted renally. The dye serves as a warning mechanism so that the patient is aware of a rupture and can help retrieve it before the balloon migrates and causes a subsequent small bowel obstruction. Multi-balloon therapy can be advantageous for people over&#x000a0;1 with a single balloon. If&#x000a0;1 balloon ruptures, the second balloon may prevent the migration or subsequent obstruction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r30">[30]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r31">[31]</xref>&#x000a0;Another adverse event of concern includes spontaneous hyperinflation. The FDA has received approximately 200 reports worldwide since 2015.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r32">[32]</xref>&#x000a0;Greater than 99% of these cases involve the Orbera balloon therapy.&#x000a0;Hyperinflation involves filling these balloons with an additional amount of either air or liquid once placed in the stomach, which typically necessitates early removal of the device. Another area of concern is that of acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis can develop secondary to any intragastric balloon but has clinically been observed mainly with liquid-filled balloons. The FDA has received almost 30 adverse reports worldwide since 2015, with approximately 2/3 of these events involving the Orbera balloon system.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r33">[33]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The mechanism for acute pancreatitis can be secondary to either direct injury from the balloon or the distended stomach, which exerts pressure on the pancreatic parenchyma. Acute pancreatitis can also develop via an indirect mechanism where a pancreatic injury is secondary through a duodenal obstruction.&#x000a0;Compression of the balloon onto the stomach may compromise blood flow to that region, leading to localized ischemia, ulceration, and eventual perforation. To diagnose this condition or recognize the clinical complications, a provider should look for the recent placement of a gastric balloon, the symptoms consistent with the diagnosis of pancreatitis, and biochemical or radiological evidence supporting pancreatitis. Laboratory work can consist of a lipase level, amylase, complete blood count, renal function test, and liver function tests. An abdominal CT or ultrasound can be used for radiological diagnosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r20">[20]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Adverse events can be secondary to the procedure, primarily during balloon removal. Adverse effects include gastrointestinal bleeding, esophageal tears, esophageal perforation, and pneumonia. Most balloons discussed require endoscopic retrieval and a needle to deflate the ballooning mechanism, sturdy grasper, or snare to remove the balloon. In terms of mortality, the FDA has received reports of 18 deaths worldwide from 2016 to the present in patients with a liquid-filled balloon system used to treat obesity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r34">[34]</xref>&#x000a0;Only&#x000a0;8 of these deaths involved patients in the US,&#x000a0;3 of which used the ReShape balloon and&#x000a0;5 with the Orbera balloon. Of these deaths,&#x000a0;1 occurred due to esophageal perforation,&#x000a0;2 from pulmonary embolism,&#x000a0;3 from gastric perforation, and the remaining&#x000a0;2 from unknown causes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r34">[34]</xref>&#x000a0;To accurately determine mortality, better studies are needed. These 18 deaths reported since 2016 are noted, but the incidence rate of death in those who underwent intragastric balloon therapy is unknown. A systematic review published in 2016 demonstrated a mortality rate of 0.05%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r35">[35]</xref>&#x000a0;More research is necessary for the incidence of death, but the FDA recommends that patients are both instructed and closely monitored for symptoms of life-threatening complications mentioned above. Balloon removal should be performed&#x000a0;promptly&#x000a0;if needed by a highly trained endoscopist.</p>

        <title>Clinical Significance</title>
        <p>The initial weight loss for a patient undergoing an intragastric balloon system can produce a total body weight loss of anywhere from 6 to 15%, compared to 1 to 5% through lifestyle modifications alone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r36">[36]</xref>&#x000a0;In patients whose intragastric balloon therapy was the primary weight-loss agent, with no prior bariatric surgeries noted, the short-term weight reduction at the 6-month mark post-treatment averaged roughly 11.5 kg, but this was more pronounced in patients with&#x000a0;a higher BMI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r34">[34]</xref>&#x000a0;The American Society For Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Bariatric Endoscopy Task Force performed a meta-analysis regarding weight loss via intragastric balloon therapy. The degree of weight loss achieved was dependent upon the balloon system utilized. Two meta-analyses support more significant weight reduction with a liquid-filled balloon than an air-filled balloon.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r27">[27]</xref>&#x000a0;A meta-analysis of 55 studies, including 6645 Orbera implantations, performed by the&#x000a0;American Society For Gastrointestinal Endoscopy demonstrated an estimated total body weight loss of 12.3%, 13.16%, and 11.27% at the&#x000a0;3 months,&#x000a0;6 months, and twelve-month post-implantation mark, respectively.&#x000a0;Three randomized controlled studies demonstrated that the excess weight-loss percentage over the controls was 26.9%, thus meeting the standard for preserving and incorporating valuable endoscopic innovations. The standards are set to approximately 5% of total body weight loss with 15% excess weight loss over the control subjects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r27">[27]</xref></p>
        <p>Intragastric balloons are practical and safe for managing obesity in the short term, but these are temporary measures. Weight regain is expected after removing the balloon, so it is not a mechanism for sustained weight loss. In a study of 500 patients who had&#x000a0;6 months of treatment with balloon therapy, only 50% had maintained 20% excess weight loss at the 1-year mark post-balloon removal, and only 25% maintained this weight loss at the 5-year mark.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r37">[37]</xref>&#x000a0;Notably, there is no difference between lifestyle changes versus balloon therapy at&#x000a0;10 years so that many patients may require additional treatments.&#x000a0;It is important to note that intensive lifestyle intervention programs have a weight loss of approximately 7 to 10 kg after&#x000a0;6 months. Behavioral therapy appears to have long-term weight loss of around 5 kg.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r38">[38]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Long-term follow-up after intragastric balloon placement therapy is heterogenic. Some patients undergo repeated usage of this therapy, others undergo pharmacotherapy, and others may decide on undergoing bariatric surgery. A review of controlled studies of the&#x000a0;3 mentioned FDA balloon systems concluded that all these systems have comparable efficacy on weight loss. The effects of the balloon were greater than those of the control subjects but less than those of bariatric surgery and the weight-loss combination drug phentermine-topiramate. Studies of metabolic parameters with intragastric balloon placement demonstrated improvement in diabetes and hypertension in patients with a &#x000a0;BMI classification of overweight but not obese.&#x000a0;Long-term data evaluating patient outcomes of cardiovascular disease and mortality are not available. Still, it is thought that balloon therapies do not achieve meaningful and sustained improvements in obesity-related comorbidities if used as monotherapy.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Intragastric Balloon Therapy versus Other Weight-loss Therapies</bold>
</p>
        <p>Overall, intragastric balloon therapy can be expected to achieve anywhere from 8 to 15% total body weight loss in the short term.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r39">[39]</xref>&#x000a0;This number is dependent on the type of balloon used. Pharmacotherapy and lifestyle interventions tend to have similar weight-loss results ranging from 2 to 9% of total body weight.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r40">[40]</xref>&#x000a0;In comparison, bariatric surgery can achieve an estimated total body weight loss of 13 to 30%, depending on the procedure performed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r41">[41]</xref>&#x000a0;The lower estimate is associated with laparoscopic adjustable bands and the sleeve gastrectomy procedure on the higher end. Multiple trials have demonstrated that intragastric balloons induce effective weight loss compared to lifestyle intervention alone, which served as a basis for the approval by the FDA for intragastric balloons.</p>
        <p>Currently, no trials directly compare pharmacotherapy methods of weight loss to the intragastric balloon. A meta-analysis of the individual therapies supports short-term weight loss achieved via the balloon, which compares favorably with pharmacological therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r40">[40]</xref>&#x000a0;One pharmacologic study has reported that the intragastric balloon typically produces a 6-month total body weight loss of 5.6%. This body weight loss is less than the FDA-approved weight-loss drug Qsymia, composed of phentermine and topiramate. The drug has a placebo-subtracted total body weight percentage measured at 6.6% at 6 months.&#x000a0;Direct comparative studies are required to determine intragastric balloon therapy efficacies compared to weight-loss drugs. Other medications approved for treating obesity can be used with intragastric balloon therapy to aid in weight loss, including semaglutide, liraglutide, phentermine, topiramate, and bupropion-naltrexone.</p>
        <p>Surgical interventions for weight loss are more efficacious for the patient, but as noted, certain circumstances or patient factors may limit the patient from undergoing such procedures. A retrospective study by the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network examined over 65,000 patients and discovered the total body weight loss at the 1-year and 5-year postoperative time frames.&#x000a0;At the 1-year mark, the average total body weight loss for the gastric bypass was 31.2%, sleeve gastrectomy was 25.2%, and the adjustable gastric band was 13.7%. At the 5-year postoperative mark, the average total body weight loss for the gastric bypass was 25.5%, the sleeve gastrectomy measured 18.8%, and the adjustable gastric band 11.7%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r41">[41]</xref>&#x000a0;With the large differences in weight-loss durability and efficacy, intragastric balloons should not be used instead of a bariatric operation when the latter is both feasible and appropriate for the patient.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r22">[22]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Additional Treatments</bold>
</p>
        <p>Additional measures may be needed for a patient to sustain or even augment weight loss after intragastric balloon therapy. These treatments can include pharmacologic, bariatric surgery, or repeat balloon therapy. It is estimated that with the continuation of an exercise regimen and diet, approximately 50% of weight loss achieved during the intragastric balloon therapy can be maintained at least 1-year post-balloon removal.&#x000a0;For a patient to undergo repeat balloon therapy, they must undergo a mandatory 1-month balloon holiday, meaning&#x000a0;4 weeks without a balloon. Studies demonstrate that these subsequent repeat therapies are as effective as the initial treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r42">[42]</xref>&#x000a0;To be considered for repeat therapy, patients should be evaluated individually. If the patient complies with exercise and diet during the initial treatment, they are likely a good candidate for subsequent treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r43">[43]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>An adjustable balloon system can be considered if a patient would like to undergo repeat balloon therapy. Studies have shown that approximately 80 to 90% of the weight loss achieved using intragastric balloon therapy is during the first 3 to 4 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r29">[29]</xref>&#x000a0;After this timeframe, the stomach accommodates, and the restricted mechanism is partially lost. Therefore, in an adjustable balloon system, the balloon volume may be increased to induce a higher level of weight loss. The adjustable Spatz balloon allows the adjustment of the balloon's volume. An adjustable system can be beneficial for patients intolerant of the balloon. They may benefit from a downward balloon volume adjustment, permitting patients to continue the treatment.</p>
        <p>Intragastric balloon therapy can be used in conjunction with bariatric operations for effective and safe weight loss in individuals with severe obesity. A study demonstrated that satisfactory results using the Orbera intragastric balloon predicted a favorable outcome with subsequent lap band surgery. Weight loss achieved with the intragastric balloon in the pre-operative stage aided in decreasing the risk and complexity of bariatric surgery in patients with a BMI greater than 50 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r44">[44]</xref>&#x000a0;Intragastric balloons can be used as a bridge to bariatric surgery, but the benefit may not be as dramatic as once thought. Trials that compared the balloon therapy versus a control before a bariatric operation demonstrated that the balloon did not prevent postoperative complications. It was associated with a 34% failure rate and a higher cost.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r45">[45]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r46">[46]</xref>&#x000a0;The weight loss was greater in the patients who underwent the balloon therapy prior, necessitating future studies to better evaluate these balloons as a bridging therapy mechanism for another procedure.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Conclusion</bold>
</p>
        <p>Currently, intragastric balloons serve as valuable adjuncts to bariatric patient therapy. Their usage is rising, given their minimally invasive and temporary nature. Currently, bariatric surgery provides higher efficacy of weight loss but has its risks, complications, and benefits compared to intragastric balloons. Minimally invasive treatments like the intragastric balloon, lifestyle modifications, and pharmacotherapy treatments are promising. Intragastric balloons may also serve as a bridging therapy for patients who do not meet the qualifications to undergo bariatric surgery or would like to avoid surgery. Intragastric balloons are worth consideration for these patients and should be discussed comprehensively and thoroughly with patients.</p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>The evaluation of the intragastric balloon and a multidisciplinary team approach was analyzed by a retrospective review of 119 balloons placed in 116 patients endoscopically from May 2001 to August 2006. In this review, 49 patients were followed by a multidisciplinary team every 15 days for 6 months, compared to 67 patients followed by individual providers.&#x000a0;The patients followed by the multidisciplinary team had the most significant decrease in excess body weight and BMI. Conclusions from this analysis demonstrate that intragastric balloon therapy effectively achieves short-term weight loss in obese patients and that a multidisciplinary team approach combined with lifestyle augmentation markedly enhances weight loss. A multidisciplinary team is recommended before, during, and after intragastric balloon placement.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131706.r47">[47]</xref></p>
