        <p>Illness anxiety disorder is a relatively new diagnosis, as it was first published in the fifth edition of the&#x000a0;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) in 2013.&#x000a0;Due to the novelty of this diagnosis, the prevalence of&#x000a0;IAD is largely unknown.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23261.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The prevalence of&#x000a0;IAD is estimated by the prevalence of the DSM-III and DSM-IV diagnosis of hypochondriasis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23261.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Among patients who were previously diagnosed with hypochondriasis (which is now an obsolete diagnosis), about 25% of patients meet the criteria for IAD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23261.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The prevalence of&#x000a0;IAD varies according to the study location (e.g.,&#x000a0;medical clinical setting&#x000a0;vs.&#x000a0;community).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23261.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23261.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;The estimated prevalence of IAD in the medical outpatient environment is about&#x000a0;0.75%, and in the general population, it is&#x000a0;about 0.1%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23261.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23261.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;IAD is common in adolescents with no gender preponderance, and it typically&#x000a0;worsens with age.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23261.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23261.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;IAD&#x000a0;is more common in unemployed and less educated persons.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23261.r1">[1]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-23261.s5" sec-type="History and Physical">
        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>People with illness anxiety disorder often seek initial care from their primary care provider as opposed to a mental health care provider. A diagnosis of&#x000a0;IAD is typically first speculated by primary care physicians when despite a normal physical examination, laboratory investigations, and repetitive assurances, the patients continue to have a severe disabling preoccupation and anxiety about an underlying serious medical condition. These patients often do not have somatic symptoms. If the somatic symptoms are present, they are only mild. If another medical condition is present, the preoccupation related to their health is clearly excessive and disproportionate to the severity of the condition.</p>
        <p>The patients with IAD typically remain dissatisfied with negative evaluations and consult multiple physicians for the same medical problem. They have a belief that their previous doctors were either incompetent or were not paying attention to detail and have missed their serious medical condition, which will have terrible consequences.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23261.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23261.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;The&#x000a0;patients may also reveal that they frequently check their bodies for skin lesions, hair loss, or physical changes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23261.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;They may also overthink about death and disability. They&#x000a0;are so preoccupied with their body-checking behaviors and&#x000a0;health concerns that their social and occupational functioning may be significantly impaired.</p>
        <p>Most of the patients with IAD belong to one of the two types:</p>
        <list list-type="order">
          <list-item>
            <p>A care-seeking type. These patients frequently utilize the health care system and keep changing their doctors. They may ask for multiple investigations and treatments.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23261.r1">[1]</xref></p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>A&#x000a0;care-avoidant type. These patients&#x000a0;avoid medical care. They have severe anxiety with the belief that the primary doctor or laboratory testing will reveal a life-threatening&#x000a0;illness (e.g., cancer).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23261.r1">[1]</xref></p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>The presence&#x000a0;of a general medical condition does not preclude a diagnosis of IAD. A general medical illness and&#x000a0;IAD&#x000a0;can be comorbid diagnoses. When a medical disorder is present,&#x000a0;IAD&#x000a0;is considered when health-related anxieties/preoccupations are out of proportion or excessive relative to the general medical disease.</p>

        <p>Illness anxiety disorder is a diagnosis of exclusion.

</p>
        <p>A. Excessive worry about having or developing a debilitating or life-threatening illness.</p>
        <p>B. Somatic symptoms are absent. If somatic symptoms are present, they are only mildly distressing to the patient. If a medical condition is present or a high-risk for developing a medical condition is present (due to family history), the anxiety regarding the medical condition (or potential impending medical condition) is excessive.</p>
        <p>C. Excessive concern and anxiety regarding health-related issues.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>D. The individual exhibits disproportionate and redundant health-related behaviors, such as repeatedly checking his or her body for indications of disease.</p>

        <p>A structured, interviewer-administered assessment titled "The Health Preoccupation Diagnostic Interview" is available, which aids in the diagnosis of IAD. This tool allows the interviewer to clarify a patient's responses and assists in the diagnosis&#x000a0;of IAD. It also differentiates IAD&#x000a0;from somatic symptom disorder and&#x000a0;healthy controls. The main limitations of this interview tool are that it is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and therefore is typically reserved for research purposes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23261.r2">[2]</xref></p>

        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>The treatment of patients with illness anxiety disorder primarily is focused on helping patients cope with their health anxieties. Primary&#x000a0;care&#x000a0;providers should aim to establish a rapport and therapeutic alliance with their patients so that patients feel comfortable in discussing their health concerns.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23261.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The concerns and fears of patients should be acknowledged. Statements such as "it's all in your head" should be avoided. If required, the patient may be referred to other healthcare specialists if necessary. Once a serious medical condition has been ruled out, and&#x000a0;a diagnosis of IAD has been established, the overutilization of the medical system, unnecessary imaging studies, specialist referrals, and laboratory investigations should be avoided. These patients should ideally be referred to a specialist health care professional or a psychiatrist. The primary care physician should make this referral in a tactful and non-judgemental way&#x000a0;so that the&#x000a0;patients&#x000a0;do not&#x000a0;feel invalidated or abandoned.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23261.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Patients should be scheduled for regular follow-ups with their primary care physician along with the psychiatrist. Frequent follow-ups will reduce visits to the emergency department or other physicians. It will also allow the physician to assess new complaints and associated triggers and stresses critically.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23261.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Psychotherapy is the first-line treatment for&#x000a0;IAD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23261.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on treating the patient's dysfunctional maladaptive cognitive beliefs&#x000a0;by&#x000a0;behavioral modification strategies.&#x000a0;It may address the patient's habits of excessive body checking for signs of illness.&#x000a0;CBT also includes education about&#x000a0;normal&#x000a0;somatic sensations and their normal variations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23261.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, group therapies, and acceptance and commitment therapy may also be instituted.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Pharmacological drugs are the second-line&#x000a0;treatment for&#x000a0;IAD.&#x000a0;Antidepressants such as&#x000a0;selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are proven to be effective in this condition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23261.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Patients who respond to antidepressant therapy are recommended to receive maintenance treatment&#x000a0;for at least 6 to 12 months.

        <title>Differential Diagnosis</title>
        <p>Initial assessment should attempt to rule out any general medical disorders. Following the exclusion of organicity, diagnoses pertinent on the list of differentials include&#x000a0;somatic symptom disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and body dysmorphic disorder.</p>
        <p>Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by multiple persistent somatic&#x000a0;symptoms&#x000a0;and excessive apprehension and anxiety regarding these symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23261.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;However, patients with&#x000a0;IAD typically experience minimal somatic symptoms and are more preoccupied with the belief that they are sick or diseased.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disorder in which patients experience intrusive, unwanted thoughts that are only relieved by performing behaviors or compulsions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23261.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;Compulsive behaviors demonstrated in obsessive-compulsive disorder are typically ritualized, repetitive, and stereotyped, e.g., repetitively checking door locks.

        <p>Patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have excessive worry and fear about almost all matters of daily living.&#x000a0;They may seem tensed, keyed up, on edge, and excessively worried.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23261.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Patients with IAD may be initially mistakenly diagnosed with&#x000a0;GAD.

        <p>Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by a preoccupation with perceived defects in physical appearance that are not apparent or barely noticeable to others.

        <p>It is crucial for general practitioners, internists, and family medicine physicians to be well informed about illness anxiety disorder&#x000a0;so that this psychiatric disorder may be recognized and treated appropriately.&#x000a0;IAD can pose a tremendous burden on the healthcare system as providers may be ordering expensive and unnecessary investigations and imaging.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23261.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Once&#x000a0;IAD is recognized, the primary care team needs to work closely with the mental health team so that collaborative care may be provided to the patient.
