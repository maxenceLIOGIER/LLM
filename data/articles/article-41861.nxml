        <p>The Florida Nurse Practice Act, supported by the Florida Board of Nursing, ensures that nursing professionals meet the necessary qualifications to provide safe and competent care to patients. As a key regulatory body, the Florida Board of Nursing upholds these standards through processes such as initial licensing, disciplinary actions, and continuing education&#x000a0;for individuals practicing nursing&#x000a0;across various healthcare settings in the state.&#x000a0;The Nurse Practice Act establishes a legal framework that outlines the standards for nursing practice and patient protection. The Board of Nursing oversees licensing, continuing education, and disciplinary actions to ensure compliance. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in license revocation and prohibit individuals from practicing nursing in Florida.</p>
        <p>The American Nurses Association Code of Ethics also offers guidance on ethical behavior, highlighting the importance of respect for human dignity, adherence to professional boundaries, and a commitment to patient-centered care.

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>The Florida Board of Nursing is&#x000a0;the regulatory body that ensures individuals are qualified to practice nursing in Florida. The essential functions include initial licensing, enforcing disciplinary actions, and overseeing continuing education for nurses. Additionally, the board monitors compliance with settlement agreements in cases of infractions and supervises the rehabilitation of disciplined members seeking to resume their nursing practice.</p>
        <p>The Florida Board of Nursing establishes minimum standards of care for nurses to ensure safe and competent healthcare delivery across various settings. Failure to meet these standards may result in the forfeiture of licensure and the inability to practice nursing in Florida. The Nurse Practice Act, enacted by the Florida Legislature, provides a framework for delivering safe, professional nursing care and offers essential protection for patients seeking such services.[<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm">2024 Florida Statutes</ext-link>]</p>
        <p>The Florida Department of State Administrative Code, Register, and Laws Section serves as the rulemaking authority for state regulatory agencies. Agency rulemaking is governed by Chapter 120 of the Florida Statutes and the Administrative Procedures Act, with regulations published in the Florida Administrative Code (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.flrules.org/about_us.asp">FLrules.org, About Us</ext-link>). Florida&#x000a0;Administrative Code section 64B9, overseen by the Florida Department of State, outlines laws and information governing essential aspects of nursing licensure and professional conduct.[<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm">2024 Florida Statutes</ext-link>]</p>
        <p>Nurse Practice Acts, enacted by all states and territories in the United States over 100 years ago, were designed to protect the public and establish nursing boards with the authority to develop specific regulations. These regulations ensure that laws are tailored to the nursing profession, providing clarity for license holders. Board rules must align with the legislation enacted and adopted under the Nurse Practice Act in each state or territory. The rules and regulations set forth by nursing boards carry the full force of the law and are enforceable.[<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncsbn.org">NCSBN.org</ext-link>]</p>
        <p>Nursing professionals must be familiar with their state's specific Nurse Practice Act as mandated by law. Healthcare professionals are responsible for staying informed about current regulations and cannot claim ignorance in legal matters. A misunderstanding or lack of knowledge of the law does not absolve them of responsibility and is not considered a valid excuse.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41861.r1">[1]</xref></p>

        <p>In 2017, a Gallup poll ranked nurses as the most trusted profession, underscoring their moral and ethical responsibility to practice within the legal framework (laws and regulations) established by their state's or territory's Nurse Practice Act.

Nurses are responsible&#x000a0;for understanding the essential elements of these laws as they relate to safe nursing care.
