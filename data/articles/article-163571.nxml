        <p>Kabuki syndrome (KS; also known as Kabuki make-up syndrome and Niikawa-Kuroki syndrome) is a rare inherited genetic syndrome first diagnosed in Japan in 1981 and is caused by mutations in an H3 lysine 4 methylase (<italic toggle="yes">KMT2D</italic>) or an X-linked histone H3 lysine 27 demethylase (<italic toggle="yes">KDM6A</italic>) gene.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-163571.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The syndrome has a heterogeneous phenotype and affects multiple organ systems.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-163571.r2">[2]</xref> The cardinal features of S include characteristic facial features (long palpebral fissures, eversion of the lateral one-third of the lower eyelid, arched eyebrows with lateral sparseness or notching, short nasal columella, large prominent or cupped ears, and cleft lip/palate), skeletal anomalies, dermatoglyphic anomalies, mild to moderate intellectual disability, and postnatal growth restriction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-163571.r3">[3]</xref> There is no treatment other than symptomatic management and prevention of complications.

        <p>KSK is caused by&#x000a0;variants in the&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">KMT2D</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">KDM6A</italic> genes.

        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>The pathogenesis of Kabuki syndrome is defined by epigenetic modifications during embryogenesis that regulate the expression level of genes (mainly <italic toggle="yes">KMT2D</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">KDM6A</italic>) by the on and off switch of chromatin.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-163571.r1">[1]</xref> KMT2D protein is a histone (H3) lysine&#x000a0;methyltransferase protein, and KDM6A is a histone demethylase protein, both with complementary functions. KMT2D protein plays a role in opening the chromatin, while KDM6A acts by closing the chromatin. The switch between open and closed&#x000a0;chromatin states affects the transcription process, ultimately causing the disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-163571.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>The <italic toggle="yes">KMT2D</italic> mutation affects normal growth and development by interrupting histone methylation related to gene expression. This mutated gene was the first pathogenic gene recognized in Kabuki syndrome, also known as <italic toggle="yes">MLL2</italic>. Recognized in 2010, this is the most common gene mutation in patients with Kabuki syndrome, found in 75% of cases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-163571.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-163571.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-163571.r3">[3]</xref> The proportion of cases caused by a de novo <italic toggle="yes">KMT2D</italic> mutation is unknown but is likely high.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-163571.r5">[5]</xref> The <italic toggle="yes">KMT2D</italic> gene is located on chromosome 12q13, which is expressed in most cells in the body. This encodes a large nucleoprotein that regulates histone methyltransferase activity, which methylates the Lys4 residue of histone H3 (H3K4). H3K4Me (methylated H3K4) activates transcriptional initiation sites on up to 75% of human genes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-163571.r1">[1]</xref> More than 50 mutations at different sites of <italic toggle="yes">KMT2D</italic> have been found, including nonsense, missense, frameshift mutations, small deletions, and splice site variants.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-163571.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-163571.r3">[3]</xref> Rare mosaic <italic toggle="yes">KMT2D</italic> cases have been identified.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-163571.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>The <italic toggle="yes">KDM6A</italic> mutation affects normal growth and development through similar mechanisms of <italic toggle="yes">KMT2D</italic>, as both genes belong to the same multiprotein complex. <italic toggle="yes">KDM6A</italic> (also known as <italic toggle="yes">UTX</italic>) is the second most pathologic gene, found in less than 5% of patients with Kabuki syndrome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-163571.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;This mutation is inherited in an X-linked manner;&#x000a0;the gene is located on Xp11.23 and encodes a histone (H3)-lysine 27-specific demethylase that interacts with <italic toggle="yes">KMT2D</italic> in regulating gene expression in the activating signal cointegrator-2-containing complex (ASCOM).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-163571.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-163571.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-163571.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Mutations of <italic toggle="yes">KDM6A</italic> include nonsense, frameshift, splice site, missense, large deletions, small insertions, and small deletions; a rare mosaic case of <italic toggle="yes">KDM6A</italic> has previously been identified.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-163571.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>The penetrance of pathogenic variants in <italic toggle="yes">KMT2D</italic> is not complete. The penetrance is unknown for pathogenic variants of <italic toggle="yes">KDM6A</italic>.

        <p>Hearing loss may require pressure-equalizing tubes or hearing aids. Cleft and palatal abnormalities will require repair with a craniofacial team. Genitourinary abnormalities should be managed by a nephrologist and urologist and may require surgical repair. Recurrent infections may require expertise with immunologic specialists with consideration of immunoglobulin therapy in those with immunoglobulin deficiency. Seizure disorders should be managed with anti-seizure medications and oversight from a neurologist.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-163571.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Short stature should be managed with consultation with an endocrinologist, and growth hormone should be considered.

        <p>All patients should have a baseline ophthalmology exam to assess for ophthalmologic issues such as strabismus, refractive abnormalities, corneal abnormalities, and ptosis. All patients should have a baseline echocardiogram to look for congenital heart defects. Chest radiographs should be considered to assess for diaphragmatic eventration in patients with respiratory problems, recurrent pneumonia, or chronic cough. A feeding team should be involved to assess for feeding difficulties. The mouth should be assessed for palatal abnormalities. A baseline renal ultrasound should be obtained to look for renal anomalies and a genitourinary exam should be performed to evaluate for abnormalities such as cryptorchidism and hypospadias A radiograph of the spine in patients with scoliosis should be obtained to assess for vertebral anomalies. Given the association with immunodeficiency, patients should have a T-cell count, T-cell subsets, and serum immunoglobulin levels at diagnosis or by 1 year of age. An echoencephalogram should be obtained for any patients with suspected seizures, and brain magnetic resonance imaging can be considered to evaluate for structural abnormalities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-163571.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>Neuropsychiatric and developmental assessments should be completed to assess for speech, cognitive, and motor skills as well as assess for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder.

        <p>Kabuki syndrome is a relatively new diagnosis (the first diagnosis was made in the early 1980s); data are lacking on long-term outcomes. Most patients with KS will live into adulthood.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-163571.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;However, the prognosis of patients with KS varies, given the heterogeneity of the syndrome.

        <title>Deterrence and Patient Education</title>
        <p>Patients and families should be educated on the clinical manifestations of KS to allow for early recognition and intervention and to prevent secondary complications. Some of the common symptoms that will require management are feeding difficulties, including the possibility of needing a gastrostomy tube, seizures requiring precautions and management, and intellectual and learning disabilities necessitating evaluation and support.&#x000a0;Patients and families should be cautioned against activities that increase the risk of joint damage if there is concern for joint laxity. Close follow-up with the pediatrician during and between annual well-child checks should be emphasized to monitor growth, development, hearing, and vision.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-163571.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>Families should receive genetic counseling on the inheritance pattern of Kabuki syndrome, such as the autosomal dominant pattern for <italic toggle="yes">KMT2D</italic> versus X-linked inheritance for <italic toggle="yes">KDM6A</italic>, which is essential for decision-making for subsequent pregnancies and existing siblings of the patients with this condition. Genetic counseling is also necessary for patients for future family planning. Parents should be counseled that in the rare case that a parent has an affected proband, the risk of a sibling having KS is 50%. For a child with a <italic toggle="yes">KDM6A</italic> mutation, parents should be counseled about X-linked inheritance; if the mother has an affected proband, the chance of passing it on to another child is 50% in each pregnancy. Parents should be counseled that boys who inherit the mutation will be affected and that girls who inherit the mutation will be heterozygous&#x02014;and may or may not have features of KS. Patients and families should be counseled that once a causative mutation is identified, prenatal testing for this syndrome is available.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-163571.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>Many patients with Kabuki syndrome may need assistance from a caregiver even into adulthood. Families and caregivers report significant challenges in caring for an affected individual. This burden is often due to serious medical manifestations of the condition, such as those that affect eating, hearing, and vision, as well as infections, seizures, and renal and cardiac problems. The need for frequent visits to healthcare facilities adds to this burden. Many caregivers report an impact on their emotional health, well-being, and ability to work outside the home.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-163571.r2">[2]</xref></p>

        <p>Clinicians, patients, and caregivers with Kabuki Syndrome would benefit from an improved understanding of the disease burden and its impact on patients' quality of life. The development of additional standard-of-care guidelines would improve the surveillance and management of these patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-163571.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Providing patient-centered care for individuals with KS requires a collaborative effort among healthcare professionals, including physicians, advanced care practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and others.&#x000a0;Clinicians must possess the necessary clinical skills and expertise&#x000a0;when diagnosing, evaluating, and managing this condition. Such skills include proficiency in identifying patients who may have this rare syndrome, accurately making the diagnosis, screening for and managing associated clinical manifestations, and implementing life-long surveillance to prevent potential complications. Utilizing evidence-based guidelines and individualized care plans tailored to each patient's unique circumstances is vital. Ethical considerations come into play when determining treatment options and respecting patient autonomy in decision-making.</p>
        <p>Responsibilities within the interprofessional team should be clearly defined, with each member contributing their specialized knowledge and skills to optimize patient care. Effective interprofessional communication fosters a collaborative environment where information is shared, questions are encouraged, and concerns are addressed promptly. Care coordination is also pivotal in ensuring seamless and efficient patient care. Physicians, advanced care practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals must work together to streamline the patient's journey, from diagnosis through treatment and follow-up. This coordination minimizes errors, reduces delays, and enhances patient safety, ultimately leading to improved outcomes and patient-centered care that prioritizes the quality of life for patients with Kabuki syndrome and their caregivers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-163571.r2">[2]</xref></p>
