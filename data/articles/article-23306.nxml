        <p>Hypotonia is an easily recognizable entity but determining the etiology is a challenging task for a clinician given its vast differential. Systematically approaching the case can help determine the underlying etiology, which is crucial for further management and prognosis of the disease. Having a multidisciplinary approach in the management of these patients has been found to have overall better outcomes. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of hypotonia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>The tone of the muscle is defined as a residual tension in a muscle at rest. It is a continuous and passive partial contraction of the muscles, which maintains posture. It is determined by resistance encountered with the passive stretching of a muscle or the passive movement of a limb at a joint. Hypotonia is a poor muscle tone resulting in floppiness. It is abnormally decreased resistance encountered with passive movement of the joint. It must be differentiated from weakness, which refers to a decrease in the maximum power a muscle can generate.</p>
        <p>Hypotonia may or may not be associated with muscle weakness. Although easily recognizable, it may be challenging for a clinician to determine the underlying cause of hypotonia. There is an extensive list of causes, but approaching the case systematically and obtaining a detailed history and physical examination can help reach a diagnosis. Determining the etiology is crucial for the management and prognostication. Specific treatments are available for some diseases, but treatment generally comprises supportive care with rehabilitation services and nutritional and respiratory support.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r5">[5]</xref></p>

        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>Hypotonia is usually present at birth and is frequently diagnosed in early infancy. There are numerous reasons for hypotonia in an infant. It can&#x000a0;result from muscle abnormalities, neuromuscular junctions, or central and peripheral nervous systems. It may also present in genetic disorders, metabolic diseases, endocrine problems, and acute or chronic illnesses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r5">[5]</xref> In about 50% of the cases of hypotonia, etiology can be determined with a detailed history and physical examination.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r2">[2]</xref> Central causes include hypoxic encephalopathy, brain anomalies/insults, genetic/chromosomal syndromes, congenital or acquired infections, and disorders of metabolism. Peripheral causes include spinal muscular atrophy, myasthenia gravis, drug/toxin exposure, hereditary neuropathies, muscular dystrophies, congenital&#x000a0;or metabolic myopathies, and congenital myotonic dystrophies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r5">[5]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-23306.s4" sec-type="Epidemiology">
        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>The exact incidence of hypotonia is difficult to determine because it is not a disease but a presenting feature of various diseases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r4">[4]</xref> The majority of the cases of hypotonia are congenital. Central pathology accounts for most congenital hypotonias. These typically include hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy or genetic abnormalities. Central hypotonia is seen in up to 60%-80% of cases. Down syndrome is the most common genetic cause of central hypotonia, followed by Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Metabolic diseases, including peroxisomal and storage disorders, are rare causes of central hypotonia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>Peripheral and unknown causes account for the rest. The most commonly seen peripheral causes include spinal muscle atrophy, congenital muscular dystrophy, and congenital myopathies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r5">[5]</xref> Spinal muscular atrophy has an incidence of 1 in 6,000 to 1 in 10,000 live births.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r6">[6]</xref> Acquired hypotonias can be due to toxins or infections, including infant botulism. Even though worldwide incidence is rare, most cases are diagnosed in the USA, which can be attributed to clinician awareness. In the United States, California, Pennsylvania, and Utah have a high incidence of infant botulism, with about 50% of cases in California.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r7">[7]</xref></p>

        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>
<bold>History</bold>
</p>
        <p>Initial evaluation starts with a detailed history, including family prenatal and perinatal history. The developmental history of the child, as well as of the parents, can also aid in the diagnosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r5">[5]</xref> Attention should also be paid to the presence of hypotonia in the family members with a known cause, such as muscular diseases, genetic disorders, and consanguineous marriage.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r3">[3]</xref> Prenatal and perinatal history includes details about fetal movements, presentation at birth, amniotic fluid amount throughout pregnancy, and complications during delivery. Details regarding maternal exposure to toxins&#x000a0;or drugs, any infections during pregnancy, mode of delivery, gestational age, and Apgar score at birth must also be obtained.</p>
        <p>Information regarding the onset of hypotonia and the clinical course can also help to determine the etiology. For example, hypotonia at birth with poor Apgar score may indicate hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, whereas poor muscle tone developing 12 to 24 hours after birth may indicate a metabolic disorder.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r5">[5]</xref> Infants with central hypotonia usually have a higher prevalence of cognitive delays. A standardized neurodevelopmental assessment must be done in older children. The Bayley scale (Bayley-III) may be used. It covers the ages from 1 to 42 months and assesses motor, cognitive, language, and social-emotional domains of development. However, the assessment with Bayley-III or any other standardized scale may be difficult when the infant has a profound weakness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r3">[3]</xref> A careful review of all organ systems must be included, as it may aid in diagnosing the underlying etiology.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Physical Examination </bold>
</p>
        <p>A detailed physical examination, along with a comprehensive neurologic examination, must be done. Paying attention to dysmorphic features or any associated congenital malformations. The shape and size of the head must be included as well. Muscular strength should be evaluated in a child with hypotonia. It should also be determined if the hypotonia has progressed or remained static since onset. The infant's tone can be assessed by using 4 maneuvers:</p>
        <p>
<bold>Vertical suspension</bold>
</p>
        <p>In vertical suspension, an infant is held under the arms. A hypotonic infant would slip through the examiner's hands. This mainly assesses the appendicular tone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Horizontal suspension</bold>
</p>
        <p>The horizontal suspension is tested by lifting the infant in a prone position with a hand over the chest and abdomen. Typically, an alert and a term infant would have some flexion of arms and legs and the ability to hold the head above the horizontal for some time. An infant with hypotonia would form an inverted "U" posture.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>"The Scarf Sign" </bold>
</p>
        <p>"Scarf sign" assesses the appendicular tone in the shoulders. In this, the infant lies supine, and the hand is pulled across the chest as far as possible before encountering resistance. Usually, infant resistance is encountered when the elbow reaches the midline. In a hypotonic infant, the elbow can go beyond the midline before any resistance is encountered.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>"Pull-to-sit" maneuver</bold>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r5">[5]</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r8">[8]</xref>
</p>
        <p>The pull-to-sit maneuver involves pulling a supine infant to a sitting position. Head lag can be noticed in newborns, but it should disappear by 2 months of age. Hypotonic infants would have a significant head lag. This maneuver mainly explains the axial tone in the neck and back muscles. The strength of the shoulder and arms can also be assessed with the "pull to sit" maneuver as the infants flex the arms while attempting it.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>It is usually challenging to determine muscle strength in an infant. Weakness may be manifest as decreased spontaneous movements. This can be tested by evaluating the cry, suck reflex, spontaneous movements, facial expressions, antigravity movements, and respiratory effort. When assessing weakness in an infant, the course and area of involvement must also be noted.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r5">[5]</xref> These findings may be confounded in a severe systemic illness (eg, sepsis) or medications (eg, magnesium or sedatives). This can be overcome by examining the patient on 2 separate occasions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <p>Patients with central hypotonia usually have a depressed level of consciousness, normal muscle strength, reflexes that may be normal or exaggerated, and the persistence of primitive reflexes and clonus. They may also have dysmorphic features and congenital abnormalities, pointing towards a syndromic cause of hypotonia. These findings vary in severity and prevalence, depending on the underlying cause.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>In the case of peripheral hypotonia, the patient has a variable degree of impairment in moving the extremities against gravity. The infant is usually alert, has a normal sleep-wake pattern, and responds to the surroundings appropriately. There is usually no cognitive impairment; however, gross and fine motor skills might be delayed. The reflexes are usually reduced or absent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;Patients often have feeding difficulties, respiratory impairment, and impaired ocular and facial movements.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r5">[5]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-23306.s6" sec-type="Evaluation">
        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>To reach a correct diagnosis in a hypotonic newborn, it is essential to proceed systematically. The initial assessment is aimed at ruling out systemic disorders. Examination for abnormalities of deep tendon reflexes and ligament laxity helps consider peripheral causes.</p>
        <p>If suspected, sepsis must be ruled out with blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures. Additionally, obtaining a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic profile, magnesium, and a drug screen. If the neonate is found to have hepatosplenomegaly or calcification on a head ultrasound, then a workup for congenital infection should be initiated. It includes&#x000a0;toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, human immunodeficiency virus&#x000a0;(TORCH) titers, urine&#x000a0;cytomegalovirus studies, and Zika virus testing. To assess the central causes of hypotonia, a workup should be done to look for genetic and metabolic disease as a cause. In the presence of dysmorphic features or congenital malformations, a chromosome analysis with routine karyotyping or specific testing for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can aid in diagnosing certain diseases such as Down syndrome and PWS</p>
        <p>Metabolic disorder screening is done when there is multisystemic involvement. Screening for carbohydrate and mitochondrial disorders with lactate and pyruvate levels may be done. Altered levels of plasma amino acids and urine organic acids may indicate an underlying amino acid disorder or organic acidemia. Acylcarnitine and total carnitine levels can be obtained for organic and fatty acid metabolism defects. More specific testing may be done for peroxisomal disorders with very long-chain fatty acids and plasmalogens. When peripheral hypotonia is suspected, a creatine kinase (CK) level should be taken. In muscular dystrophies, CK is typically very elevated (&#x0003e;10x normal).</p>
        <p>Electrophysiologic studies can be used as a screening tool for peripheral causes of hypotonia. However, performing and interpreting in a neonate or a young infant may be difficult. They can differentiate among disorders involving nerves, muscle, or neuromuscular junctions. If CK is mildly elevated (&#x0003c;10x normal) and electromyography (EMG) is myopathic, then a muscle biopsy will be needed. Muscle biopsy with immunohistochemical staining and electron microscopy can help differentiate between muscular dystrophies and myopathies. Although an invasive procedure, it plays an important role in diagnosis and guiding further workup. If the EMG is neuropathic, then testing for&#x000a0;spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), hereditary sensorimotor neuropathy, and Dejerin-Sottas syndrome should be done.</p>
        <p>Decrement or facilitation of EMG would suggest the disease of the neuromuscular junction. Radiologic evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) of the brain can aid in diagnosing various causes of central hypotonia. Structural changes, migration defects, brain stem defects (Joubert syndrome), and abnormal signaling defects in the white matter and brain stem can be seen in neuroimaging. Magnetic resonance spectrometry can be useful in diagnosing certain metabolic disorders.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r8">[8]</xref></p>

        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>In general, the treatment is supportive and, most of the time, takes precedence over finding the underlying cause. It is tailored to the symptoms of the infant and may depend on the underlying cause. An interprofessional team approach leads to better outcomes for patients. Rehabilitation, nutritional, and respiratory support must be provided. In cases of central hypotonia other than hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, the involvement of a metabolic expert and a geneticist is essential. Occupational, speech, and physical therapy are beneficial and crucial in maximizing muscle function and preventing secondary anatomic deformities. Nutritional support is very important in these patients as they are often underweight and have various macro- and micronutrient deficiencies. Their requirements may increase during illness, and it must be addressed. In severe cases of chest muscle weakness, nasogastric or percutaneous gastrostomy tubes are needed for nutrition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>Specific treatment can be provided in certain cases, such as Pompe disease, where early enzyme replacement therapy can significantly improve the outcome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r4">[4]</xref> Recently, few treatments have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for SMA, although these are among the most expensive treatments available. Spinraza is a gene therapy that repairs the <italic toggle="yes">SMN2</italic> gene. Zolgensma replaces the missing or defective <italic toggle="yes">SMN1</italic> gene.

        <p>Genetic counseling must be done for parents. Prenatal testing and testing for at-risk relatives must be offered whenever applicable.

<bold>Central Hypotonia</bold>
</p>
        <p>Systemic diseases affecting the central nervous system are the most frequent cause of hypotonia in neonates. Congestive heart failure in an infant born with a congenital heart defect is a frequent cause of hypotonia in newborns. Since most of the energy is used in breathing and pumping the blood to the body, the infants have significant hypotonia and weakness. Strength is difficult to assess because of the lack of any voluntary effort by an acutely ill infant. Another common cause is sepsis, which often presents with hypotonia, which can sometimes be severe as well. Newborns who have suffered a hypoxic-ischemic insult present with depressed consciousness in the neonatal period along with hypotonia. As time progresses, the infant gains consciousness and has increased tone and hyperreflexia by the end of 2&#x000a0;to 3 months. Metabolic disorders also present with generalized hypotonia, but these infants commonly have an altered mental status. They may also appear septic, but the diagnosis is only made once the metabolic screen results are available.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Genetic and chromosomal causes account for a large number of causes of hypotonia. Numerous genetic syndromes can lead to hypotonia, and it can be difficult for a clinician to identify them without the help of a genetic expert. They present with central hypotonia, dysmorphic features, developmental abnormalities, and positive family history in most cases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <p>Down syndrome (trisomy 21) is the most common chromosomal cause. Characteristic features include an up-slanting palpebral fissure, flat facial profile, single transverse palmar crease, and poor Moro reflex. Diagnosis can be confirmed with a high-resolution chromosome analysis or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>PWS is among the differential diagnoses in the case of unexplained hypotonia in neonates. Most cases (65%-75%) are due to a lack of expression of genes inherited paternally on chromosome 15. About one-fourth of cases are due to maternal disomy 15 (when both chromosomes are inherited from the mother, and there is an absence of paternal-derived chromosome 15). Very few cases are caused by a defect in the genetic imprinting. Patients with PWS have feeding difficulty, hypotonia, and failure to thrive in early infancy. This is replaced by excessive appetite and obesity in late infancy and childhood.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r10">[10]</xref> Methylation analysis or a FISH can be used to make the diagnosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>Peroxisomal disorders result from mutations in any of the 12 <italic toggle="yes">PEX</italic> genes, the most common being the <italic toggle="yes">PEX 1</italic> gene. These disorders can fall anywhere along the spectrum of severity. Zellweger syndrome is the most severe form, and infantile reflex is the least severe form.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r4">[4]</xref> They are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Patients usually present with significant hypotonia and poor feeding in the newborn period. The liver, kidneys, eyes, brain, bones, and adrenals are involved. Diagnosis is based on the levels of very-long-chain fatty acids, with elevated levels of C26 and C26:1. Additionally, there is an elevated ratio of C26/C22 and C24/C22, along with elevation in the plasma levels of pristanic acid and phytanic acid.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r11">[11]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r12">[12]</xref></p>
        <p>Benign congenital hypotonia is a nonprogressive disorder of the neuromuscular system. It is commonly seen and is a diagnosis of exclusion. Muscle tone improves with age, but the patient often has delayed milestone achievement. History and physical examination are not suggestive of a neurologic or metabolic cause. Routine blood tests, including muscle enzyme results, are normal. It is associated with the risk of joint dislocations later in life, and parents must be counseled about it.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r5">[5]</xref> &#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Pompe disease, a rare autosomal recessive disease, is caused by acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency. There is an accumulation of glycogen in the lysosomes in the heart and the skeletal muscle tissue. It can present as the classic infantile Pompe disease with less than 1% enzyme activity. It is seen in the neonatal period with marked hypotonia, failure to thrive, and hepatomegaly, which often leads to death within the first year of life due to cardiac or respiratory causes if untreated.

        <p>Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disease that involves the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and motor nuclei of the brainstem. It is a progressive neuromuscular degenerative disorder that results in proximal muscle weakness and paralysis. There are 4 main types of SMA (SMA 1, SMA 2, SMA 3, and SMA 4), based on the age at which the disease presents (from pre- and perinatal to adulthood) and the maximum motor function achieved.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;Clinical features include symmetric proximal muscle weakness, atrophy, tongue fasciculations, and decreased to absent reflexes. These patients are also at increased risk of aspirations and failure to thrive.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r9">[9]</xref> The weakness usually progresses to respiratory insufficiency and, eventually, death.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r5">[5]</xref> Patients have normal cognition regardless of the type.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r4">[4]</xref></p>

Characteristic features include hypotonia, feeding difficulties, expressionless face, progressively weakening cry, ptosis, and respiratory problems that may progress to cyanosis and apnea.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;Diagnosis is usually made with EMG showing abnormal compound action potential with repetitive low-frequency stimulation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r4">[4]</xref> The patient's response to subcutaneous or intravenous injection of edrophonium chloride can also be used for diagnosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>The transient acquired myasthenic syndrome is seen in neonates born to mothers with myasthenia gravis. There are antibodies against the acetylcholine receptors in the mother, which passively transfer to the placenta and interfere with the neuromuscular transmission in the neonate. Symptoms are seen within 2&#x000a0;to 3 days of life and resolve within 2 to 4 weeks with complete recovery. The amount of antibody transferred across the placenta directly correlates with the severity of the symptoms. Symptoms include feeding difficulties, hypotonia, swallowing, and sucking difficulties, and they usually have a weak cry with an expressionless face. There may or may not be respiratory insufficiency. Treatment is symptomatic, which may include exchange transfusion, respiratory support as needed, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>Clostridium botulinum, an anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria, causes infantile botulism. The spores are present in the soil and are also present in honey. Ingestion of spores leads to the colonization of bacteria in the gut and leads to the release of a potent neurotoxin. The toxin produced is absorbed from the intestines. It acts on the presynaptic receptors, and the release of acetylcholine is inhibited. In foodborne botulism, the preformed toxin is ingested, whereas in infantile botulism, the toxin is produced in the gut. The toxin is continuously produced in infantile botulism as bacterial colonization of the large intestine. The affected age group is usually younger than 1 year, with a peak incidence at about 3 months. More severe symptoms are noticed in infants younger than 2 months of age. The first symptom to present is often constipation. Other characteristic features include cranial nerve involvement, respiratory problems, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and decreased reflexes. The weakness appears to progress in a descending fashion. Diagnosis is made by isolating <italic toggle="yes">Clostridium botulinum</italic> bacteria or the botulinum neurotoxin from the stool. The prognosis is relatively good as recovery will be complete, but it takes several months. If proper care is provided, there is a less than 2% case-fatality rate. Treatment is mostly supportive care with special attention to pulmonary hygiene and nutritional support. Antibiotics are avoided as they are not known to have any benefit, and they may lead to lysis of bacteria in the intestines, releasing large amounts of toxins.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r7">[7]</xref></p>

        <p>Aminoglycosides provide coverage against gram-negative bacteria and are commonly used in neonates and infants when there is a concern for sepsis and meningitis. They are potentially toxic and can cause renal toxicity, ototoxicity, and neuromuscular blockade. Gentamicin has been found to have maximum neuromuscular blocking action. The effects on the neuromuscular junction are greater in the case of preterm neonates due to immature renal function, which leads to higher levels of the drug in the serum. Clinical features include muscle weakness and hypotonia. Aminoglycosides must be avoided in patients with neuromuscular junction disorders such as infantile botulism and myasthenia-like syndromes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>A magnesium level of more than 1.15 mmol/L (2.8 mg/dL) is hypermagnesemia in neonates. It is frequently seen in babies born to mothers who received treatment for eclampsia with magnesium sulfate. Clinical features include hypotonia, hypo/areflexia, respiratory depression, poor feeding, bradycardia, and ileus. Monitoring the magnesium level and providing supportive care are often sufficient.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23306.r2">[2]</xref> &#x000a0;</p>

        <title>Prognosis</title>
        <p>The prognosis depends on the underlying etiology. In some cases, such as transient myasthenia and infantile botulism, there is complete recovery with minimal to no complications. Hypotonia in sepsis or due to other illnesses like&#x000a0;congestive heart failure also improves once the disease is treated. Certain conditions, such as spinal muscular atrophy and Pompe disease (classic infantile type), can be fatal early in life. Having an interprofessional team approach toward the patient by providing rehabilitation services, nutritional support, and home care services and involving various specialists can alter the prognosis, leading to better outcomes.</p>
