        <p>Postpartum depression (PPD) is a prevalent and potentially severe mood disorder that affects approximately 1 in 7 women within the first year after childbirth. PPD stems from a combination of hormonal changes, genetic predisposition, and environmental factors, yet up to 50% of cases remain undiagnosed due to the stigma surrounding the condition and patients' reluctance to disclose symptoms. Unlike the transient "baby blues," PPD is more severe, often manifesting as persistent sadness, low self-esteem, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and difficulties bonding with the baby. Effective recognition and management of PPD are essential for optimizing the health outcomes of the parent and infant.</p>
        <p>This activity describes the evaluation of postpartum depression and how to differentiate it from other mood disorders that may occur in the postpartum period. Participants learn to identify the various etiologies and clinical presentations of PPD, as well as the underlying biochemical and psychological pathways. This activity also emphasizes the importance of routine screening using tools like the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and also highlights the roles of psychotherapy, support groups, and safe medications in treatment. Collaborating with an interprofessional healthcare team is highlighted, helping participants enhance their ability to implement best practices for treating and preventing PPD, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Regulatory guidelines are also covered to ensure a standardized approach to PPD care.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Postpartum depression (PPD) is a mood disorder that affects individuals within 1 year after childbirth. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5), postpartum depression is now included in the term perinatal depression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;A major depressive episode that begins during pregnancy or within 4 weeks after delivery is classified as peripartum depression. This term encompasses both prenatal and postpartum depression. The DSM-5 does not recognize PPD as a separate entity. Instead, PPD is included within the broader diagnosis of peripartum depression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Unlike the "baby blues," which typically resolve within a few weeks, PPD is more severe and can last for months if untreated.</p>
        <p>Depression symptoms, including persistent sadness, lack of interest, low self-esteem, sleep disturbances, loss of appetite, anxiety, irritability with a hostile attitude towards infants, self-blame, and feelings of humiliation characterize PPD. People with PPD may also experience changes in sleeping and eating patterns, difficulty bonding with their baby, and feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Recognizing and addressing PPD is crucial for the health and well-being of the patient and their baby. If left untreated, PPD can interfere with&#x000a0;the ability to care for the child and may contribute to long-term developmental issues in the child (eg, emotional and behavioral problems). PPD can also strain family relationships and increase the risk of suicide.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>Screening for PPD should be a routine part of postpartum care, utilizing tools such as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) to identify those at risk. Treatment typically involves a combination of psychotherapy, support groups, and medication, including antidepressants, which can safely be used during lactation. Up to 50% of PPD cases remain undiagnosed due to patient reluctance to disclose symptoms, partly because of the stigma around PPD, which includes fears of abandonment and lack of support upon disclosure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Raising awareness about PPD, reducing stigma, and ensuring access to mental health resources are essential steps in supporting new parents and promoting healthy family dynamics.</p>

        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>The exact cause of PPD is not fully understood, but potential underlying etiologies contributing to the development of this condition include hormonal changes, genetic predisposition, and psychosocial stressors. The rapid drop in estrogen and progesterone levels after delivery, coupled with the stress and sleep deprivation that often accompany caring for a newborn, can trigger depressive episodes in susceptible people.</p>
        <p>In a meta-analysis of 33 studies, gestational diabetes, having boy infants, a history of depression, and epidural anesthesia use were noted as risk factors. However, further research is needed to assess the true significance of these reported risk factors, especially the sex of the infant and the use of epidural anesthesia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Besides hormonal, other changes in many metabolic pathways may be&#x000a0;associated with the development of postpartum depression, including alterations in energy metabolism, the purine and amino acid cycles, steroid and neurotransmitter metabolism, and exposure to xenobiotics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r6">[6]</xref></p>

        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>The pathogenesis of PPD is currently unknown but is likely multifactorial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;Genetic, hormonal, psychological, and social life stressors have been suggested to play a role in PPD development.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r11">[11]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r12">[12]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r13">[13]</xref>&#x000a0;The role of reproductive hormones in depressive behavior suggests neuroendocrine pathophysiology for PPD. Ample data advocating that changes in the reproductive hormones stimulate the dysregulation of these hormones in sensitive individuals has been documented. The pathophysiology of PPD can be caused by alterations of multiple biological and endocrine systems, for example,&#x000a0;the immunological system, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), and lactogenic hormones.</p>
        <p>The HPA is known to be involved in the disease process of postpartum depression. The HPA axis causes the release of cortisol in trauma and stress; with HPA axis dysfunction, the release of catecholamines is decreased, leading to a poor&#x000a0;stress response. HPA-releasing hormones increase during pregnancy and remain elevated up to 12 weeks postpartum. Recent evidence suggests that PPD is linked to the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission system. The imbalance in GABA, the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, likely plays a role in causing PPD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r10">[10]</xref></p>
        <p>The rapid drop in reproductive hormones like estradiol and progesterone following delivery can be a potential stressor in patients who are susceptible, and these changes can lead to the onset of depressive symptoms. Elevated cortisol levels and low tryptophan levels may be noted.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r6">[6]</xref> Oxytocin and prolactin also play an essential role in the pathogenesis of PPD. These&#x000a0;hormones regulate the milk let-down reflex and the synthesis&#x000a0;of breast milk. Failure to lactate and the onset of PPD are often observed to coincide. Low levels&#x000a0;of oxytocin are particularly observed in PPD and unwanted early weaning. During the third trimester, lower levels of oxytocin are associated with increased depressive symptoms during pregnancy&#x000a0;and following delivery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r14">[14]</xref></p>

            <p>Somatic symptoms, including anhedonia, unusual&#x000a0;waking in the very early morning, agitation, weight loss, loss of libido, decreased appetite, and marked psychomotor retardation are noted. These symptoms may vary daily and are not responsive to a change in circumstances.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>A depressive episode may be classified as mild, moderate, or severe, depending&#x000a0;on the severity and number of the symptoms.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>The signs and symptoms of PPD are identical to nonpuerperal depression with an additional history of childbirth. Symptoms include depressed mood, loss of interest, changes in sleep patterns, change in appetite, feelings of worthlessness, inability to concentrate, and suicidal ideation. Women may also experience anxiety. Patients with PPD may also have psychotic symptoms, which include delusions and hallucinations, such as voices saying to harm infants. PPD may lead to poor maternal-infant bonds, failure of breastfeeding, harmful parenting practices, marital discord, as well as worse outcomes concerning the child's physical and psychological development. The remission of symptoms reduces the risk of behavioral and psychiatric problems in the offspring. A prior episode of PPD increases the future risk of major depression, bipolar disorder, and PPD. Past personal and family histories of PPD and postpartum psychosis should also be noted.</p>

        <p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the American Academy of Family Medicine (AAFP) all recommend screening every patient for&#x000a0;postpartum depression using the EPDS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r3">[3]</xref> During the evaluation, the inclusion of drug and alcohol history, smoking habits, and all prescription and over-the-counter drug medications is essential.

        <p>Several screening tools are available, though the most frequently used is the EPDS, a 10-item questionnaire completed by patients within a few minutes. A score &#x02265;13 is&#x000a0;associated with&#x000a0;an increased risk of developing PPD and provides the basis for additional clinical assessment.

<bold>Antidepressant Medications</bold>
</p>
        <p>The first-line treatment&#x000a0;for peripartum&#x000a0;depression&#x000a0;is psychotherapy and antidepressant medications. Psychotherapy is the first-line&#x000a0;treatment&#x000a0;option for patients with mild to moderate peripartum&#x000a0;depression. A combination of therapy and antidepressant medications is recommended for moderate to severe&#x000a0;depression. Referral to a behavioral health resource may also be recommended.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r15">[15]</xref>&#x000a0;ACOG recommends using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants for PPD medical therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the first choice medications for PPD. Consideration should be given to switching to serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors or mirtazapine if selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are ineffective. Sertraline or escitalopram are good first-line choices for medical therapy. Sertraline has extensive and reassuring safety research. Fluoxetine and paroxetine, if previously used effectively for a specific individual, may be considered despite an increased risk of neonatal adaptation syndrome. As such, the&#x000a0;treatment for patients who have had successful&#x000a0;medical therapy with an antidepressant in the past should be allowed to resume that effective medication during or after pregnancy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r15">[15]</xref></p>
        <p>The goal of treatment for PPD is remission or resolution of symptoms of depression. The same screening tool should be used to track symptoms. An improvement of 50% or more defines a treatment response. Algorithms may be used to help in adjusting dosages of medications with&#x000a0;continued use of the Patient Health Questionairre-9 or EPDS. Inadequately or untreated mental health conditions are associated with perinatal risks, as are any pharmacologic agents; the risks of both need to be recognized.&#x000a0;The lowest effective dose of medication should be used to achieve illness remission. However, avoiding undertreatment, which is common in obstetrics, is critical. Polypharmacy and switching medications should be avoided if remission is possible with the use of a single agent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r15">[15]</xref>&#x000a0;Although benefits may be reported within 1 week of the start of oral therapy, symptom improvement may take 4 to 8 weeks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>Once an effective dose is reached, continued treatment for at least 6 to 12 months is recommended to prevent relapse of symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r18">[18]</xref>&#x000a0;Discontinuation of medical therapy during pregnancy or in the postpartum period results in a high risk of recurrence and is not recommended; also, discontinuing medication in the third trimester to mitigate the risk of neonatal adaptation syndrome is not recommended. Additionally, abrupt discontinuation of both&#x000a0;selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors is associated with complications unless a progressive taper over 2 to 4 weeks is used. Discontinuation symptoms may include gastrointestinal upset, agitation, anxiety, headache, dizziness, fatigue, sleep disruption, tremors, myalgias, and electric-like shocks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r15">[15]</xref></p>
        <p>Pharmacologic recommendations for people who are lactating should include discussing the benefits of breastfeeding, the risks of antidepressant use during lactation, and the risks of untreated illness. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is a treatment that may provide an alternative option for people who breastfeed and are concerned about their babies being exposed to medication. The risk of breastfeeding while taking a serotonin reuptake inhibitor is relatively low, and patients can be encouraged to breastfeed while on antidepressants. After 12 weeks, cognitive behavioral therapy, sertraline monotherapy, and combination therapy were helpful.&#x000a0;The cognitive behavioral therapy monotherapy group found the most accelerated initial gains after treatment startup.&#x000a0;</p>

<bold>Neurosteroid Therapy</bold>
</p>
        <p>Brexanolone, an intravenous neurosteroid that positively acts at the GABA-A receptors, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2019, specifically for PPD. Brexanolone may be considered for use with moderate to severe depression in the third trimester or postpartum. Patients must be enrolled in the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy Program.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r19">[19]</xref>&#x000a0;Brexanolone has a rapid onset of action but is hard to access and may be cost-prohibitive. No data supports its safety with breastfeeding or efficacy beyond 30 days of use. Inpatient monitoring for increased sedative effects, sudden loss of consciousness, and hypoxia during infusion is required.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r15">[15]</xref></p>
        <p>Brexanolone, an analog of allopregnanolone, a metabolite of progesterone, was the first medication approved by the FDA for the treatment of moderate to severe postpartum depression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r19">[19]</xref>&#x000a0;Brexanolone is administered intravenously as a continuous 60-hour infusion lasting approximately 2.5 days. Multiple clinical trials demonstrate that brexanolone is usually well-tolerated in women with moderate to severe&#x000a0;PPD and can provide a rapid beneficial response.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r20">[20]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r21">[21]</xref>&#x000a0;Breastfeeding is not recommended during and for 4 days after brexanolone infusion therapy. More clinical trials are needed to assess further the long-term safety and efficacy of brexanolone in treating PPD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r15">[15]</xref></p>
        <p>Zuranolone, a neuroactive steroid like brexanolone, is also a GABA-A receptor modulator that was FDA-approved on August 4, 2023, for PPD management. A&#x000a0;50-mg oral dose every night is given with a fat-containing (700 cal; 30% fat)&#x000a0;meal for 14 days. Zuranolone may be used alone or in combination with oral antidepressants. The onset of action is rapid, from hours to days, which helps give more immediate relief. Because of the central nervous system depression seen with zuranolone, patients should be counseled that their driving ability may be reduced. Also, zuranolone has been suggested to produce harmful effects on the fetus during pregnancy and lactation. Overall, zuranolone is well tolerated and has minimal side effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;The most common adverse event reported by over 26% of patients was somnolence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r22">[22]</xref>&#x000a0;Because safety and effectiveness have not yet been studied, zuranolone&#x000a0;is not recommended to be continued for longer than 14 days.</p>

<bold>Nonpharmacologic Therapies</bold>
</p>
        <p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a noninvasive procedure that uses magnetic waves to stimulate and activate nerve cells in a targeted area of the brain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r23">[23]</xref> These cells are underactive in people with major depression. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is usually done&#x000a0;once a day for 4 to 6 weeks to be effective. This therapy may be&#x000a0;used in patients who are not responding to antidepressants and psychotherapy. Generally, transcranial magnetic stimulation is safe and well-tolerated, but some side effects can include headaches, lightheadedness, scalp discomfort, and facial muscle twitching. Some serious side effects are rare, including seizures, hearing loss if ear protection is not adequate, and mania in people with bipolar disorder.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r24">[24]</xref>&#x000a0;Although early results are promising, future studies are needed to address the benefits of transcranial magnetic stimulation for PPD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r23">[23]</xref></p>
        <p>Patients with severe&#x000a0;PPD may not respond to psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. For patients refractory to&#x000a0;4 consecutive&#x000a0;medication trials, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be recommended. ECT is beneficial in&#x000a0;patients with&#x000a0;psychotic depression, with intent or plans on committing suicide or infanticide, and refusal to eat, leading to malnutrition and dehydration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r25">[25]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r26">[26]</xref>&#x000a0;Several observational studies have suggested ECT as a safer option for lactating patients as there are fewer adverse events for&#x000a0;the mother and the infant.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r27">[27]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r28">[28]</xref>&#x000a0;Other authors are not as supportive of ECT use for PPD.&#x000a0;</p>

Usually, onset is within 3 to 10 days postpartum but may occur over 4 weeks postpartum. Postpartum psychosis is a psychiatric emergency with potential suicide and infanticidal risk. A patient can experience hallucinations, agitation, unusual behavior, disorganized thoughts, and delusions.

        <p>Dose adjustments may be needed based on monitoring symptoms through clinical assessment, validated screening tools, or both. Due to increased renal clearance, increased distribution volume, and changes in enzyme activity with advancing gestation, an increase in medication dose during pregnancy may be required. Empiric down-titration of psychiatric medications in the third trimester is not recommended as neonatal outcomes were not improved, and the associated risk of worsening mental health conditions was noted.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27543.r15">[15]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>

Data reveal that the condition also affects parent-infant bonding. Often, the child is treated inappropriately with a negative attitude that can significantly impact the child's growth and development. Children born to patients with&#x000a0;PPD have been found to exhibit marked changes in behavior, altered cognitive development, and early onset of depressive illness. More importantly, these children&#x000a0;may struggle with&#x000a0;obesity and dysfunction in social interactions.</p>

        <p>PPD&#x000a0;affects the&#x000a0;parents and the infant and can lead to a chronic depressive disorder if untreated. Even if treated, PPD can be a risk for future episodes of major depression. Moreover, PPD is a stressful event for the entire family, as children may be affected also. Children of parents who have untreated depression can develop behavioral and emotional problems, including language development delays, which are commonly seen, sleeping problems, eating difficulties, excessive crying, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.</p>
        <p>When untreated, PPD is associated with negative consequences for those who are postpartum,&#x000a0;including disrupted health behaviors, relationships, physiology, and parenting.

        <title>Deterrence and Patient Education</title>
        <p>Deterrence and education are critical components in addressing PPD. Proactive education about PPD should begin during prenatal care, with clinicians informing expectant mothers and their families about the signs, symptoms, and potential risks associated with this condition. By increasing awareness, new mothers can recognize the onset of PPD early and seek timely intervention. Education programs can include prenatal classes, informational brochures, and discussions during regular medical appointments. Additionally, integrating mental health screenings into postpartum checkups can help in early detection and management.</p>
        <p>Support systems, including counseling services and support groups, should be readily accessible to new mothers, providing a safe space for them to share experiences and receive professional guidance. By fostering an environment of understanding and support, the stigma associated with PPD can be mitigated, encouraging more women to seek help. Ultimately, comprehensive deterrence and educational strategies are essential in reducing the incidence and severity of postpartum depression, ensuring healthier outcomes for mothers and their infants.</p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>To enhance patient-centered care, outcomes, patient safety, and team performance related to PPD, an interprofessional approach involving physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and other health professionals is crucial. Due to the high morbidity of PPD, current efforts emphasize prevention. Nurses are in a primary position to identify patients at high risk for postpartum mood disorders even before delivery. During admission, nurses can identify patients with a history of depression or postpartum blues and monitor those who develop depression during pregnancy. These patients require education on available treatments and support from the postpartum nurse or primary care clinician. Coordination with therapists and referrals to psychiatrists for antidepressant treatment may be necessary.</p>
        <p>Pharmacological and nonpharmacological prophylaxis are used with variable success, but evidence shows that postpartum parents who are treated have better bonding experiences with their infants. Additionally, untreated parental depression can lead to mood and behavior problems and obesity in children. Despite awareness, many patients remain untreated due to a lack of follow-up. Therefore, the role of the postpartum visiting nurse is critical in ensuring ongoing support and care. Effective interprofessional communication and care coordination among clinicians are essential in identifying, monitoring, and treating PPD, ultimately improving patient outcomes and safety.</p>
