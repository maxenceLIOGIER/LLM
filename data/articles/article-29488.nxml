        <p>Creating a sterile field is to reduce the number of microbes present to as few as possible. The sterile field is used in many situations outside the operating room as well as inside the operating room when performing surgical cases. Sterile fields should be used outside the operating room when performing any procedure that could introduce microbes into a patient. A few examples would be inserting a Foley catheter, an arterial line, and a central line. Inside the operating room, sterile fields are created when practitioners identify the back table that will be used, the mayo stand that will go up to the field, and finally, the patient and the surgical site itself. This review describes the preparation of a sterile field and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in ensuring antisepsis.</p>

        <title>Technique or Treatment</title>
        <p>Sterile fields should always be established as close as possible to the time of the procedure and should not be left unattended. When a sterile field is opened and exposed for a long time before the procedure, the risk of contaminated items by airborne microbes is higher. If left unattended, the risk is higher, such that someone might have accidentally contaminated the field. These put the patient at risk for a hospital-acquired infection (HAI).</p>
        <p>When creating a sterile field in the operating room, it is important to arrange the furniture before opening supplies because of the spreading of microbes as you move around. The furniture should be 12 to 18 inches from the walls or any objects that could contaminate the field.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29488.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29488.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>Place the back table, ring stand, and mayo stand in their locations before opening items. Before opening any supplies, all packages must be checked to ensure the integrity of the packaging materials. There should not be any holes or tears in the outside wrappers. If the integrity is intact, it is safe to place the back table pack on the back table (this item is always opened first). The back table allows a large surface to open all other supplies onto it during set-up and is the main sterile field. Once the back table cover is opened, it is essential to note that an imaginary 1-inch border exists along the table's edges. This border is considered unsterile and should be avoided when tossing items onto the field; another unsterile area is anything below table height. Once the back table is opened, bend down and move the table closer to the wall by grasping the lower leg of the table. This allows less chance of someone contaminating the table and getting it out of the way.</p>
        <p>The next item is the ring stand that holds the basin sets; open the first flap away from you, then each side flap, and lastly, the flap closest to you. Bend down and marry (move) the ring, stand closer to the back table, and close the space between them. The sterile flap is&#x000a0;against the back sterile table drape.</p>
        <p>Open up sterile supplies needed for the procedure; open peel packs by checking the integrity of the package; identify if there is an indicator in the package and if the indicator has changed color. The indicator only informs us that the items have been exposed to a sterilant. Open wrapped items using the same method used with the basin set; open the flap away from you first, then the sides, and finally, the flap closest to you. When opening peel-packed items, ensure there is an indicator and that it has turned color. Open the peel pack and do not slide any item near the edges of the wrapper; the one-inch border exits for peel-pack items, as previously discussed. When flipping the items into the basin or onto the back table, be careful not to extend your arm over the sterile field.</p>
        <p>To open the instrument trays, ensure there is a plastic lock that identifies an indicator change, a label with the Julian date and load number, and make sure it is the correct set for the procedure. Look at the outside container for moisture or condensation; if there is moisture, do not use it and retrieve another set. If there is no condensation, proceed by grasping the latches and flipping them open, automatically breaking the plastic locks. Lift the lid straight up and step back before flipping the lid over; this ensures that dust or particles&#x000a0;don't fall into the tray. Once you flip the lid over, check for moisture and remove the paper filter. To check the filter for any holes,&#x000a0;lift it toward a light to ensure no pin-size holes. If the filter looks good, carefully look into the pan for an indicator; do not lean over the pan.&#x000a0;If you cannot see an indicator, look more closely after being gowned and gloved. Until you are scrubbed in, the instruments are complete; once you are gowned and gloved, carefully pick up the inside basket and hold it in front of you until the circulating nurse checks the bottom filter and the bottom of the tray for moisture. This is also an excellent time to find the inside indicator. If you cannot find an indicator, do not use the tray. Once the nurse verifies the instrument tray and you see an indicator, you can place the instruments on the back table.</p>
        <p>Finally, open a gown and gloves for yourself on the mayo stand. The gown's wrapper&#x000a0;is a small sterile field to open your gloves and towel. This is&#x000a0;the&#x000a0; first stop after performing your surgical scrub and dry, gown, and glove.</p>
        <p>Once all the necessary items are opened, it is time to complete the next step, the surgical&#x000a0;hand scrub. Hand hygiene is the most essential item you can perform to prevent infections.</p>
        <p>The surgical hand scrub can be accomplished in&#x000a0;1 of&#x000a0;2 ways: the 5-minute scrub or the counted brush stroke method.</p>

<bold>Hand Washing</bold>
</p>
        <p>Hand washing is now considered an event-related practice performed before and after specific tasks. Handwashing should last 15 seconds up to a minute or more if the hands get dirty.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29488.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29488.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29488.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29488.r9">[9]</xref></p>

        <p>Always perform a hand wash before performing a surgical scrub. The surgical&#x000a0;scrub's purpose is to reduce&#x000a0;microbes to the absolute minimum and is always completed right before gowning and gloving or any invasive procedure. It is impossible to sterilize a person's skin, but reducing the number of microbes to a minimum is paramount.</p>
        <p>Before starting the scrub, ensure the scrub top is tucked into the scrub pants, and avoid splashing water on the scrubs. Bacteria can easily harbor in moist environments.</p>

            <p>The forearm is next, and it is divided into&#x000a0;4 planes (planes are from the wrist to&#x000a0;2 inches above the elbow); each plane is scrubbed separately, performed in a circular motion for ten strokes each</p>

Once the arm has passed through the water, raise the arm to the same height as before with hands above the elbow to allow the water to drip down and off the elbow.

        <p>Once the scrub is complete, you cannot touch any nonsterile surface; if you do, you must re-scrub. Proceed to where the gown and gloves were opened by holding arms above the elbows and arms away from scrubs.</p>
