        <p>Eclampsia is a life-threatening complication of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, characterized by the sudden onset of seizures in the absence of other neurological causes. This condition can occur before, during, or after labor&#x02014;with the highest risk within the first postpartum week. While preeclampsia, marked by hypertension and proteinuria, often precedes eclampsia, it may also develop without prior warning signs. Symptoms such as severe headaches, visual disturbances, and altered mental status are common, though eclampsia can manifest suddenly. Immediate management, including seizure control with magnesium sulfate and timely delivery, is critical to preventing maternal and fetal complications.</p>
        <p>This course enhances healthcare professionals' ability to recognize the signs of eclampsia, understand its risk factors, and implement evidence-based interventions for management. Participants learn to coordinate care with an interprofessional team, including obstetricians, anesthesiologists, and critical care specialists, to ensure timely intervention and optimal outcomes. Emphasizing early recognition and collaboration, the course improves patient outcomes by reducing delays in treatment and enhancing maternal and fetal safety during and after eclampsia episodes.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Eclampsia is a severe pregnancy complication characterized by the onset of seizures in patients with hypertensive disorders. Eclampsia typically manifests through new-onset seizures, which can be tonic-clonic, focal, or multifocal; these seizures must occur in the absence of underlying causes such as epilepsy or cerebrovascular events. Eclampsia most frequently develops in the first 48 hours postpartum; however, this condition can arise before, during, or after labor. The highest risk of occurrence is within the first postpartum week.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r1">[1]</xref> In some cases, eclampsia may develop without preceding preeclampsia signs, such as hypertension or proteinuria.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>Eclampsia is a significant cause of maternal mortality. Seizures can lead to severe complications like maternal hypoxia, trauma, and aspiration pneumonia, though long-term neurological damage is rare. Some women may experience lasting cognitive impairments, particularly after recurrent seizures or untreated severe hypertension.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;There is uncertainty&#x000a0;whether the pathophysiology of antepartum eclampsia differs from that of postpartum eclampsia.&#x000a0;In either case, the condition often presents with symptoms like severe headaches, visual disturbances, and altered mental status&#x02014;but it can also occur suddenly and without warning.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Magnesium sulfate is considered the first-line treatment for preventing and controlling seizures in patients with eclampsia, although its use in patients who are pregnant with preeclampsia without severe features is debated. Management involves supportive measures, careful monitoring of magnesium levels to avoid toxicity, especially in women with impaired renal function, and timely fetal delivery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r3">[3]</xref> Additionally, the choice of anesthesia during delivery is crucial, with regional anesthesia generally preferred over general anesthesia due to the lower risk of complications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r2">[2]</xref></p>

        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>Eclampsia, a severe complication of preeclampsia, has multiple underlying causes, with uteroplacental ischemia being the primary mechanism.&#x000a0;Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/27640">Preeclampsia</ext-link>," for more information on preeclampsia. Uteroplacental ischemia involves an inadequate blood supply to the placenta, leading to its infarction and the release of toxic substances into the maternal bloodstream. These substances may trigger seizures, the hallmark of eclampsia. The role of uteroplacental ischemia is supported by various animal models that replicate preeclampsia-like symptoms, including hypertension and proteinuria, through induced reductions in uteroplacental blood flow.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>Other factors contributing to the development of eclampsia include maternal infections and inflammation, such as periodontal disease and urinary tract infections, which have been linked to an increased risk of preeclampsia. Moreover, maternal obesity, gestational diabetes, and metabolic disorders are significant contributors to the development of eclampsia, likely due to the associated systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>Additionally, fetal conditions such as trisomy 13 and mirror syndrome (formerly Ballentyne syndrome), as well as complications from multiple gestations, can precipitate preeclampsia, which may progress to eclampsia if not managed effectively. The premature aging of the placenta and breakdowns in maternal-fetal immune tolerance further exacerbate the risk, indicating a complex interplay of genetic, immunological, and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of eclampsia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r4">[4]</xref></p>

        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>Eclampsia and preeclampsia were once thought to be caused by "toxins" or "poisons" entering the gravida's bloodstream, leading to the term "toxemia of pregnancy."<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r14">[14]</xref>&#x000a0;Despite multiple studies that have posited several underlying mechanisms, the precise pathophysiology of eclampsia remains unclear.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r11">[11]</xref></p>
        <p>Theories that have gained more support involve dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and cerebral blood flow autoregulation. The proposed BBB pathophysiologic mechanism suggests that eclampsia may result from disrupted cerebral blood flow autoregulation, similar to hypertensive encephalopathy. This disruption could cause BBB dysfunction, allowing fluids and proteins to enter brain tissue and potentially leading to seizures. The BBB, formed by endothelial cells in the capillaries, regulates the passage of molecules between the blood and the brain. Typically, the BBB maintains a stable environment for neural function by selectively allowing substances to cross and using specific ion channels and transporters to optimize conditions for synaptic signaling. Autoregulation in the cerebral circulation adjusts blood flow in response to changes in blood pressure, with vasoconstriction occurring at high pressures and vasodilation at low pressures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r11">[11]</xref></p>
        <p>Another proposed hypothesis is that elevated blood pressure from preeclampsia causes dysfunction of autoregulation of the cerebral vasculature, which causes hypoperfusion, endothelial damage, or edema.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r15">[15]</xref>&#x000a0;During pregnancy, the body adapts to increased plasma volume, requiring adjustments in cerebral circulation to maintain consistent blood flow. Failure in these adaptations may increase BBB permeability, resulting in vasogenic edema, neuroinflammation, and neuronal injury. Autoregulation dysfunction may lead to acute hypertension, increasing hydrostatic pressure, reducing cerebral vascular resistance, and potentially damaging microvessels, ultimately resulting in cerebral edema and eclampsia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;However, the observance of eclampsia in women without severe hypertension before seizures indicates that this is not the only underlying mechanism.</p>
        <p>Other proposed mechanisms include the impact of circulating factors in preeclampsia,&#x000a0;such as vascular endothelial growth factor and oxidized low-density lipoprotein, which may exacerbate BBB dysfunction through oxidative stress and inflammation. Additionally, theories involving cerebral vasospasm and overregulation have been proposed, though studies indicate that overperfusion, rather than vasospasm, might be more relevant to the onset of eclamptic seizures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r11">[11]</xref></p>

        <title>Histopathology</title>
        <p>Autopsy findings in eclampsia often reveal significant gross cerebral pathology, including extensive brain swelling, white matter hemorrhages, and tissue necrosis. Histologic findings observed in patients with eclampsia include perivascular edema, hemorrhage, hemosiderin deposits, small vessel thrombosis, and parenchymal necrosis. However, these histopathologic characteristics are not diagnostic of eclampsia, as they are also associated with other conditions involving systemic endothelial damage, such as atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, hypertensive urgency or emergency, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r11">[11]</xref></p>

        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>The classic presentation of eclampsia is generalized tonic-clonic seizures with no other underlying cause in a&#x000a0;patient with a hypertensive pregnancy disorder. Generally, most professional societies use a blood pressure of 140/90 mm&#x02009;Hg or higher as the threshold for hypertension during pregnancy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r7">[7]</xref> Additionally, eclampsia may be preceded by various symptoms, including visual disturbances, severe headaches, and epigastric pain, though these symptoms do not reliably predict its occurrence. Common visual changes include blurred vision, double vision, scotomata, flashes of light, and transient cortical blindness. Several studies have reported the most frequent symptoms associated with eclampsia were headaches, visual disturbances, and upper abdominal or epigastric pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>While hypertension often accompanies eclampsia and is considered a distinguishing feature of the condition, it is not always present; some patients may develop eclampsia without severe blood pressure elevation. Conversely, not all patients with preeclampsia with severe features develop eclampsia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r10">[10]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;Moreover, proteinuria, a standard marker of preeclampsia, may also be absent in some cases of eclampsia. Therefore, the clinical characteristics of eclampsia are not dependable indicators. Additionally, the absence of severe preeclampsia features in some patients with eclampsia challenges the common belief that preeclampsia will always worsen over time, eventually progressing to eclampsia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Clinicians should be careful to consider differential diagnoses, including posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, that present similarly to eclampsia and require careful management, including blood pressure control and long-term follow-up.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/78063">Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome</ext-link>," for more information on this condition.</p>
        <p>Eclamptic seizures can occur before, during, or after delivery, with a significant number occurring during the antepartum period. Postpartum eclampsia, particularly late-onset eclampsia, defined as seizures occurring more than 48 hours after delivery, can still pose a significant risk. A large portion of these seizures occurs in the first 7 to 10 days postpartum, often presenting with neurological symptoms, including headache. Postpartum headaches should be carefully evaluated, especially if accompanied by altered mental status, seizures, or visual disturbances, to rule out other severe conditions such as cerebral venous thrombosis or reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r1">[11]</xref></p>

        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>Eclampsia is typically the condition initially suspected in patients presenting with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, especially those individuals with a history of hypertensive pregnancy disorder. Evaluating eclampsia primarily involves assessing various aspects of maternal and fetal health due to the condition&#x02019;s potential impact on multiple organs and the exclusion of differential diagnoses. Because of the urgent nature of eclampsia, this evaluation is conducted alongside emergent therapeutic interventions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r10">[10]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r11">[11]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r16">[16]</xref></p>
        <p>The evaluation for eclampsia is centered around the diagnosis of preeclampsia as it is a known life-threatening complication of this disease process. In addition to serial maternal blood pressure measurements and continuous fetal monitoring, diagnostic studies should be performed to assess for indications of end-organ dysfunction, including proteinuria, renal dysfunction, liver dysfunction, central nervous system symptoms, pulmonary edema, and thrombocytopenia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r10">[10]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r11">[11]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r16">[16]</xref></p>

<bold>Laboratory Studies</bold>
</p>
        <p>Key laboratory studies include liver function panels, platelet counts, and complete metabolic profiles to assess kidney function as performed for preeclampsia and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome. Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22684">HELLP syndrome</ext-link>," for more information on diagnostic laboratory studies.&#x000a0;Proteinuria,&#x000a0;defined as 300 mg or more of protein in a 24-hour urine sample or a urinary protein/creatinine ratio of 0.3 or greater, is no longer essential for diagnosing preeclampsia and may be absent before the onset of seizure activity; this laboratory test is still included during evaluation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r17">[17]</xref></p>
        <p>Other essential laboratory studies include a hepatic panel to assess liver function, a complete blood count to quantify platelet counts, and a basic metabolic profile to assess kidney function. Platelet levels of 100,000/&#x003bc;L or less and liver transaminase levels more than 2 times the upper limit of normal with or without right upper quadrant or epigastric pain are also associated with preeclampsia with severe features. Laboratory tests to exclude differential diagnoses for seizures should also be considered, including urine drug screens, complete metabolic panels, or toxicology screens. Brain natriuretic peptide testing can help confirm the diagnosis and guide management, as it correlates well with heart function and fluid levels in cases where fluid overload is suspected.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r11">[11]</xref></p>

        <p>Patients diagnosed with hypertension or preeclampsia during pregnancy, as well as their family members, need to be educated on the signs and symptoms of eclampsia. They must be instructed to call emergency services immediately and bring the patient to the hospital as soon as possible.

<bold>Eclampsia Prevention</bold>
</p>
        <p>Primary and secondary preventative strategies have been recommended to decrease the occurrence of eclampsia. Low-dose aspirin&#x000a0;(60 to 150 mg daily) is a primary prevention of eclampsia, focused on stopping the disease before it starts. This intervention has been shown to reduce the risk of preeclampsia by 10% to 15%. Secondary prevention consists of early disease detection and mitigation of adverse events. Strategies for the secondary prevention of eclampsia include weekly monitoring of&#x000a0;patients&#x000a0;with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, including blood pressure measurements, laboratory studies, fetal growth measurements, blood pressure regulation, timely delivery, and magnesium sulfate seizure prophylaxis.&#x000a0;Magnesium sulfate is also utilized to prevent recurrent seizures and reduce the risk of maternal death. While the exact mechanisms of magnesium sulfate are unclear, it is believed to work by acting as a vasodilator, protecting the blood-brain barrier, reducing cerebral edema, and functioning as a central anticonvulsant.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27632.r11">[11]</xref></p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>Eclampsia is a severe medical condition that demands swift diagnosis and intervention to minimize risks for the mother and the unborn child. Effective management of eclampsia requires the coordinated efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team, with each member playing a critical role. Clinicians and advanced clinicians must recognize and promptly address the signs of eclampsia, particularly in emergency settings where rapid intervention is crucial, especially during active seizures. Nurses are responsible for closely monitoring patients and promptly relaying any changes in the patient&#x02019;s condition to clinicians, ensuring that timely interventions (eg, administering anticonvulsant medication) are initiated. Communication between emergency clinicians and obstetricians is also essential, particularly when emergent delivery is necessary to manage the condition and safeguard maternal and fetal health.</p>
        <p>Pharmacists contribute by reviewing and verifying medication dosages, ensuring no dangerous drug interactions, and collaborating with clinicians to adjust treatments. Seamless communication across all healthcare professionals&#x02014;including nurses, clinicians, pharmacists, and other support staff&#x02014;is fundamental to ensuring patient safety and enhancing outcomes. In this patient-centered approach, all care team members must remain focused on the well-being of both the mother and child, providing coordinated, efficient care that leads to better overall team performance and patient outcomes in cases of eclampsia.</p>
