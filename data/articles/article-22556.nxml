        <title>Indications</title>
        <p>Motor strength and sensory testing will distinguish lesions and appropriate indications for correction according to above categories. &#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22556.r3">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22556.r4">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22556.r5">[6]</xref></p>
        <p>Wrist passive tenodesis test should be performed by taking the wrist passively from flexion to extension.&#x000a0;With a normal test, the digits transition from an extended posture in wrist flexion to a flexed posture in wrist extension with fingers maintaining symmetrical cascade. An abnormal exam can indicate isolated tendon injuries. Wrist, hand, and finger range of motion testing is important since the full passive range of motion should be achieved before tendon transfers.</p>
        <p>Ulnar claw hand occurs because of unopposed extension forces by the EDC and EDM on the small and ring finger MP joints with no counter flexion force by the interossei and ulnar two lumbricals innervated by the ulnar nerve. The extended posture of the MP joint prevents extension forces from the EDC from being transmitted to the PIP and DIP joints. Also, the normal extensor force to the PIP and DIP joints through the extensor hood of the ring and small fingers is deficient secondary to weakness of the interossei and ulnar two lumbricals.</p>
        <p>A low ulnar nerve palsy results in a more severe claw hand because the FDP to the ring and small fingers are intact, worsening the imbalance of flexion forces across the PIP and DIP joints.</p>
        <p>In ulnar nerve palsy, when the patient attempts to pinch an object, the thumb MP hyperextended the, and the IP flexes in an attempt by the EPL and FPL respectively to compensate for the deficiency of the adductor pollicis, 1st dorsal interosseus, and deep head of the flexor pollicis brevis (FPB).&#x000a0;This is called Froment sign.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>In the setting a non-displaced distal radius fracture, integrity of the EPL can be tested by having the patient place their hand flat on a table, inability to lift their thumb off of the table is consistent with an EPL rupture.</p>
        <p>An EMG can help determine nerve injury severity and likelihood of recovery. &#x000a0;Unlike procedures to reinnervate muscles, tendon transfers do not depend on the viability of the motor endplate of the dysfunctional muscle and so can be performed at any time.</p>

            <p>Clawing is corrected by blocking MCP hyperextension which allows for the transmission of the EDC extensor forces distally to the PIP and IP through the extensor hood.&#x000a0; This is accomplished by MCP capsulodesis or tenodesis. The FDS slips of the affected finger can be transected 2 cm proximal to their insertion and sutured back to themselves proximally creating a lasso around the A1 pulley (Zancolli lasso). Alternatively, the FDS of the long finger can be transected 2 cm proximal to its insertion and retracted from the tendon sheath proximally and then rerouted distally deep to the intermetacarpal ligament and inserted into the radial lateral bands of the small and ring fingers (Stiles-Bunnell). Clawing of all four digits (as seen in a combined ulnar and low median nerve palsy) can be treated using the FCR, or ECRB tendon split into two to four tails according to the number of fingers being addressed. The tails are then extended using free tendon grafts and attached to the radial lateral bands of the small, ring and long fingers and the ulnar lateral band of the index finger (Brand).</p>

            <p>Power pinch (normally achieved by the ulnarly innervated adductor pollicis, 1st dorsal interossei, and deep head of the flexor pollicis brevis) can be addressed using the ECRB or FDS for an adductor plasty. The ECRB adductor-plasty is performed by detaching the ECRB from its insertion on the base of the second metacarpal and retrieving it proximal to the extensor retinaculum. A free tendon graft is then used as an extension on the end of the ECRB tendon and routed distally between the second and third metacarpals and attached to the adductor pollicis insertion on the first metacarpal. Alternatively, FDS adductor-plasty can be done using the long finger FDS. The FDS is harvested 2 cm proximal to its insertion and routed across the palm and attached to the adductor pollicis insertion.</p>

        <p>EPL Rupture in the setting of a healed distal radius fracture is treated with EIP to EPL transfer. &#x000a0;When harvesting the EIP, it can be identified ulnar to the index EDC tendon at the level of the metacarpal head.</p>

        <p>Donor tendons are attached to recipient tendons most commonly using the Pulvertaft weave.&#x000a0;Utilizing this method, the&#x000a0;donor tendon is woven back and forth through the substance of the recipient's tendon with each pass 90 degrees perpendicular to the previous pass and fixed to the tendon using a mattress suture of 2-0 or 3-0 ticron or fiberwire depending on surgeon preference and the size of the tendon. A minimum of three passes should be used for appropriate strength.</p>
        <p>Complications are related mainly to an improper initial graft tensioning and repair site rupture or loosening as a result of slit propagation or knot failure. Alternative repair techniques (spiral linking and loop-tendon suture) can be used based on surgeon preference to help improve the biomechanical strength of the repair site with the tradeoff of increased bulk of the repair.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22556.r6">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22556.r8">[9]</xref></p>

        <p>In the forearm and hand there are over forty different muscles many of which perform overlapping functions. After an injury, some muscles may not move correctly. A tendon transfer moves a working muscle and tendon to replace a non-working muscle and tendon improving function.</p>

        <p>Functional deficits in the hand arise most commonly as sequelae of radial, median, or ulnar nerve injury, but can also be secondary to brachial plexus injury, spinal cord injury, specific muscle or tendon injury, or as a result of polio. Additionally, non-displaced distal radius fractures treated non-operatively can lead to attritional rupture of the extensor pollicis longus. Tendon transfers are used to address functional deficits created by these conditions.</p>
