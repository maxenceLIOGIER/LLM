        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) describes a transient airway narrowing occurring during physical exertion. The name EIB is favored over exercise-induced asthma (EIA) as recommended by the American Thoracic Society (ATS), and American Academy/College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology. EIB can also be denoted as EIB with asthma (EIBa), and EIB without asthma, (EIBwa).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;It is caused by an acute large increase in the amount of air entering the airways that require heating and humidifying. In susceptible individuals, this results in inflammatory, neuronal, and vascular changes ultimately resulting in contraction of the bronchial smooth muscle and symptoms of dyspnea, cough, chest tightness, mucus production, and wheezing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r6">[6]</xref></p>

        <p>EIB occurrence is dependent on what sport is played. High-risk sports include long episodes of exercise greater than 5 to 8 minutes in certain environments such as cold, dry air or chlorinated pools such as long-distance running, cycling, cross country or downhill skiing, ice hockey, ice skating, high altitude sports, swimming, water polo, and triathlons. Medium risk sports include soccer, rugby, football, basketball, volleyball, baseball, cricket, and field hockey, where athletes rarely perform more than 5 to 8 minutes of continuous exercise. Low-risk sports include non-long distance track events inducing sprints, tennis, fencing, gymnastics, boxing, golf, weightlifting, bodybuilding, and martial arts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r2">[2]</xref></p>

        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction results from the alteration of normal lung physiology occurring with evaporative water loss, thermal changes, and irritant exposure induced by a large increase in minute ventilation and demand on the respiratory system to heat and humidify air with exercise-related hyperpnea.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r10">[10]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Ventilation increases by 200 L/min, and airway cooling with mucosal dehydration occur. As cells are dehydrated, there is an increase in osmolality, and the cells shrink in size, leading to an increase in cough, mucus, and loss of the physical barrier function of the epithelium.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;Decreased osmolality and increased electrolyte concentrations are thought to cause a regulatory increase in cell volume pulling fluid from the submucosal layer resulting in edema and release of inflammatory mediators, including histamine, leukotrienes, cysteine, tryptase, prostaglandins and mast cell degranulation. Bronchial blood flow is increased.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r10">[10]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;Reactive oxygen species are generated with increased lipid peroxidation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Sensory and autonomic nerves are activated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The results are direct and neuronal activation of bronchoconstriction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r10">[10]</xref></p>
        <p>Also, nasal breathing becomes insufficient, leading to mouth breathing and increased exposure of lung surfaces to pollutants, irritants, and allergens, which result in the generation of reactive oxygen species and a neutrophilic inflammatory response.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;Some research shows people genetically unable to counteract oxidative stress with glutathione may have an increased risk of EIB.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r11">[11]</xref></p>

        <p>Long term exposure can lead to epithelial damage and shedding, with remodeling and inflammation resembling asthma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;The process is partially reversible as studies have shown the lung damage and hyperresponsiveness improves over weeks to years when exposure and exercise are stopped.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>The osmotic theory is supported by evidence that EIB severity is directly related to the rate of water loss in the airways, EIB can be prevented by inhaling fully humidified air at body temperature, and bronchoconstriction can also be induced by inhalation of hyperosmolar saline.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;Studies have shown an increased number of epithelial cells in sputum samples and elevated exhaled nitric oxide indicative of increased airway inflammation, damage, and shedding in those with EIB.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Exposure to foreign substances as a contributor to EIB is supported by evidence that pollutants such as fossil fuels and ozone contribute to EIB in environments such as ice rinks or practice fields close to major roadways.

        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>Symptoms of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction can include mild to moderate symptoms of chest tightness, wheezing, coughing, and dyspnea that occurs within 15 minutes after 5 to 8 minutes of high-intensity aerobic training.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Reports of severe symptoms with respiratory failure and death occur rarely. Symptoms may occur more often in specific environments with cold, dry air or high concentration of respiratory irritants. Symptoms usually resolve spontaneously within 30 to 90 minutes and induce a refractory period of 1 to 3 hours, where continued exercise does not produce bronchoconstriction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Patients may also be asymptomatic, and therefore EIB may be underdiagnosed.</p>
        <p>Risk factors include a personal or family history of asthma, a personal history of atopy or allergic rhinitis, exposure to cigarette smoke, participating in high-risk sports (see epidemiology), living and practicing in areas with high levels of pollution, and female gender. Some small studies suggest sugar-sweetened beverages may increase risk by increasing inflammation and adiposity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r13">[13]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r11">[11]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-17925.s7" sec-type="Evaluation">
        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>Clinical diagnosis by symptoms has low sensitivity and specificity, and some patients are asymptomatic. Standardized testing for diagnosis includes direct and indirect methods and usually involves spirometry measurement of FEV1 changes from baseline expressed as a percent decrease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r14">[14]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>Direct stimulation of smooth muscle receptors by methacholine to induce bronchoconstriction is well established. Sensitivity at predicting EIB has been reported to be 58.6% to 91.1%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r14">[14]</xref></p>
        <p>Indirect testing, which is more specific for EIB, can involve aerobic exercise in a controlled environment with cold, dry air as these conditions are known to precipitate EIB in susceptible individuals. Alternatives to exercise testing include eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea or hyperventilation of dry air, and airway provocation testing, including hyperosmolar 4.5% saline or dry powder mannitol, which act to dehydrate the respiratory epithelium to induce EIB. The sensitivity and specificity of the alternatives are not well established and may vary by the lab.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r14">[14]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r6">[6]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Exercise Challenge Testing</bold>
</p>
        <p>The ATS recommends exercise challenge testing in a controlled dry environment. Exercise testing parameters outlined by the ATS include recommendations on ventilation level, heart rate, time at maximal capacity, and medications to hold before testing, including caffeine. The patient must avoid entering the refractory period before exercise testing. Serial measurements of spirometry, specifically FEV1, are recorded during exercise at 5,10,15, and 30 minutes. FEV1 has good repeatability and is recommended by ATS to diagnose EIB.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;A fall in FEV1 of greater than or equal to 10% is diagnostic for EIB, with mild at 10% to less than 25%, moderate at 25% to less than 50%, and severe at 50% or greater.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Some labs use 15% as the minimum reduction for diagnosis as it is more specific. Some patients may require multiple exercise sessions to confirm the diagnosis as the reproducibility is 76%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Pulmonary Function Testing</bold>
</p>
        <p>CHEST guidelines provide 2B recommendation for pulmonary function tests (PFT), exercise or bronchoprovocation studies as described above, and allergy testing for common airborne allergens to distinguish between the most common causes of exercise-induced cough.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Fractional Excretion of Nitric Oxide (FENO) Testing</bold>
</p>
        <p>A few smaller studies suggest fractional excretion of nitric oxide (FENO) may replace FEV1 to diagnose and measure the severity of EIB instead of spirometry with FEV1 percent change. The FENO can be used with direct or indirect testing and can be easily performed by younger children. FENO measures the T helper cell type 2 (Th2) inflammatory response, versus airway hyperresponsiveness, and may be better suited to distinguish EIB from another etiology of symptoms. Cut off values of 27 to 46 ppb FENO have been suggested as diagnostic, with greater than 46 ppb being 100% specific.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r15">[15]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r16">[16]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r17">[17]</xref></p>

        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>
<bold>Short-Acting Beta Agonists (SABA)</bold>
</p>
        <p>American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines from 2013 provide a strong recommendation with high-quality evidence for short-acting beta 2 agonists (SABA) use 5 to 20 minutes (optimally 15) minutes before exercise.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The bronchodilation is of rapid onset and can last 2 to 4 hours. Tolerance can develop with frequent SABA use and is likely due to the downregulation of the beta 2 receptors. SABA's are the preferred first-line treatment and have limited side effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r18">[18]</xref>&#x000a0;Mechanism of action is through relaxation of the airway smooth muscles and inhibition of mast cell degranulation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r19">[19]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS)</bold>
</p>
        <p>If symptoms are not well controlled with the SABA or patient is using SABA daily, additional medications can be added after medication adherence, and proper use has been confirmed. It is estimated that 15% to 20% of the patients will not respond to SABA treatment. ATS provides a strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence for daily inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r18">[18]</xref>&#x000a0;ICS may take 2 to 4 weeks for the maximal benefit. ICS appears to be more effective in patients with underlying asthma and are dose-dependent. ICS is not effective when used intermittently before exercise.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;ICS has multiple well-studied benefits in patients with asthma, including a reduction in mortality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r18">[18]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists (LTRA)</bold>
</p>
        <p>ATS provides a strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence for daily leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) to address the inflammatory mediator release involved in EIB.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r18">[18]</xref>&#x000a0;LTRAs may take 2-4 weeks for the maximal benefit.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;LTRAs, including montelukast, zafirlukast, and zileuton, provide longer-lasting bronchodilation and are not associated with tolerance. The effect on FEV1 reduction is less than with ICS or SABA. The choice between adding ICS of LTRA is patient-specific.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Mast Cell Stabilizing Agents (MCSA)</bold>
</p>
        <p>ATS also makes strong recommendations with high-quality evidence for adding mast cell stabilizer (MCSA) before exercise. Mast cell degranulation plays a key role in EIB pathology. There is no additional benefit when MCSA is combined with SABA, and MCSAs are less effective than SABA. MCSA is not widely available in the U.S.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Short-acting Muscarinic Antagonists (SAMA)</bold>

        <p>Nonpharmacologic treatment approaches are strongly recommended with moderate-quality evidence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The first is to induce a refractory period by performing 10 to 15 minutes of vigorous activity, decreasing EIB for the next 2 hours.

        <p>Secondly, masks to promote warming and humidification of the air with exercise are weakly recommended with low-quality evidence and may be as effective as using a SABA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r20">[20]</xref>&#x000a0;The severity of bronchoconstriction is related to the humidity of the air inhaled, and new heat and moisture exchanger masks may reduce the severity and SABA use.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r20">[20]</xref></p>
        <p>Thirdly, wearing a mechanical barrier mask and/or avoiding exercise in environments high in pollen, allergens, ozone, exhaust, and high levels of chlorine can reduce EIB.

<bold>Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)&#x000a0;</bold>
</p>
        <p>Treatment with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) support has been shown to decrease airway reactivity in children with asthma and was evaluated in combination with respiratory physical therapy in one study for EIB in asthmatics with positive results in a Brazilian study. The benefit of NIPPV was postulated to involve the stretch mechanism in airways and with the resulting induction of an inhibitory pathway that stopped the cycle of inflammation and promoted bronchodilation. Participants completed 10 1-hr sessions twice a week. The first 20 minutes were spent completing respiratory exercises while sitting and supine, followed by either continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at 8 cmH2O, inspiratory muscle training, or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) at 8/12 cm H2O. Results included exercise FEV1 measurements as outlined by ATS, FENO to measure airway inflammation, and a questionnaire for symptom measurement. PPV both bilevel and CPAP reduced EIB. Respiratory muscle training (RMT) was shown in the same study to reduce medication use and increase respiratory muscle strength.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;This recent study offers additional nonpharmacologic options for the treatment of EIB.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Treatment to reduce the perception of symptoms</bold>
</p>
        <p>Another treatment approach involves reducing the perception of symptoms. Breathing control, including yoga, or supervised breathing training, has been shown in some small studies to decrease symptoms, reduce medication use, decrease anxiety and depression associated with EIB, and increase the quality of life. Further research and adaptation for use during EIB events are needed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r20">[20]</xref>&#x000a0;Respiratory muscle training involves first ensuring proper breathing technique and then using a device to increase inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength. A Cochrane review of a small number of studies reported no evidence for or against respiratory muscle training. It has shown promise with COPD, exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction (EILO), and stridor and offers an additional inexpensive treatment for EIB.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r20">[20]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r21">[21]</xref></p>

        <p>It is important to consider the anti-doping regulations present in many athletic programs. Some medications utilized for Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction may require a therapeutic use exemption (TUE). ICS, LTRA's, MCSA's, inhaled anticholinergics, SABA (including albuterol and formoterol), antibiotics, 1st generation antihistamines with or without oral decongestant, nasal ipratropium, dextromethorphan, nasal corticosteroids, topical decongestants, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in appropriate doses do not enhance performance and therefore do not require a TUE.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Oral steroids and terbutaline are banned and require TUE.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17925.r4">[4]</xref></p>

        <p>Care coordination between primary care providers, pulmonologists, ENT, sports medicine practitioners, and coaches is required to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment of Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. Sports coaches play an important role in identifying athletes who are experiencing symptoms during the practice or who express a desire to quit the sport due to poor fitness, as it can be a sign of EIB. The education of coaches is important to ensure adherence to face protection from cold, dry air, exposure to pollutants, particulate matter, and allergens during practice. Coaches can also work with school administration to ensure practice locations and pool chemicals are safe for practice. Primary care sports medicine practitioners may be the first contact for athletes with symptoms. Proper testing for diagnosis is required as clinical symptoms are not sensitive or specific, and some patients are asymptomatic. Differential diagnosis includes the entire airway, and each part may contribute to symptoms requiring referral to an otolaryngologist. Coordination with pulmonology for testing may be required. Pulmonology may already be involved in asthma management in hard to control patients. Communication and coordination will lead to an optimal diagnosis, treatment, treatment adherence, and control of bronchoconstriction, allowing patients to participate in an activity as they desire.</p>
