        <p>Cauda equina and conus medullaris syndromes have overlap in anatomy and clinical presentation. The cauda equina is a group of nerves and nerve roots stemming from the distal end of the spinal cord, typically levels L1-L5 and contains axons of nerves that give both motor and sensory innervation to the legs, bladder, anus, and perineum. Cauda equina syndrome (CES) results from compression and disruption of the function of these nerves and can be inclusive of the conus medullaris or distal to it, and most often occurs when damage occurs to the L3-L5 nerve roots.

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Cauda equina and conus medullaris syndromes have overlap in anatomy and clinical presentation. Therefore, for the purpose of&#x000a0;this discussion, they will be grouped, and notable differences highlighted. The conus medullaris is the terminal end of the spinal cord, which typically occurs at the L1 vertebral level in the average adult.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19025.r1">[1]</xref> Conus medullaris syndrome (CMS) results when there is compressive damage to the spinal cord from T12-L2.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19025.r1">[1]</xref> The cauda equina is a group of nerves and nerve roots stemming from the distal end of the spinal cord, typically levels L1-L5 and contains axons of nerves that give both motor and sensory innervation to the legs, bladder, anus, and perineum.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19025.r2">[2]</xref> Cauda equina syndrome (CES) results from compression and disruption of the function of these nerves and can be inclusive of the conus medullaris or distal to it, and most often occurs when damage occurs to the L3-L5 nerve roots.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19025.r1">[1]</xref> Both syndromes are neurosurgical emergencies as they can present with back pain radiating to the legs, motor and sensory dysfunction of the lower extremities, bladder and/or bowel dysfunction, sexual dysfunction and saddle anesthesia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19025.r3">[3]</xref> CMS and CES also carry a high risk of litigation as delays in diagnosis and management can lead to devastating life-long impairment.</p>

        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>Cauda equina syndrome and conus medullaris syndrome result from compression of the spinal cord and nerves/nerve roots arising from L1-L5 levels. The most common cause of compression in 45% of CES is a herniated lumbar intervertebral disc.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19025.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0; Other causes include epidural abscess, spinal epidural hematoma, diskitis, tumor (either metastatic or a primary CNS cancer), trauma (particularly when there is retropulsion of bone fracture fragments), spinal stenosis and aortic obstruction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19025.r4">[4]</xref> Rare reported cases exist in which CES was associated with chiropractic manipulation, placement of interspinous devices, and thrombosis of the inferior vena cava.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19025.r4">[4]</xref></p>

        <p>The symptoms above when presenting in isolation, are neither specific nor sensitive for CMS/CES. However, several of the signs and symptoms mentioned above taken as a constellation should raise clinical suspicion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19025.r2">[2]</xref> These symptoms also lack significant positive predictive value for the syndromes, especially early on.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19025.r6">[6]</xref> However, the onset of perineal anesthesia associated with bladder dysfunction is typical of the start of CES and the time at which the clock starts on diagnosis and management.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19025.r2">[2]</xref> It is important also to note that painless urinary retention often has the greatest predictive value as a stand-alone symptom, but it is unfortunately indicative of late, often irreversible CMS/CES.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19025.r7">[7]</xref></p>

        <title>Prognosis</title>
        <p>Several studies have looked at prognosis and outcomes based on the timing of surgical decompression. Early intervention by surgical decompression in patients with conus medullaris and cauda equina syndromes is associated with a better&#x000a0;prognosis, particularly when surgery occurs within 48 hours of initial presentation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19025.r6">[6]</xref> The longer the compression continues, the worse the permanent structural and functional impairment, and the poorer the prognosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19025.r2">[2]</xref> It is important to note that the presence of&#x000a0;bladder dysfunction prior to surgery has been linked to poorer outcomes regardless of the timing of decompression, although early decompression is still the recommendation for a better prognosis irrespective of clinical status at initial presentation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19025.r2">[2]</xref></p>

        <title>Complications</title>
        <p>Complications in cauda equina syndrome and conus medullaris syndrome occur in a large percentage of those diagnosed. One study looked at 63-day outcomes on micturition, defecation, saddle anesthesia, sexual function, and sciatica in cauda equina syndrome. The data indicate that a large percentage of patients still experience residual symptoms irrespective of their time to surgical decompression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19025.r3">[3]</xref> Micturition deficits such as retention requiring self-catheterization or presence of suprapubic or indwelling catheters and incontinence still presented in 47.7% of patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19025.r3">[3]</xref> Dysfunction with defecation decreased post-operatively significantly, but 41.8% of patients still had problems at 63 days post-operatively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19025.r3">[3]</xref> Sexual dysfunction persisted in 53.3% of patients, and saddle anesthesia in 56.6%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19025.r3">[3]</xref> Sciatica was present in 47.5% of patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19025.r3">[3]</xref> The best predictors of outcome are neurological status at presentation and degree of&#x000a0;injury.

        <title>Deterrence and Patient Education</title>
        <p>Patients presenting with sciatica and no other evidence of CES/CMS in the history or exam should receive counsel on the possible development of other related symptoms such as bladder or bowel dysfunction, impotence, and saddle anesthesia. These patients must be given strict return precautions in the event they develop other symptoms pointing to CES/CMS. Patients who are suspected to have CES/CMS and are undergoing evaluation for these syndromes need to remain informed and updated on their investigations (MRI, bladder scan, etc.) and pending surgical consultations. Patients who receive a definitive diagnosis need counseling on complication rates and must receive a realistic prognosis based on their degree of&#x000a0;injury. Due to the nature of&#x000a0;sensitive lifelong sequelae resulting from these syndromes, cases with CES/CMS have a high involvement in medicolegal litigation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19025.r8">[8]</xref> For physicians, it is vital to document the history and physical exam thoroughly and accurately and reach the diagnosis as promptly as possible. In court cases involving CES, a positive association exists between time to surgical decompression greater than 48 hours and an adverse decision for the physician involved.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19025.r8">[8]</xref> The degree of functional loss did not affect court rulings in the cases studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19025.r8">[8]</xref></p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>The involvement and effective collaboration of the entire healthcare team is essential in any patient encounter, but even more so in cases&#x000a0;where the presentation requires urgency in proper diagnosis and management. Due to the high degree of functional impairment arising from CES/CMS, speedy diagnosis and subsequent treatment via surgical decompression are important. The efficiency of the medical system must begin with the person responsible for triaging appropriately in the emergency department, where a significant proportion of patients with CES/CMS initially present for evaluation. After the initial triage, nurses and physicians must work together to&#x000a0;keep the patient updated on the suspected diagnosis, workup, and test results. The radiologist must know the reason for ordering the MRI these patients and given the clinical history and suspected diagnosis early.</p>
        <p>MRI imaging is considered the gold standard imaging modality to asses of CES/CMS, Class I evidence. Many studies recommend obtaining MRI within an hour from presentation. Furthermore, it is paramount that prompt neurosurgical consultation take palce promptly, as surgical decompression is required. Many studies have been done that show decompression within 48 hours is best, although some studies recommend the timing be closer to under 24 hours, Class II evidence. It is challenging to design large RCTs to&#x000a0;obtain Class I evidence for the timing of surgical decompression for obvious ethical reasons.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19025.r9">[9]</xref> Despite prompt surgical intervention, patients will experience residual symptoms. It is vital to counsel patients on this possibility. The primary care provider also has a vital role in further outpatient management postoperatively.</p>
