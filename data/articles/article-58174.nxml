        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee is a debilitating condition characterized by the sudden onset of knee pain and functional impairment, primarily affecting the medial subchondral bone of the femoral condyles (see <bold>Image</bold>. Osteonecrosis of the Knee). Ahlb&#x000e4;ck first described the condition in 1968, highlighting its hallmark features of a nontraumatic origin and rapid progression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Unlike secondary or post-arthroscopic osteonecrosis, no definitive consensus exists concerning the condition's etiology.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;However, if left untreated, it can progress to subchondral collapse and secondary osteoarthritis, thereby necessitating surgical intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>Given the nonspecific and insidious onset, diagnosing and treating spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee can be challenging. Understanding the anatomy of the knee joint is crucial, as the disease mainly impacts the medial femoral condyle, which bears significant weight-bearing stress and may contribute to its development. In contrast, the involvement of the lateral femoral condyle and the tibial plateau is less common.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The natural history of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee typically follows a pattern of sudden symptom onset without a preceding injury, followed by rapid joint deterioration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;Distinctive crescent-shaped osteonecrosis lesions also characterize this condition, and the&#x000a0;progression is influenced by various factors, including the size and location of the lesion and the patient's overall health status.&#x000a0;The speed and pattern of spread vary, with some patients experiencing a slow progression while others face rapid joint destruction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;Some instances of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee are self-limiting,&#x000a0;with symptoms resolving spontaneously over time.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;However, in many patients, the disease progresses, often resulting in sudden, intense knee pain, swelling, functional impairment, and the risk of joint deterioration. Early stages are marked by severe pain and swelling, progressing to joint space narrowing and osteoarthritic changes.&#x000a0;In advanced cases, the necrotic bone may collapse, leading to severe osteoarthritis&#x000a0;requiring joint replacement surgery.&#x000a0;</p>

        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>The exact etiology of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee remains unclear due to the condition's complex and multifactorial nature. This presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge due to its nonspecific symptoms and gradual onset. Various theories have been proposed, each contributing to our understanding of its pathogenesis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;The condition predominantly affects older individuals, hinting at a degenerative component. Key hypotheses for its development include subchondral insufficiency fractures in osteoporotic bones, venous congestion, and localized trauma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee can be distinguished from secondary osteonecrosis by its insidious onset and lack of identifiable cause.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Unlike other types of osteonecrosis, spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee is not commonly associated with systemic risk factors such as corticosteroid use or alcohol abuse,&#x000a0;which suggests a more localized disease mechanism. Earlier theories suggested vascular impairment as the primary cause of the condition, leading to bone necrosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;However, histopathologic analysis and similarities to subchondral insufficiency fractures of the femoral head have prompted the proposal that the primary etiology of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee is a subchondral insufficiency fracture, resulting in localized osteonecrosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r10">[10]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;These&#x000a0;subchondral bone microfractures are believed to initiate a cascade of events, including bone marrow edema, increased intraosseous pressure, and compromised vascular supply, ultimately leading to subchondral plate collapse and subsequent bone necrosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r12">[12]</xref> Additionally, biomechanical factors such as altered load distribution and joint alignment exacerbate subchondral bone stress, particularly in individuals with preexisting joint line abnormalities or those involved in activities that increase knee stress.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r13">[13]</xref></p>
        <p>In 2019, a systematic review by Hussain et al examined the proposed etiologies of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee and found a strong association between meniscal tears and the condition. The results included meniscal tears occurring in 50% to 100% of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee patients, with the extent of medial meniscus extrusion correlating with the stage and volume of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee lesions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;This led to the hypothesis that disruption of the posterior medial meniscus root increases tibiofemoral contact pressures, altering knee biomechanics and leading to the subchondral insufficiency fractures characteristic of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r13">[13]</xref>&#x000a0;Further evidence is needed to pinpoint the exact pathogenesis of the disease, as it remains a source of controversy. &#x000a0;</p>

        <p>Epidemiological studies reveal a higher occurrence of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee in Western populations, a discrepancy that could be due to variations in lifestyle, healthcare accessibility, and diagnostic practices. The notable prevalence among older adults, particularly postmenopausal women&#x000a0;aged&#x000a0;60 or older, reinforces the proposed role of age-related bone density loss and osteoporosis in the development of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;This correlation extends to associations with medial meniscus posterior root tears, suggesting a complex interplay of risk factors, including age, gender, bone health, and possibly genetic predisposition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r13">[13]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r15">[15]</xref></p>

        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>Patients with spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee typically present with acute-onset, unilateral knee pain, which is disproportionate to any inciting event.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r17">[17]</xref>&#x000a0;The pain is localized, often on the medial side, and exacerbated by weight-bearing activities.

This presentation can mimic other degenerative joint diseases, necessitating a thorough examination and differential diagnosis.</p>
        <p>Physical examination reveals tenderness at the joint line, particularly over the medial femoral condyle.

        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>The&#x000a0;diagnosis of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee is primarily based on clinical presentation and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, focusing on excluding other potential causes of knee pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;The initial evaluation should include plain radiographs of the knee, which show subchondral sclerosis, collapse, joint space narrowing, and flattening of the involved condyles in the later stages of the disease. Early in the disease course, however, x-rays are often normal.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r21">[21]</xref></p>
        <p>MRI is the gold standard for diagnosing spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee, given its high sensitivity to bone edema.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r14">[14]</xref>&#x000a0;Key MRI findings include bone marrow edema, subchondral crescent fracture lines, and&#x000a0;focal areas of necrosis with epiphyseal contour depression. T1-weighted images generally reveal a serpentine low-signal area representing necrotic bone surrounded by edematous bone marrow, while T2-weighted images more clearly highlight the edema. A subchondral crescent or linear focus of low signal intensity may be observed in both T1 and potentially T2 sequences.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r22">[22]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>MRI's high sensitivity is instrumental in evaluating the extent of the disease, which is crucial for devising treatment strategies. MRI enables precise measurements of the lesion's width, depth, and height in both coronal and sagittal sections, and offers accurate assessments of meniscal tears and the degree of meniscal extrusion, which are pivotal in understanding spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee's pathophysiology. Although bone scintigraphy is less frequently used due to its lower sensitivity and specificity compared to MRI, it may reveal increased uptake in the affected area.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r14">[14]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>In addition to imaging, laboratory tests may be conducted to rule out other causes of knee pain, such as infection or inflammatory arthritis. These tests include a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein levels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r23">[23]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>

<bold>Treatment and Management of Spontaneous Osteonecrosis of the Knee</bold>
</p>
        <p>The management of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee is personalized depending on disease severity, symptomatology, and patient health status.&#x000a0;The decision to treat spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee is largely based on lesion size and stage. Small lesions may regress with non-surgical management, while larger lesions often necessitate surgical intervention. In the pre-collapse state, joint-preserving procedures should be attempted. If post-collapse has occurred, total joint arthroplasty is a viable option. Treatment ranges from nonoperative approaches in early, less severe cases to operative interventions when conservative measures fail or the disease progresses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r14">[14]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r24">[24]</xref></p>

        <title>Prognosis</title>
        <p>The prognosis of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee varies depending on the size of the lesion, with more extensive lesions portending an increased risk of disease progression and subsequent need for surgical management.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r27">[27]</xref>&#x000a0;Early-stage spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee can have a favorable outcome with the resolution of symptoms and preservation of joint function, especially when managed conservatively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r26">[26]</xref>&#x000a0;However, if left untreated or in advanced stages, spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee can lead to joint collapse and significant functional impairment.</p>
        <p>The prognosis also depends on factors such as patient age, comorbidities, and overall health status. Younger patients with fewer comorbidities generally have a better prognosis, as they are more likely to respond positively to conservative treatments and recover more effectively from surgical interventions. Jureus et al reported there was an extremely high likelihood of progression to osteoarthritis when 40% or more of the joint surface was affected by spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee for patients with a mean follow-up of 15 years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;The success of surgical interventions, such as TKA, in advanced spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee is favorable, with most patients achieving pain relief and improved joint function. However, the prognosis is less favorable in younger patients or those with active lifestyles, as joint replacement may limit certain activities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r19">[19]</xref></p>
        <p>The prognosis of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee is also closely tied to the stage of the disease at diagnosis, with classifications like the Koshino classification providing a framework for understanding disease progression and associated outcomes.&#x000a0;The Koshino classification helps clinicians estimate the disease's progression and guide treatment decisions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r14">[14]</xref>&#x000a0;Early stages (1&#x000a0;and 2) have a more favorable prognosis with conservative management, focusing on symptom relief and preventing further joint damage. In contrast, stages 3 and 4 often require more aggressive interventions due to the higher risk of joint collapse and severe osteoarthritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r5">[5]</xref></p>

        <p>Deterrence of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee involves educating patients about risk factors and early symptoms to promote timely medical intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;Key to this is raising awareness about the condition, particularly in high-risk groups such as older patients and postmenopausal women. Patients should be informed about the importance of maintaining good bone health through adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, regular weight-bearing exercises, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, all of which can reduce the risk of osteoporosis and spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r23">[23]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r25">[25]</xref></p>
        <p>Patient education should also focus on recognizing early signs of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee, like sudden knee pain without a history of trauma, especially in older adults. This knowledge can prompt early medical consultation, leading to quicker diagnosis and management and potentially mitigating the progression of the disease.

        <p>
<bold>Historical Anecdotes</bold>
</p>
        <p><bold>Origin:</bold> The term "osteonecrosis" was first used in the early 20th century, but the specific understanding of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee evolved much later. The condition is named after&#x000a0;Dr Ahlb&#x000e4;ck (Ahlb&#x000e4;ck disease), who was one of the first to describe it in 1968 and brought attention to its unique presentation in the knee.&#x000a0;Despite its name, the "spontaneous" nature of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee is somewhat misleading. Emerging evidence suggests that microtraumas, often unnoticed by patients, may play a significant role in its pathogenesis.</p>
        <p><bold>Evolution of understanding:</bold> Historically, spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee was often misdiagnosed as arthritis due to similar symptoms. Advancements in imaging techniques, especially MRI, have greatly improved the accuracy of diagnosis, distinguishing it from other joint pathologies.&#x000a0;There is ongoing research into the potential genetic predisposition for spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee, which could open avenues for preventive strategies in the future.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Clinical Pearls</bold>
</p>
        <p><bold>Age and gender specificity</bold>: Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee most commonly affects women aged 60 or older. This demographic focus provides a crucial diagnostic clue when an older patient presents with acute knee pain.</p>
        <p><bold>Rapid onset</bold>: Unlike degenerative joint diseases, which develop gradually, spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee typically presents with a sudden onset of pain in the absence of trauma. This rapid onset should raise suspicion for spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee in the appropriate demographic.</p>
        <p><bold>Importance of early intervention</bold>: Early diagnosis and management can significantly alter the disease's progression. Delayed treatment can lead to joint collapse and the need for more invasive procedures such as TKA.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Diagnostic Pitfalls</bold>
</p>
        <p><bold>Misinterpreting imaging</bold>: MRI findings in the early stages of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee can be subtle, leading to underdiagnosis. To avoid misinterpretation, radiologists and clinicians must recognize early signs of the condition, such as bone marrow edema.</p>
        <p><bold>Differentiating from meniscal tears</bold>: Spontaneous&#x000a0;osteonecrosis of the knee can mimic symptoms of meniscal tears or other ligamentous injuries. However, unlike meniscal tears, spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee shows specific changes in the subchondral bone.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Management Pearls</bold>
</p>
        <p><bold>Conservative management</bold>: In the early stages, conservative management, including rest, analgesia, and possibly bracing, can be effective. This approach is often preferred in older patients where surgery poses higher risks.</p>
        <p><bold>Surgical decisions</bold>: For advanced cases, surgical options like core decompression or osteotomy can be considered, but the decision should be based on a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's overall health, activity level, and the disease's extent.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Patient Education</bold>
</p>
        <p><bold>Activity modification</bold>: Educating patients about activity modification and weight management is crucial. Reducing the load on the affected knee can slow the progression and alleviate symptoms.</p>
        <p><bold>Osteoporosis management</bold>: Given the association with osteoporosis, patients should be counseled on bone health, including diet, exercise, and medication to improve bone density.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-58174.s14" sec-type="Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes ">
        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>Effective management of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee requires a highly coordinated effort from an interprofessional healthcare team, comprising physicians, nurses, radiologists, physical therapists, and, when necessary, orthopedic surgeons. Physicians and advanced practice providers&#x000a0;are critical&#x000a0;in conducting the initial assessment, diagnosing spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee, and formulating a comprehensive treatment plan. Radiologists contribute significantly by&#x000a0;interpreting imaging studies crucial for diagnosis, while nurses are instrumental in patient education, ensuring adherence to treatment plans, and providing ongoing support. Physical therapists develop personalized rehabilitation programs to maintain joint function and muscle strength. In cases requiring surgical intervention, orthopedic surgeons collaborate closely with the team to select the most suitable procedure and manage preoperative and postoperative protocols. Regular team meetings and a centralized system for documenting patient interactions ensure that all team members stay informed and maintain a unified approach.</p>
        <p>Gaining a deeper understanding of the condition's etiology, alongside advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, is crucial for shedding light on this complex condition. Although relatively rare, spontaneous&#x000a0;osteonecrosis of the knee demands a high level of vigilance from healthcare providers, especially during the evaluation of patients with knee tenderness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-58174.r19">[19]</xref> Given that this condition is often initially encountered by primary care providers or in emergency departments, it underscores the importance of being well-versed in spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee. Prompt recognition, accurate diagnosis, and timely referral to specialists are essential for preventing significant disability. An orthopedic-trained nurse or advanced practice provider plays a vital role in managing spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee, aiding in patient compliance with medical therapy, assisting during surgical interventions, and providing patient counseling and post-surgical assessments. The collaborative efforts of these diverse specialties highlight the significance of an interprofessional team approach in achieving optimal outcomes for patients with spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee, regardless of the disease stage.&#x000a0;</p>
