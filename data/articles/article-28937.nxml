        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>A new and rapidly progressive respiratory syndrome termed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was identified by the World health organization (WHO) in the Guangdong province of China as a global threat in March of 2003. SARS went on to spread globally over the following months to over 30 countries and became the 1st pandemic of the 21st century.&#x000a0;It showed that the dissemination of an infectious microbe could be drastically increased in the era of globalization and increased international travel. The decade preceding the SARS outbreak featured the emergence of multiple novel pathogens, including H5N1 influenza, Hantavirus, Nipah virus, and Avian flu. However, SARS was unique among these as it had the ability for efficient person-to-person transmission.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28937.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;By the end of the outbreak in July 2003, 8096 cases were reported leading to 774 deaths with a case fatality rate of over 9.6%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28937.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28937.r3">[3]</xref> SARS&#x000a0;showed a unique predilection for healthcare workers,&#x000a0;with 21% of cases occurring in these individuals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28937.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>The WHO, along with its international partners, including the centers for disease control and prevention (CDC), was able to identify within two weeks the etiologic agent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28937.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28937.r6">[6]</xref> The agent was a novel coronavirus and was given the name SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It was isolated in a number of SARS patients and suspected as the causative agent before ultimately being sequenced and fulfilling Koch postulates confirming it as the cause.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28937.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>The number of secondary cases produced by one SARS patient is thought to be in the range of two to four though a few patients, including the original index case, were&#x000a0;suspected to be &#x0201c;super-spreaders&#x0201d; spreading to up to hundreds of others. The mode of transmission for the virus was largely through respiratory inhalation of droplets. Treatment was primarily supportive, and no specific anti-virals were effective.&#x000a0;Since mid-2004, no new cases of SARS have been reported. Until the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the global reach of SARS had been matched only by the 2009 H1N1 Influenza pandemic.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28937.r8">[8]</xref> Lessons learned from the SARS pandemic are currently used as a blueprint to fight the pandemic of COVID19.</p>

        <p>The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was established as the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) after fulfilling all of Koch postulates.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28937.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;SARS-CoV was demonstrated in respiratory secretions of SARS patients by techniques including reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as well as in samples of urine, feces, and lung biopsy specimens.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28937.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;Experimental infection of the virus in macaques produced a similar respiratory syndrome to SARS in humans, which other pathogens detected in SARS patients did not. Coronaviruses are named for their crown-like glycoprotein spikes on their surface. Coronaviruses are large single-stranded RNA viruses that have helical nucleocapsids.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28937.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;They are usually associated with humans with the common cold, though, and in animals, they&#x02019;re linked with a highly virulent disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28937.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;SARS-CoV is thought to have jumped from an animal reservoir in the horseshoe bat through an intermediate host in the palm civet and then to humans.</p>

        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>The case definition of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is defined by both the WHO and the CDC. A case of SARS occurs in a person with laboratory confirmation of infection who meets the clinical criteria or who has worked in a lab with live SARS coronavirus. The clinical criteria include fever or a history of fever along with one or more symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness such as cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing and radiographic findings of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or an autopsy finding of pneumonia or ARDS without an identifiable cause and no alternative explanation of the illness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28937.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;Laboratory&#x000a0;diagnosis of SARS is confirmed if there are two samples obtained from two different sites or two samples from one site obtained at two different times, showing the presence of a virus by an assay for viral RNA using reverse transcriptase PCR.</p>
        <p>When SARS is suspected in a patient, diagnostic workup should include complete blood count with differential, chest x-ray, pulse oximetry, blood cultures, Gram stain, and culture of sputum, Legionella, and Pneumococcal antigen testing as well as viral respiratory pathogen panels. Additionally, the samples for specific SARS-CoV testing should be performed in coordination with the local health department and the CDC or WHO.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28937.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;SARS-CoV testing for diagnosis should be done via PCR from samples obtained from at least two sites and as early in the illness as possible and then repeated five to seven days later if symptoms continue. Serum antibody titers by ELISA is the most sensitive available test; however, seroconversion can take weeks to develop making it less useful for diagnosis at the time of care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28937.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>Laboratory findings vary with the most common identified abnormalities being low total lymphocytes, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28937.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;Elevated D-dimer and a mild increase in activated partial thromboplastin time activation have been noted.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28937.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;Additionally, thrombocytopenia was noted typically as the respiratory phase of the illness was peaking.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28937.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28937.r4">[4]</xref></p>

            <p>Corticosteroid treatment was trialed in the early phase of the SARS epidemic before proving not to be beneficial. Complications of prolonged high-dose corticosteroid therapy such as avascular necrosis and disseminated fungal infection were identified in SARS patients on these therapies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28937.r7">[7]</xref></p>

        <p>While prevention modalities such as effective antiviral therapy, vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, or natural immunity are lacking, the public health measures of rapid case identification and containment are of the utmost importance. The fact that patients during the prodromal phase of&#x000a0;the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have lower contagiousness allows the application of containment precautions once they become symptomatic to be effective in containing transmission.</p>
        <p>Control of the disease relies on early identification of suspect cases, isolation, and strict infection control measures. SARS-CoV may also spread by the fecal-oral route as evidenced by the outbreak in the Amoy Gardens building in Hong Kong.&#x000a0;Therefore, in addition to respiratory secretions, fecal material and urine should be considered infectious materials. SARS-CoV can remain viable on surfaces for several days.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28937.r7">[7]</xref></p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>Knowledge of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by the interprofessional team members should help in the early detection as well as proper management of the disease should it recur. Moreover, this knowledge can be applied not just to a recurrence of SARS-CoV but to any other novel coronavirus, such as we are currently seeing with SARS-CoV2 or other infectious pandemics. This knowledge should enhance patient care, improve outcomes for patients as well as safety for healthcare workers, and improve performance throughout the healthcare team. This is of increased importance in a disease such as SARS, given that 1 in 5 cases was seen in healthcare workers, and healthcare centers were major amplifiers of the disease. Additionally, in the case of pandemics, the healthcare team extends from the frontline clinical workers to health departments, research laboratories, internal health organizations, and governments. Knowledge and coordination are important across all of these organizations and their team members.</p>
        <p>Research during the years following the SARS pandemic revealed the existence of many different coronaviruses circulating in bats and other animals, suggesting that the emergence of another coronavirus into humans was not just possible but inevitable.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28937.r14">[14]</xref> The lessons from SARS may prove invaluable in the management of these diseases. More than 10 years before the SARS outbreak, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released a report on the risks of emerging microbial diseases and outlining factors they felt increased the threat in this global era we live in as well as steps they felt that could address them.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28937.r15">[15]</xref>&#x000a0;The report emphasized the need for increased surveillance and response capacity, things which proved of paramount importance in the management of the SARS outbreak. These factors and the entirety of SARS knowledge will be of the utmost importance in the battle against SARS-CoV2, which&#x000a0;as of May 27, 2021, had already killed more people than SARS and MERS combined despite having a lower case fatality rate of 2%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28937.r16">[16]</xref></p>
