        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Cockayne syndrome is an autosomal recessive rare genetic disorder resulting from a DNA repair defect, leading to&#x000a0;heightened sensitivity of cells in affected individuals to the lethal effects of UV light.&#x000a0;Individuals with this disorder display unique facial characteristics, including sunken eyes, a beaked nose, and prominent ears, and also experience progressive dementia.&#x000a0;In addition to these characteristics, individuals with Cockayne syndrome frequently exhibit cachectic dwarfism, intellectual disabilities, skin and hair thinning, failure to thrive, short stature with a stooped standing posture, microcephaly, progressive neurological dysfunction resulting from demyelination, retinal degeneration accompanied by pigmented retinopathy and optic atrophy, kyphoscoliosis, gait defects, neuromotor abnormalities,&#x000a0;compromised&#x000a0;vision and hearing, and sun&#x000a0;sensitivity.</p>
        <p>Cockayne syndrome was&#x000a0;first identified in 1936 by the British physician Dr Edward Alfred Cockayne.&#x000a0;Cockayne syndrome&#x000a0;manifests as a spectrum that can be divided into 3 types&#x02014;I, II, and III. This syndrome is specifically associated&#x000a0;with mutations in 2 defective excision repair cross-complementation genes (ERCC)&#x02014;the&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">ERCC8</italic>&#x000a0;(Cockayne syndrome A or&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">CSA</italic>) gene for Cockayne syndrome type&#x000a0;I and the&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">ERCC6</italic>&#x000a0;(Cockayne syndrome B or&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">CSB</italic>) gene for Cockayne syndrome type II.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Cockayne syndrome type II is the most severe variant that manifests at birth, and individuals typically succumb within the first decade of life. Cockayne syndrome type&#x000a0;I becomes evident in early childhood, with death typically occurring in early adolescence. Cockayne syndrome type&#x000a0;III represents a milder form that becomes apparent later in life.&#x000a0;An additional variant&#x02014;the xeroderma pigmentosum&#x02013;Cockayne syndrome overlap complex&#x02014;stems from mutations in different&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">ERCC</italic>&#x000a0;genes such as&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">ERCC2</italic>,&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">ERCC3</italic>, and&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">XPD</italic>.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Unlike xeroderma pigmentosum, where sun sensitivity is associated with an elevated risk of skin cancer, individuals with Cockayne syndrome are sun-sensitive but do not exhibit an increased rate of cancer. The treatment for CS is mainly supportive and focuses on managing and preventing the associated complications. Children affected by Cockayne syndrome experience a reduced life expectancy, with the majority succumbing by early adolescence. Thus, early engagement of a multidisciplinary healthcare team is crucial in mitigating morbidity and enhancing the overall quality of life.</p>

      <sec id="article-19676.s3" sec-type="Etiology">
        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>Cockayne syndrome is an autosomal recessive rare genetic disorder associated with mutations in ERCC genes. Based on the affected gene, this syndrome encompasses 2 complementation groups&#x02014;CSA and CSB. Eighty percent of affected patients appear to be in the CSB complementation group, involving the&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">ERCC6</italic>&#x000a0;gene on band 10q11 or the&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">CSB</italic>&#x000a0;gene. The remaining cases are in the CSA complementation group, involving the&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">ERCC8</italic> gene&#x000a0;on&#x000a0;band 5q12.1 or the&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">CSA</italic>&#x000a0;gene. To date, more than 30 CSA and 78 CSB mutations have been identified.</p>
        <p>The participation of CSA and CSB proteins is essential for transcription-coupled repair (TCR), representing a subpathway within nucleotide-excision repair (NER). Alterations in the <italic toggle="yes">CSB</italic> gene result in the altered expression of antiangiogenic and cell cycle genes and proteins. A notable impact is&#x000a0;observed on p21&#x02014;an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase&#x02014;that links DNA damage to cell cycle arrest. This impact has the potential to hinder cell cycle progression and growth. Another variant&#x02014;the xeroderma pigmentosum-Cockayne syndrome overlap complex&#x02014;emerges from mutations in distinct <italic toggle="yes">ERCC</italic> genes such as <italic toggle="yes">ERCC2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ERCC3</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">XPD</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;These genetic abnormalities lead to compromised DNA repair mechanisms and increased sensitivity to UV light and cause various cellular consequences, including reduced DNA and RNA synthesis, increased sister chromatid exchanges, and heightened chromosomal breaks.&#x000a0;</p>

      <sec id="article-19676.s4" sec-type="Epidemiology">
        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>Cockayne syndrome is a rare disorder with an unknown prevalence. The annual estimate in Europe is 1 case per 200,000 births.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;No racial or sexual predilection has been reported for Cockayne syndrome.&#x000a0;</p>

      <sec id="article-19676.s5" sec-type="Pathophysiology">
        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>The underlying pathophysiology of Cockayne syndrome, as well as xeroderma pigmentosum and trichothiodystrophy, involves cellular sensitivity to UV irradiation due to a defect in DNA repair. These disorders arise from genetic defects&#x000a0;that affect NER and RNA transcription. The&#x000a0;NER pathway is involved in protection against UV-induced DNA damage. In individuals with Cockayne syndrome, the&#x000a0;NER of most genomic DNA remains unaffected, thereby mitigating the heightened risk of skin cancer. Unlike xeroderma pigmentosum, which is associated with an increased risk of skin cancer, Cockayne syndrome and trichothiodystrophy do not exhibit such susceptibility.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">CSA</italic>&#x000a0;or&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">CSB</italic>&#x000a0;genes are necessary for the TCR pathway&#x02014;a subtype of NER involved in repairing UV-induced DNA damage in actively transcribed genes. Individuals with Cockayne syndrome exhibit alterations in either the <italic toggle="yes">CSA</italic>&#x000a0;or&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">CSB</italic>&#x000a0;genes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Mutations in&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">ERCC</italic>&#x000a0;genes can cause defective DNA repair following exposure to UV radiation. However, the pathogenesis of this syndrome is more complicated, as changes can manifest at birth, even before UV exposure. Typically, the impact involves the nervous system, where cells have not encountered UV light exposure.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Defects in the <italic toggle="yes">CSB</italic> gene lead to altered expression of antiangiogenic and cell cycle genes and proteins, potentially inhibiting cell cycle progression and growth. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (p21) is notably affected and actively participates in repairing cellular damage caused by radiation-induced DNA damage. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 connects DNA damage to cell cycle arrest. Specifically, when exposed to UVB, p21 binds to proliferating cell nuclear antigen, hindering DNA replication and preventing entry into mitosis. This mechanism lowers the risk of malignancy, as cells undergoing apoptosis do not form tumors. The surviving cells display perfectly normal global genomic repair.</p>
        <p>The severe developmental challenges are likely explained by endogenous oxidative damage in certain metabolically active cells, such as neurons, which obstruct transcription. The lack of TCR subsequently triggers apoptosis in these crucial cells. Researchers propose these alterations to elucidate the non-cutaneous symptoms of Cockayne syndrome that cannot be solely attributed to deficiencies in DNA repair.&#x000a0;</p>

        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>
<bold>Classification</bold>
</p>
        <p>Although affected individuals typically appear normal at birth, the severity and age of onset age show significant variability across the clinical spectrum. Hence, researchers classify Cockayne syndrome into 3 types based on the age of presentation and clinical features, as mentioned below.</p>
        <p><bold>Cockayne syndrome type&#x000a0;I:</bold>&#x000a0;This is the most common form of Cockayne syndrome that manifests during childhood.</p>
        <p><bold>Cockayne syndrome type&#x000a0;II:</bold>&#x000a0;This type manifests at birth and presents with more severe symptoms compared to other types of the syndrome.</p>
        <p><bold>Cockayne syndrome type&#x000a0;III:</bold>&#x000a0;This type appears&#x000a0;later in childhood but with less severe symptoms than other types of the syndrome.</p>
        <p>In cases where Cockayne syndrome presents in adulthood, affected individuals may exhibit gait and cognitive impairments, chorea, and neuropathy. Neuroimaging might reveal global atrophy.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Clinical Features</bold>
</p>
        <p><bold>Growth disorders and physical features:&#x000a0;</bold>Progressive growth restriction occurs between the ages of 1 and 2 and is characterized by failure to thrive and microcephaly. As children age, they lose subcutaneous fat, resulting in a prematurely aged face and dysmorphic features such as prominent ears, sunken eyes, a beaked nose, and a cachectic body with thin, slender limbs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r10">[10]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Neurological disorders and intellectual development:&#x000a0;</bold>Neurological manifestations progress gradually and result from demyelination. Affected children may endure a range of symptoms, including progressive sensorineural hearing loss leading to profound deafness,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;intellectual disabilities, difficulty walking, unsteady gait, poor balance, ataxia, tremors, spasticity in the lower limbs, constant flexure of the arms and legs,&#x000a0;variations in muscle tone and reflexes, epilepsy in some cases, labored and unintelligible speech, and polyneuropathies&#x02014;with sensorimotor demyelinating polyneuropathy being the most common.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r12">[12]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r10">[10]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Skin Findings</bold>
</p>
        <p>Children with this condition exhibit thin and sensitive skin, making them susceptible to severe sunburns. Even minimal exposure to UV rays can lead to sunburns with subsequent scarring. The increased photosensitivity also impacts the eyes, with photosensitive eruptions presenting as erythema and scaling. The skin may also exhibit hyperpigmentation, telangiectasia, and atrophy. Subcutaneous lipoatrophy contributes to the development of sunken eyes and a prematurely aged progeric appearance. Common findings include cyanotic acral edema of the extremities, nail dystrophies, and hair anomalies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r13">[13]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Dental Abnormalities</bold>
</p>
        <p>The deciduous teeth may appear late and exhibit characteristics such as being small, irregular, and abnormally spaced. In certain instances, permanent teeth may not develop; when they do, they remain small or poorly implanted. Children affected by this condition are more prone to cavities than the average population.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Musculoskeletal</bold>
</p>
        <p>Children affected by Cockayne syndrome may display an atypical gait attributed to leg spasticity, ataxia, and contractures in the hips, knees, and ankles. Additional features include microcephaly, short stature, elongated limbs with joint contractures, oversized hands and feet, kyphosis, thickened calvariae, sclerotic epiphyses in the fingers, and possible osteoporosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r10">[10]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r14">[14]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Ocular</bold>
</p>
        <p>Retinal degeneration, marked by pigmented retinopathy and optic atrophy, is common. Anophthalmia often arises due to losing the typical fat pad behind the eyeball. Observations may include miotic pupils, strabismus, cataracts, optic atrophy, corneal opacity, blepharokeratoconjunctivitis, and nystagmus.</p>
        <p>The distinctive "salt and pepper pattern" in progressive retinal pigmentation is associated with Cockayne syndrome. Although&#x000a0;vision is typically normal, the development of cataracts and optic nerve atrophy in pigmentary retinopathy can impair it. Moreover, the onset of uveitis or conjunctivitis may further exacerbate visual impairments.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r10">[10]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Fragile</bold>&#x000a0;<bold>Livers</bold></p>
        <p>Cockayne syndrome can affect the liver and is primarily asymptomatic, manifesting as elevated plasma transaminase levels. Owing to several reported cases of hepatotoxicity in patients with Cockayne syndrome, methotrexate is contraindicated and should be avoided. Occasionally, hepatomegaly may be evident during physical examination.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Renal Disease</bold>
</p>
        <p>Renal disease, increased blood pressure, and hyperuricemia may also be present.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r15">[15]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Endocrine Dysfunction</bold>
</p>
        <p>Endocrine dysfunction in individuals can lead to a range of problems, including hypogonadism in males, which occurs in around 30% of cases, and irregular menses in females as a result of endocrine dysfunction.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-19676.s7" sec-type="Evaluation">
        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>Children with suspected Cockayne syndrome undergo a multidisciplinary evaluation, incorporating laboratory and imaging studies primarily to exclude other diagnoses. The comprehensive evaluation includes genetic, developmental, ophthalmological with electroretinography, neurological with electroencephalography and nerve conduction studies, gastrointestinal with a nutritionist, audiological with audiometry, dermatological, dental, endocrinology, and baseline and annual renal function studies.</p>
        <p>The genetic evaluation includes chromosome analysis, chromosome microarray, chromosome breakage studies, mutational analysis of&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">ERCC8</italic>&#x000a0;and&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">ERCC6</italic> genes, and cell culturing from amniotic fluid or skin biopsy.</p>
        <p>Chromosome breakage studies and DNA mutation analysis are crucial for excluding Bloom syndrome and xeroderma pigmentosum. Cell fluid culturing is a means to conduct a prenatal or postnatal evaluation. This method illustrates the deficiency in RNA synthesis in fetal or the cells of a child following UV irradiation and measures the rate of DNA repair on fibroblasts. A biopsy of skin specimens is required to perform this technique. In cases of Cockayne syndrome, the test reveals a lower-than-normal repair rate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r16">[16]</xref></p>
        <p>Cell fluid culturing, less commonly chosen due to the widespread availability of genetic testing for <italic toggle="yes">ERCC8</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ERCC6</italic> variants, may not be readily available at most labs. An endocrinological evaluation is essential to rule out any hormonal causes of failure to thrive.</p>
        <p>Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans can unveil a range of changes, including central nervous system white matter demyelination, severe cerebral white matter atrophy, cerebellar atrophy, perivascular calcifications in the cerebellum and basal ganglia, patchy demyelination often referred to as "tigroid leukodystrophy," increased ventricular size, and normal pressure hydrocephaly.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-19676.s8" sec-type="Treatment / Management">
        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>The management of Cockayne syndrome is supportive and focuses on managing and preventing complications. The fundamental elements include sun protection for the skin and eyes, physical and occupational therapies, nutritional support, dental and eye care, hearing assessment, blood pressure monitoring, and routine monitoring of kidney and&#x000a0;liver functions and blood sugar levels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r15">[15]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r17">[17]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Feeding Assistance</bold>
</p>
        <p>Many affected infants require feeding assistance in the initial months of life due to muscle weakness and neurological impairment. In some cases, the use of a nasogastric tube or even a gastrostomy may be deemed necessary.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r12">[12]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Treatment of Ocular Anomalies</bold>
</p>
        <p>Cataracts often develop by age 4 and can be treated through surgery to remove the opaque lens. In such surgeries, surgeons generally refrain from implanting a transparent artificial lens.</p>
        <p>When strabismus is present, early intervention is crucial. Orthoptists play a key role in re-education sessions as a foundational aspect of the treatment. To encourage the affected eye to work, masking the healthy eye with an eye mask or an opaque eyeglass lens is utilized. In cases of persistent deviation, surgery may be required to remove or reduce the misalignment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19676.r13">[13]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Dental Care</bold>
</p>
        <p>Affected children should have regular dental evaluations due to their increased risk of dental caries.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Prevention Against the Sun's Harmful Effects</bold>
</p>
        <p>Individuals affected by this condition should safeguard themselves from UV light exposure.&#x000a0;Certain artificial lights, including neon and halogen, emit harmful UV radiation, requiring protection for affected individuals. Recommendations include wearing broad-brimmed hats, UV-resistant clothing with collars, and sunscreen with a sun protection factor of 50 or higher during outdoor activities and outings. This precaution is advisable even during winter or late afternoon when light intensity may appear lower.

        <p>Cockayne syndrome is a rare genetic disorder causing excess sensitivity to UV light exposure due to defective DNA repair. Affected patients exhibit distinctive facial features, including prominent ears, sunken eyes, and a beaked nose. Additional hallmark characteristics encompass microcephaly, intellectual disabilities, failure to thrive, and short stature. Furthermore, these patients are prone to severe sunburns with minimal exposure to UV light.</p>
        <p>The initial evaluation includes genetic testing for a formal diagnosis. In addition, patients should undergo initial assessments in audiology, ophthalmology, dermatology, neurology, and endocrinology to exclude other causes of poor growth. Ongoing regular evaluations are crucial for monitoring hypertension, renal pathology, hearing loss, dental caries, and neurological deterioration in affected children.</p>
        <p>The treatment for Cockayne syndrome focuses on preventing and managing complications associated with the illness. Sun protection is crucial for individuals with Cockayne syndrome, and recommendations include wearing hats with a large brim, UV-blocking clothing, closed collars, and using sunscreen with a sun protection factor of 50 or higher during outdoor activities and outings. This precautionary measure is advised even during winter or late afternoon when the brightness may seem diminished. Special glasses or a UV-filtering mask should also be worn to protect the eyes. Physical and occupational therapy are crucial to maintain mobility and prevent joint contractures. In addition, supportive equipment such as a corset, wheelchair, cane, or walker may be necessary to aid mobility.</p>

        <p>Patients with Cockayne syndrome experience severe motor, sensory, and intellectual disabilities. Early identification and management are crucial to mitigate morbidity and enhance overall quality of life. The care of individuals with Cockayne syndrome necessitates an interprofessional and collaborative approach, aiming to prevent morbidity and improve overall patient outcomes.</p>
        <p>Healthcare professionals working in genetics, neurology, audiology, physical therapy, occupational therapy, ophthalmology, endocrinology, primary care, pharmacy, and other relevant fields should have the required clinical knowledge and expertise to promptly and accurately diagnose Cockayne syndrome in patients and provide effective management of the condition. Managing Cockayne syndrome requires expertise in recognizing the various body systems affected by the condition. Furthermore, establishing a baseline status and implementing routine monitoring of patients is necessary to prevent complications associated with the disease.</p>
        <p>Beyond medical support, patients and their families may require assistance from psychologists and social workers to navigate the financial and psychosocial challenges associated with Cockayne syndrome. Care coordination and effective interprofessional communication are paramount in delivering patient-centered care and facilitating collaborative decision-making among team members. Adhering to the principles of skill, responsibilities, interprofessional communication, and care coordination, healthcare professionals can provide patient-centered care, ultimately improving patient outcomes and enhancing team performance in managing Cockayne syndrome.</p>
