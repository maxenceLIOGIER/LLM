        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Mood is defined as a pervasive and sustained feeling tone that is endured internally, and that impacts nearly all aspects of a person&#x02019;s behavior in the external world. Mood disorders or affective disorders are described by marked disruptions in emotions (severe lows called depression or highs called hypomania or mania). These are common psychiatric disorders leading to an increase in morbidity and mortality.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), mood disorders have been broadly categorized as bipolar disorders and depressive disorders.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-91517.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Bipolar disorders are further categorized as bipolar I, bipolar II, cyclothymic disorder, bipolar and related disorder to another medical condition, substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder, other specified bipolar and related disorder, and unspecified bipolar and related disorder.&#x000a0;</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Bipolar I disorder is defined as a syndrome in which a complete set of mania symptoms (elevated mood with three or more of the following symptoms- increased goal-directed activity, grandiosity, a diminished need for sleep, distractibility, racing thoughts, increased/pressured speech, and reckless behaviors) has occurred lasting for at least one week or required hospitalization. If the mood is irritable instead of elevated, four or more of the aforementioned symptoms are needed to meet the criteria for a manic episode.&#x000a0;</p>

            <p>Cyclothymia is defined as a subthreshold bipolar trait or temperament with low-grade affective manifestations of the sub-threshold major depression and mild hypomania. It is diagnosed in adults&#x000a0;who experience at least 2 years of both hypomanic and depressive periods without ever meeting the criteria for mania, hypomania, or major depression.&#x000a0;For a child or an adolescent to be diagnosed with cyclothymia, these episodes should last over 1 year.&#x000a0;</p>

            <p>Hypomania is defined as a non-psychotic, milder, or subthreshold manic state of short duration lasting for at least four consecutive days and without marked social and occupational impairment. It requires elevated mood with (three or more symptoms) or irritable mood (with four or more of the following symptoms) - increased goal-directed activity, grandiosity, a diminished need for sleep, distractibility, racing thoughts, increased/pressured speech, and reckless behaviors. According to the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11), cyclothymia and hypomania are considered as a prodrome of bipolar disorders,&#x000a0;and per DSM 5, hypomania is a component of bipolar II disorder.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-91517.r2">[2]</xref></p>

        <p>Major depressive disorder is diagnosed by the presence of 5 out of the 9 symptoms of sad mood, insomnia, feelings of guilt, decreased energy levels, decreased concentration, decreased appetite, decrease in pleasurable activities (anhedonia), increased or decreased psychomotor activity, and recurrent suicidal ideation/acts of self-harm/suicide attempt existing over a period of 2 weeks.</p>
        <p>Three new depressive disorders have been incorporated under mood disorders in DSM-5:</p>

        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>The brain areas responsible for controlling our feelings and emotions are the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex. Patients with mood disorders have shown to have an enlarged amygdala on brain imaging, which substantiates the certainty that abnormalities in these areas lead to mood disorders. Ventricular expansion results from repeated episodes of mood disorders.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-91517.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Biological Factors</bold>
</p>
        <p>Neurotransmitters that play an important function in mood disorders are serotonin and norepinephrine, which are decreased in episodes of depression. Serotonin is the neurotransmitter most commonly associated with depression. Dopamine has also been implicated in mood disorders with research showing that it may be decreased in depression and increased in mania.&#x000a0;</p>

<bold>Psychosocial Factors</bold>
</p>
        <p>Stressful life changes (death of significant other, parents, siblings, etc.) traumatic events and childhood abuse have been found to be major risk factors for the development of mood disorder later on in life, especially depressive disorder.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-91517.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Personality traits or certain personality disorders like borderline and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are more frequently associated with depression.

<bold>Neuroimmunological Factors</bold>
</p>
        <p>Research shows that mood disorder leads to the altered release of neuroactive cytokines like IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-91517.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>Recent research has found a crucial role of nitric oxide (NO) involved in causing the inflammatory process that leads to signs and symptoms of mood disorder.

        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>Depression is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder represented by severe anhedonia (a substantial incapacity to enjoy pleasurable activities), sad mood, feelings of guilt, suicidality, and cognitive impairment. One of the primary risk factors for the development of depressive disorders is chronic stress. The pathophysiology of constant stress results from overactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which results in glucocorticoid cortisol level increase.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-91517.r16">[16]</xref>&#x000a0;Neuronal plasticity also plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of mood disorder. Patients with poor social support show signs of impaired neuronal plasticity, predisposing them to mood disorders. Mild to moderate impairment of neuronal plasticity causes depression, while severe impairment results in mania.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-91517.r17">[17]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Other symptoms of mood disturbances are decreased sleep and appetite. There could be increased (agitation) or decreased psychomotor activity. Increased agitation can be life-threatening as it can lead to muscle breakdown, followed by kidney failure (due to increased creatinine). In severe cases, the patient may develop psychotic symptoms of delusions and hallucinations. Neurocognitive changes with deficits in attention and concentration, recent and remote memory, and executive functions have been detected in cases of mood disorders. These signs and symptoms are due to an interplay of factors such as genetic vulnerability, positive family history, and social support systems.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-91517.r18">[18]</xref></p>

        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>The evaluation for mood disorders mandates comprehensive and detailed history taking. Patients with bipolar disorder are easily diagnosed when they present with episodes of mania characterized by inflated self-esteem, grandiosity, impulsivity, irritability, increased psychomotor activity, delusions, or hallucinations.&#x000a0;When the patients exhibit symptoms of depression such as sad mood, decreased concentration, guilt, decreased interest in pleasurable activities, ideas of self-harm, and suicide, it is crucial to differentiate unipolar from bipolar depression.&#x000a0;Clinical features suggestive of bipolar depression are early age of onset, acute onset, recurrent episodes of depression (more than 5 episodes), positive family history of bipolar disorder, antidepressant-induced hypomania, depression with psychotic symptoms before the age of 25, postpartum depression, and depressive mixed state.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-91517.r19">[19]</xref>&#x000a0;During history taking patients often ignore past hypomanic or manic episodes, so clinicians must explore periods with mood dysregulation associated with decreased need for sleep and increased energy in the past.&#x000a0;A careful assessment of the risk of suicide and homicide is essential.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Once the patient is stabilized, a formal mental status examination is mandatory.&#x000a0;Patients suffering from depression show poor/limited eye contact during the interview, have a flat or blunted affect with decreased speech and increased reaction time. They appear disheveled with unkempt hair and poor hygiene. Psychomotor activity is markedly decreased. On the other hand, patients with mania have increased psychomotor activity, are agitated, irritable, hyper talkative, have pressured speech, tangentiality, decreased reaction time, and are difficult to interrupt. Patients with mania can sometimes have hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. Occasionally, major depression can have psychotic features.&#x000a0;</p>

        <p>A detailed longitudinal and in-depth family history, followed by a thorough mental status examination, is crucial for early diagnosis of mood disorders. Mood disorders secondary to substance abuse require a urine drug test. Specific rating scales are also available for the evaluation of mood disorders.&#x000a0;Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) are for depression, and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) is for mania.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-91517.r20">[20]</xref></p>

            <p><bold>Lithium</bold>&#x02014; It is the primary mood-stabilizer. The mechanism of action of lithium is to inhibit the hydrolysis of inositol 1 phosphate by inositol monophosphatase. As a result, the supply of free inositol for the regeneration of membrane phosphatidyl&#x02013;inositides, which are the sources of inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol, is reduced. It also inhibits enzyme glycogen synthase kinase, and the&#x000a0;hyperactive neurons involved in manic states are preferentially affected because the supply of inositol from extracellular sources is compromised.</p>

        <p>Mood disorders are common psychiatric disorders associated with high morbidity and mortality. Educating the patients regarding the symptoms and timely treatment is mandatory for recovery from mood disorders. Psychoeducation is important for treatment adherence to medications and psychotherapy and continued engagement in treatment and reduced risk of relapse. At the time of discharge from in-patient facilities, the patients and the caregivers should be taught about the early warning signs of mood disorder relapse. If the patients develop symptoms such as a decreased need for sleep, increased talkativeness, racing thoughts, and feeling more energetic, he/she should be immediately brought to the psychiatry office for treatment optimization. Recovery from mania and depression is very critical, and adherence to medication and therapy is important to recover fully. Regular follow-ups and compliance to treatment should be emphasized in every office visit.</p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>The optimal treatment of patients with mood disorders requires the involvement of various health care professionals comprising of family physicians, nurses, psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers with the strong cooperation of family and support groups. This formulates an integrated care team. Most of the time, the first contact of the patient is a family physician. Patients feel more comfortable discussing their personal matters with family physicians when confronted with a crisis and are unable to cope with the situation. Therefore, the family physician plays a key role in understanding the severity of the symptoms, formulating a diagnosis, and concluding whether a specialist psychiatry referral is required. Patients with moderate to severe mood symptoms with or without active suicidal ideation need a psychiatric referral.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>A mental health case manager (mental health care nurse) appointed by the mental health care team often in community mental health settings is important in cases of severe mood disorders to coordinate patient care.&#x000a0;All health care providers involved in the management of the patient need to be notified of the current treatment plan regularly while the patient is admitted to an in-patient psychiatric unit in the event of a crisis. Outpatient treatment records must be sought from psychiatrists and outpatient providers and completed discharge summaries with a detailed plan of care during psychiatric admission. Psychiatric medications should be sent to outpatient providers prior to discharge from in-patient units.</p>
        <p>The psychiatrist plays an important role in the decision making and treatment plan of the patient, but an overall effective response is seen when the different professionals involved in the patient care work as a collective team. Positive treatment response requires regular communication between the psychiatrists, family physicians, social workers, nurses, case managers, and pharmacists in both in-patient and outpatient settings.</p>
