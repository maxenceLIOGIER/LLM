        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>First isolated in 1982, Shiga toxin-producing <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> O157: H7 has become an important food and waterborne pathogen that causes diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) in humans. An enterohemorrhagic bacterial strain, <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> O157: H7 infects the alimentary tract and induces abdominal cramps with hemorrhagic diarrhea. Transmission of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> O157: H7 occurs via the fecal-oral route after consumption of contaminated, undercooked liquids and foods. Alternatively, <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> 0157: H7 can be transmitted by person-to-person through fecal shedding and accounts for an estimated 11% of infections. The production of Shiga toxins is a key factor contributing to the development of HUS. Enterohemorrhagic <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> O157: H7 induces illness secondary to its production of Shiga toxin that causes a range of gastrointestinal illnesses, from watery diarrhea to hemorrhagic colitis. <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> 0157: H7 induces enterohemorrhagic disease that can cause systemic illness by hemolytic uremic syndrome, which manifests as hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. HUS can result in both acute, potentially life-threatening illness and lifelong, chronic illness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20825.r1">[1]</xref><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="28425902">[2]</ext-link><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20825.r2">[3]</xref></p>

        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p><italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> O157: H7 has become a major, worldwide food-borne pathogen known to result in life-threatening conditions, including HUS and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The epidemiological investigation has identified cattle as the main reservoir for <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> O157: H7 after tracing outbreaks of Shiga toxin enterohemorrhagic diarrhea to domesticated animals, particularly feedlot cattle. Ruminant animals on farms act as a natural reservoir of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> 0157: H7. Zoonotic transmission of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> 0157:H7 occurs after consumption of undercooked meat or deficiently pasteurized dairy products or contact with contaminated fomites laden with Shiga toxin enterohemorrhagic <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>. Other causal etiologies of Shiga toxin enterohemorrhagic E. coli include exposure to contaminated water from potable drinking sources, swimming pools and lakes, contaminated food such as insufficiently cooked meats, inadequately washed leafy greens and fruits, unpasteurized drinks including apple juice, and direct contact with contaminated animals in petting farms. The contamination of fresh fruits and vegetables occurs secondary to fecal contamination in agricultural irrigation water or runoff. Although linked to other bacteria, HUS most commonly occurs after infection with Shiga toxin-producing <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>, termed enterohemorrhagic <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>, particularly <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> 0157:H7. <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> O157 has hardy survival characteristics exceeding those found in commensal <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> strains, which enable this food-borne pathogen to survive a wide range of harsh conditions frequently encountered within the human food chain. This pathogen can persist for extended periods in the food matrix.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20825.r3">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20825.r4">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20825.r5">[6]</xref></p>

        <p><italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> O157: H7 causes an estimated 63,000 hemorrhagic colitis cases annually in the United States. Review of database and studies from 10 out of 14 world health organizations subregions showed the global incidence of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> to be 2.8 million cases per year.&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> O157: H7-induced HUS can result in systemic morbidities, such as acute renal failure, primarily in children. <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> 0157: H7-induced HUS has become an important etiology of acute renal failure in children over the last two decades. While <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> 0157: H7 causes diarrheal illness in both children and adults, systemic complications occur more frequently in children. In adults, <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> 0157: H7 colitis can occasionally cause HUS and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Outbreaks of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> 0157: H7 typically occur sporadically in outbreaks with exposure to contaminated food sources.</p>

        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>The infectious dose of <italic toggle="yes">E.coli</italic>&#x000a0;O157: H7 is, however low. One study shows that as few as ten viable bacteria can cause disease in humans. The pathogenesis of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> O157: H7 results from its production of Shiga toxin that injures the intestine by sloughing off of intestinal mucosa cells and results in hemorrhagic diarrhea. The Shiga toxin has systemic effects on vascular endothelial cells, resulting in vasculitis, and manifests in hemolytic uremic syndrome, abdominal pain, and rarely, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. E. coli 0157:H7 Shiga toxin initiates the inflammatory cascade that causes leukocyte aggregation, apoptosis of the affected cells, platelet aggregation, microthrombi formation, hemolysis, and renal dysfunction, as the renal glomeruli have a particular vulnerability to a microthrombi formation. <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> 0157: H7 Shiga toxin effect manifests not only in the kidney but&#x000a0;in its most severe manifestations, it can result in a diffuse vasculitic injury that affects multiple organ systems and multiple organ failures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20825.r6">[7]</xref></p>

        <title>Histopathology</title>
        <p><italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> O157: H7 attaches to the microvilli of the intestinal epithelial cells utilizing the fimbriae of the intestinal cellular walls. Bacterial attachment results in characteristic effacing lesions that flatten the microvilli as bacteria rearrange the cytoskeletal actin underneath the epithelial layer and disrupt normal intestinal cell function.&#x000a0;Large intestinal biopsy of hemorrhagic colitis specimens demonstrates cellular hemorrhage and edema characteristic of intestinal inflammation. The histologic features resemble a pattern similar to ischemic colitis and other toxin-mediated infectious colitis like <italic toggle="yes">C. difficile</italic>, making <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> O157: H7 challenging to differentiate on histology alone.</p>

      <sec id="article-20825.s7" sec-type="Toxicokinetics">
        <title>Toxicokinetics</title>
        <p>After ingestion of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> O157: H7, the bacteria bind to the intestinal mucosa and begin releasing Shiga toxin. The toxin, in turn, disrupts protein synthesis in the epithelial cells lining intestinal mucosa, leading to cell death, sloughing of the mucosa, and eventual bloody diarrhea. &#x000a0;Following exposure to the Shiga toxin, diarrhea, often the hemorrhagic variety, develops three days after exposure to the contaminated food specimen. After three days of diarrheal symptoms, diarrhea will become bloody in approximately 90% of affected patients. Hemorrhagic diarrheal symptoms will often resolve after seven days, with 85% of patients having a spontaneous resolution; the remainder 15%, often children, will develop systemic manifestations, most often HUS. Chronic colonization with the post-symptomatic shedding of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> O157: H7 may continue to occur, leading to a persistent risk of transmission and re-infection.</p>

      <sec id="article-20825.s8" sec-type="History and Physical">
        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>Patients will classically present with acute onset of bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramping,&#x000a0;usually without fever. Diarrhea initially may not be bloody, often being watery in consistency. Most patients will not manifest a temperature during the initial presentation and evaluation.&#x000a0;As a result of nausea, vomiting, and profuse diarrhea, patients will often note dehydration, asthenia, and decreased urine output. Patient history should include assessment of risk factors including (1) consumption of raw or undercooked meats or dairy products, especially unpasteurized milk, (2) exposure to ruminant animals or petting zoos, and (3) exposure to other farm scenarios.</p>
        <p>Abdominal tenderness on physical examination reflects <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> 0157: H7 Shiga toxin-induced intestinal vasculitis and inflammation. The abdominal discomfort from enterohemorrhagic <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> generally manifests more severely than other forms of enteritis as a result of the hemorrhagic vasculitis. Systemic signs of dehydration such as dry mucous membranes, tachycardia, decreased skin turgor, slow capillary refill, cold extremities, and delirium, presage worsened morbidity, particularly in children.</p>

      <sec id="article-20825.s9" sec-type="Evaluation">
        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>Initial laboratory evaluation should include a complete blood count to rule out leukocytosis, hemolysis, and thrombocytopenia. A complete metabolic profile will aid in ruling out dehydration, electrolyte disturbance, and uremia. The majority of patients with E. coli 0157:H7 colitis will have a leukocytosis above 10,000/microL. Initial diagnosis of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> O157: H7 utilizes the stool culture of a diarrheal sample within the first days after onset. Most cultures positive for <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> 0157:H7 will come from patients complaining of hemorrhagic diarrhea or grossly bloody diarrheal samples. Despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation that all diarrheal samples submitted for culture undergo screening for <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> O157: H7, many laboratories will not routinely screen for this organism necessitating the clinician to request testing for E. coli 0157:H7 specifically. Culture the diarrheal specimen with sorbitol MacConkey agar, which allows for differentiation of non-pathogenic <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> from pathogenic <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> O157 based on the latter&#x02019;s inability to metabolize sorbitol. Diagnostic confirmation utilizes testing for the presence of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> O157: H7 antigens in the stool or toxin genes with polymerase chain reaction. Commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays can detect Shiga toxins in hemorrhagic stool samples.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20825.r7">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20825.r8">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20825.r9">[10]</xref></p>

        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>Treatment of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> 0157: H7 gastrointestinal infection focuses on supportive care and maintenance of hydration status. Most enterohemorrhagic <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> diarrheal patients recover without treatment within ten days other than fluid replacement. Antibiotic therapy has not had a beneficial effect in speeding resolution or preventing complications from <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> 0157: H7; additionally, evidence exists that antibiotics worsen outcomes by increasing the likelihood of development of HUS, possibly secondary to antibiotic-induced lysis of infectious organisms with the sudden release of Shiga toxin into the systemic circulation. Patients with severe manifestations of HUS may benefit from hemodialysis to treat volume, electrolyte, and uremia issues related to acute renal failure. Limited data suggest that the monoclonal antibody eculizumab may expedite recovery from <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> 0157: H7 HUS. Eculizumab acts by inhibiting the complement cascade, thereby interfering with the recruitment of inflammatory cells and attenuating damage to the renal vasculature. Notably, eculizumab, an extremely expensive pharmaceutical with a primary indication for treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hematuria, lacks clinical consensus for the treatment of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> O157 associated HUS and typically gets utilized as a rescue agent in the sickest patients. Antiperistaltic agents, such as loperamide or dicyclomine, slow intestinal motility, and increase the risk of systemic complications; clinicians should avoid their utilization in this setting.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20825.r3">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20825.r10">[11]</xref></p>

        <p>The differentiation of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> O157: H7 from other invasive intestinal bacterial pathogens inducing hemorrhagic dysenteries such as Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, and <italic toggle="yes">C. difficile</italic> has a meaningful clinical impact in that antibiotic therapy often aids in recovery from these other pathogens.

        <title>Prognosis</title>
        <p>Enterohemorrhagic <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> colitis has a good prognosis for recovery when patients do not have systemic manifestations of diarrheal illness. HUS complicates up to 10% of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> 0157:H7 cases, with higher risk reported for younger children, especially those under 5 years old. When patients develop HUS complications, the risk of mortality approaches 5%.</p>

        <title>Complications</title>
        <p>Although most with enterohemorrhagic diarrhea-associated HUS recover from the acute illness episode, these patients have the potential for persistent, long-term renal dysfunction and extrarenal complications, including seizures, diabetes, chronic colitis, and hypertension. HUS, the most frequent, severe complication of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> O157: H7 colitis, occurs most commonly in children, especially young children less than 5 years old, and in the elderly. HUS manifests 5 to 10 days following the onset of hemorrhagic diarrhea and presents with the triad: hemolytic anemia, acute kidney failure, and thrombocytopenia. Approximately 10% of children with an <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> O157: H7 infection will develop HUS, which carries an annual 5% mortality rate, and those who survive have an increased risk for developing chronic kidney disease. Shiga toxin enterohemorrhagic-induced HUS in the elderly causes significant morbidity and mortality.&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> 0157:H7 infections result in healthcare costs in the United States of over US$ 400 million annually. As 10% of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> 0157:H7 hemorrhagic colitis cases progress to HUS with worsened prognosis, prevention of Shiga toxin enterohemorrhagic infections would improve health outcomes and reduce healthcare expenditures.</p>

        <title>Consultations</title>
        <p>Nephrology consultation has merit if patients develop HUS, as up to 50% require hemodialysis if acute renal impairment occurs.

        <title>Deterrence and Patient Education</title>
        <p>Potential means of preventing HUS include minimizing fecal Shiga toxin enterohemorrhagic shedding in animals and transmission of infection to humans. Public health measures to safeguard food and water from contamination remain essential in addition to personal hygiene and special care of food preparation and storage. Preventing the spread of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> 0157:H7 hemorrhagic colitis includes isolation of potentially infectious contacts in school or within institutions to minimize infectious transmission. Ample evidence suggests that personal hygiene, particularly handwashing, effectively prevents infectious acquisition and spread of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> 0157:H7 infections in the community, thereby altering the risk of HUS. Public health education, guidelines, and legislation to safeguard food and water against Shiga toxin enterohemorrhagic <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> food and water contamination and to ensure safe food production, preparation, and storage of food will benefit society as a whole. &#x000a0;Research investigating altering bovine intestinal conditions with different feeds as a means of reducing fecal <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> 0157:H7 shedding has demonstrated that cattle fed hay rather than grain for a brief period before slaughter has reduced fecal shedding of pathogenic <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>. Developing a human vaccine to prevent enterohemorrhagic E. coli infection may eventually provide herd immunity, protect against HUS, and provide value in low-income, high-risk dysentery settings.</p>
