        <p>Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a diverse collection of hematologic neoplasms characterized as a clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem cells, resulting in dysplasia and ineffective hematopoiesis within the bone marrow. This condition often leads to various degrees of cytopenias, which can manifest as anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia. Some individuals with MDS may progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), further complicating their clinical course. The prognosis for patients with MDS is highly variable and is influenced by factors such as cytogenetic abnormalities and the severity of cytopenias. Specifically, patients exhibiting the 5q chromosomal deletion tend to have a more favorable prognosis compared to those with monosomy 7, necessitating careful monitoring and tailored management strategies.</p>
        <p>Participants in this course gain a comprehensive understanding of the etiology, presentation, and management strategies for myelodysplastic syndrome. They learn about the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) and its revised version (R-IPSS), which serve as essential tools for risk stratification and treatment planning. Emphasis is placed on the importance of collaboration among an interprofessional team, including hematologists, nurses, and mental health professionals, to optimize patient care. Such teamwork enhances communication, fosters shared decision-making, and ensures a holistic approach to managing the complexities of MDS, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of hematologic neoplasms classically described as a clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem cells leading to dysplasia and ineffective hematopoiesis in the bone marrow (see <bold>Image.</bold> Underlying Myelodysplastic Syndrome). Some patients with MDS may have a transformation into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). MDS is usually diagnosed in older patients (eg, aged 65 and older). Clinical manifestations&#x000a0;include decreased red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells. The disease course is variable. Not all patients require treatment initially, as there is no survival benefit with the treatment of asymptomatic, low-risk patients.&#x000a0;Treatment&#x000a0;is reserved for patients who are symptomatic, such as those requiring frequent blood transfusions. Prognosis and overall survival depend upon&#x000a0;multiple factors, such as the severity of&#x000a0;cytopenias, the percentage of blasts in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, and karyotype.</p>

        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>MDS is a clonal disorder of myeloid stem cells that may occur de novo or secondary to various insults to the bone marrow. Various environmental and iatrogenic etiologies have been implicated in MDS, including exposure to chemotherapy (alkylating agents in particular), radiation, or environmental toxins such as benzene. Familial MDS has been reported but is a rare entity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The actual preceding factor(s) for de novo MDS is not entirely understood but assumed to occur from an oncogenic process resulting in 1 or more somatic&#x000a0;mutations. Over recent years, we have gained much insight into mutations commonly altered in MDS due to advances and rapid availability of gene sequencing. With these developments, researchers can identify 1 or more driver mutations in up to 80% to 90% of patients with some of the most common mutations, including <italic toggle="yes">SF3B1, TET2, SRSF2, ASXL1, DNMT3A, RUNX1, U2AF1, TP53</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">EZH2.</italic>
<italic toggle="yes">RUNX1, </italic>for example, is a mutation noted to disrupt normal hematopoiesis. More than 100 genes are recurrently mutated in MDS, and these encode spliceosome&#x000a0;components, chromatin remodeling factors, epigenetic pattern modulators, and transcription factors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r2">[2]</xref> These driver mutations have been found to correlate with different clinical features, including the severity of&#x000a0;cytopenias, blast percentage, cytogenetics, and overall survival. Of note, genetic mutations are not included in prognostic scoring systems for MDS, but&#x000a0;they have been found to influence overall survival in some cases. <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>, for example, is a tumor suppressor gene with a poor prognosis compared to other mutations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>MDS may be de novo or related to prior use of chemotherapeutic agents, also known as treatment-related MDS (t-MDS). This entity&#x000a0;is associated with a poor prognosis compared to de novo MDS and typically occurs&#x000a0;5 to&#x000a0;7 years after the use of chemotherapeutic agents. Alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide have been associated with this type of&#x000a0;MDS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;t-MDS is commonly associated&#x000a0;with chromosome 5 or 7 monosomies and complex cytogenetics. This type of&#x000a0;MDS also commonly transforms into AML. Results from a retrospective review of 112 patients with t-MDS showed that 55% transformed into acute myeloid leukemia,&#x000a0;while de novo MDS transforms into AML only around 30% of the time. The median overall survival for secondary or treatment-related MDS is around 30 weeks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r4">[4]</xref></p>

        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>The incidence of de novo MDS in the United States varies, but the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database from 2007 through 2011 estimates incidences around 4.9 per 100,000 persons and around 20,541 new cases annually. The incidence of MDS increases with age, with most cases occurring after age 65 and most frequently seen in patients over 80 years old, with a rate of 58 per 100,000. This is usually seen more in men and White individuals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r4">[4]</xref></p>

        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>Development of MDS may occur due to various mechanisms such as environmental exposures to chemicals like benzene, radiation, prior exposure to chemotherapeutic agents, or may be idiopathic, which is typically seen in the elderly population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Bone marrow failure syndromes like acquired aplastic anemia and Fanconi anemia have a risk of developing MDS and sometimes mimic this syndrome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;MDS can be de novo or secondary to other causes, also known as treatment-related MDS. Chemotherapeutic agents such as alkylators or topoisomerase II inhibitors have been implicated as known causes of MDS, usually occurring 2 to 7 years after exposure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>The mechanism for&#x000a0;the development&#x000a0;of MDS has been implicated by various genetic and chromosomal abnormalities, which may occur de novo or secondary to&#x000a0;1 of the above etiologies.&#x000a0;Cytogenetic abnormalities are seen in more than 80% of patients, including translocations or, more commonly, aneuploidy (loss or gain of a chromosome).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Changes in cytogenetics play a large role in the International Prognostic Scoring System. Deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q) is the most common abnormal karyotype and may be subdivided into 2 categories: treatment-related MDS with 5q deletion, usually with exposure to alkylating agents, versus de novo isolated 5q deletion. Patients with 5q deletion related to prior chemotherapeutic agents usually also have other cytogenetic abnormalities and/or <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations and usually portend a poor prognosis. Isolated 5q deletion without other cytogenetic abnormalities has a significantly better prognosis. Other cytogenetic abnormalities commonly studied include&#x000a0;normal karyotype, deletion 7q (-7), trisomy 8, and -Y.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r9">[9]</xref></p>

        <title>Histopathology</title>
        <p>A complete blood count evaluation usually reveals anemia or pancytopenia. A bone marrow biopsy and aspirate are usually performed after excluding other causes of their cytopenias. There is no histopathologic feature that defines MDS but rather a constellation of findings from the peripheral blood and bone marrow that meet the accepted criteria for diagnosis. Additional diagnostic workup includes flow cytometry immunophenotyping, cytogenetics with karyotype, fluorescent in situ hybridization, and genetic profiling to assess for relevant somatic mutations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>During the evaluation of a bone marrow biopsy, a pathologist determines marrow cellularity, the number of blasts, dysplasia of the megakaryocyte lineage, the presence of&#x000a0;ring sideroblasts by iron stains, fibrosis, as well as exclusion of metastases from outside the bone marrow. Bone marrow evaluation is performed using Giemsa and iron stains. The bone marrow is typically normocellular or hypercellular, though it can be hypocellular. Dysplasia in more than 10% of a single-cell lineage is part of the diagnostic criteria for MDS and can be seen in red cell precursors, granulocytes, and/or megakaryocytes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Morphologically, in the erythroid lineage, dyserythropoietic changes and ring sideroblasts may be evident by iron stain.&#x000a0;Iron staining with Prussian blue reaction is performed to evaluate for ring sideroblasts, which are described as a ring of iron-laden mitochondria around the nucleus of erythroid progenitors.&#x000a0;</p>

        <p>Patients with MDS may be clinically asymptomatic for years and may have incidental findings of cytopenias on routine labs. Others may present signs and symptoms of bone marrow failure, such as fatigue, bleeding, or infections. These symptoms may be gradual and progress&#x000a0;with time. Anemia is the most common clinical manifestation, and patients may complain of fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness.

        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>MDS may be suspected if one or more cytopenias are apparent. Per the International Working Group guidelines for MDS, there are 2 prerequisite criteria for diagnosis: (1) stable cytopenia for 6 months or longer, or 2 months if a certain karyotype or bilineage dysplasia is apparent, and (2) exclusion of other causes of dysplasia and/or cytopenia(s).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Anemia is the most common manifestation of MDS, which may be normocytic or macrocytic.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Evaluation of other potential causes of anemia should be performed with additional laboratory testing, including iron and ferritin levels, B12 and folate levels, hemolysis work-up with lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin and Coombs testing, and serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation as part of multiple myeloma work-up, if clinically applicable.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;Zinc and copper deficiencies are rare nutritional causes of anemia that can mimic MDS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;Macrocytosis is commonly seen in MDS but is usually not responsive to B12 or folate replacement. Neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia may also be apparent with anemia or later in the disease course. Initial evaluation includes a complete blood count with differential, a peripheral blood smear, and any other laboratory investigation that would be clinically relevant. A diagnostic evaluation should also include a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate, flow cytometry immunophenotyping, evaluation of cytogenetics by karyotype and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH, along with genetic profiling (performed with genomic profiling) to assess for relevant somatic mutations such as <italic toggle="yes">SF3B1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">TET2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">SRSF2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ASXL1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">DNMT3A</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">RUNX1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">U2AF1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">EZH2</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>On the peripheral blood smear, there are decreased numbers of 1 or more cell lines (red cells, platelets, or neutrophils). Neutrophils may be hypogranular and have hyposegmented neutrophils (pseudo-Pelger-Huet anomaly), and platelets may be larger and lack granules. Myeloblasts, or blasts, are immature myeloid progenitors that are rarely seen in the peripheral blood and, if seen, should also raise suspicion for acute myeloid leukemia. A bone marrow biopsy, which is required for diagnosis, is typically cellular or hypercellular, with dysplasia in 1 or more cell lines. A small number of patients may have hypoplastic bone marrow with MDS, but this is less common.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r6">[6]</xref></p>

        <p>A pathologist uses Giemsa and iron staining to examine the peripheral blood and marrow smears. When evaluating the bone marrow, greater than 10% dysplasia of granulocytic cells is required to diagnose MDS. Quantifying the number of blasts in the peripheral blood and bone marrow is also important. Myeloblasts, or blasts of the myeloid lineage, can be described as cells with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasm ratio, fine nuclear chromatin, and visible nucleoli, with or without granules. Auer rods are pink rod-like structures in the cytoplasm, which are&#x000a0;pathognomonic for myeloblasts. Myeloblasts should only account for less than 20% of nucleated cells in the bone marrow. If the percentage is above 20%, this would be considered acute myeloid leukemia. Iron staining with Prussian blue reaction is performed to evaluate for ring sideroblasts, which are described as a ring of iron-laden mitochondria around the nucleus of erythroid progenitors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>Cytogenetic analysis by FISH is also typically done to identify chromosomal abnormalities, which can influence prognosis and treatment; this also helps determine clonality. While a normal karyotype does not rule out MDS, around half of patients have some cytogenetic abnormality. MDS is typically associated with aneuploidy, while translocations are less common. The most frequently observed alterations include del(5q), monosomy 7 or del(7q), trisomy 8, and del(20q). Deletion of the long arm of 5, or del(5q), is associated with a better prognosis and responsiveness to lenalidomide, one of the treatments for MDS, compared to others. The WHO MDS classifications list MDS with isolated 5q as one of the categories. This category is isolated del(5q) and can include one other cytogenetic abnormality except for monosomy 7 or del(7q).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Some cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with prior exposure to chemotherapeutic agents. Deletion of all or part of chromosomes 5 and 7 has been associated with prior use of alkylating chemotherapeutic agents such as cyclophosphamide. Translocation of 11q23 is usually seen in patients with prior exposure to topoisomerase II inhibitors such as doxorubicin and is commonly associated with p53 mutations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>Somatic mutations have recently proven to be vital in understanding the underlying pathophysiology of MDS. They also have been shown to correlate with survival in some cases. Hundreds of mutations have been implicated in MDS, and a mutation can be found in 80% to 90% of patients. There is an overlap of mutations shared with AML. The most common mutations include <italic toggle="yes">TET2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">SF3B1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ASXL1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">DNMT3A</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">SRSF2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">RUNX1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">U2AF1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">EZH2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ZRSR2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">STAG2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CBL</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">NRAS</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">JAK2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">SETBP1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">IDH1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">IDH2</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">ETV6. </italic>These mutations are also associated with various clinical features. <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>, for example, carries a poor prognosis and is associated with a higher blast percentage in the bone marrow and worse thrombocytopenia; this is also associated with complex cytogenetics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r8">[8]</xref></p>

        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>The mainstay of treatment for MDS involves the assessment of symptoms and potential morbidity attributed to the disease. Patients do not always require treatment as long as they are asymptomatic, and most can be treated with supportive measures such as intermittent blood or platelet transfusions. MDS often portends an indolent or gradual course, though some patients have risk factors that put them at risk for transformation into AML. Oncologists use the IPSS or R-IPSS scoring system to help guide the course of treatment. Treatment options include supportive measures, low-intensity treatment with systemic agents, or high-intensity treatment such as allogeneic stem cell transplant. The only curative modality remains an allogeneic stem cell transplant, but this is often difficult as MDS occurs more commonly in the older adult population. Candidates for allogeneic stem cell transplant must be carefully selected, as the transplant process itself can be morbid for patients with potentially significant treatment-related mortality, especially in the older adult population. However, patients who are high-risk and&#x000a0;can undergo transplants have around 50% survival at 3 years. Treatment decisions are often individualized to each patient and based upon potential morbidity and mortality from treatment. Patients in intermediate or high-risk categories are generally considered for treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <p>MDS has proven to be refractory to cytotoxic chemotherapy, but there has been some&#x000a0;success with the use of hypomethylating agents and lenalidomide. High-risk and some intermediate-risk individuals are often considered for allogeneic stem cell transplant or systemic treatment. Those with low-risk cases may be managed with supportive measures such as transfusions or hematopoietic growth factors, though they may be&#x000a0;offered treatment with systemic agents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <p>Hematopoietic growth factors may be used in low-risk individuals with mild pancytopenia and low requirements for transfusion. In these patients, erythropoietin (EPO) levels should be measured. If the level is less than 500 mU/mL, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) such as agents such as recombinant human erythropoietin or darbepoetin may be given with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF). G-CSF does not appear to affect survival but may have a synergistic effect with EPO agents to effectively improve anemia with improvement in anemia in 40% to 60% of patients. Suppose serum EPO level is greater than 500 mU/mL, in that case, patients may be considered for treatment with immunosuppressive agents such as anti-thymocyte globulin +/- cyclosporine or one of the hypomethylating agents, as ESAs are unlikely to improve anemia in this subset&#x000a0;of patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Lenalidomide, a thalidomide derivative, is an agent used in patients with symptomatic anemia and deletion 5q (+/- one other cytogenetic abnormality except monosomy 7) in a low or intermediate risk category. This oral agent is given daily, with responses typically noted after 3 months of treatment; this often allows patients to become independent of blood transfusions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <p>Azacitidine and decitabine are pyrimidine analogs classified as hypomethylating agents or epigenetic modifiers. Low doses of these medications have been shown to aid in allowing the differentiation of blasts into mature cells. These agents are given monthly and generally&#x000a0;require several months before assessing response. Treatment is usually continued for a prolonged period though patients often have progression of their disease and experience worsening of cytopenias.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <p>Data to support the usage of these drugs has been gained from the results of prospective randomized trials and retrospective data. Azacitidine has been shown to improve both cytopenias and survival, especially for those with high-risk MDS. A large randomized phase 3 trial, which randomized patients to azacitidine (75 mg/m subcutaneous or intravenously daily for 7 days every 28 days) versus supportive measures or conventional care (low dose cytarabine or intensive chemotherapy), had results showing that 50.8% survival at 2 years in the azacitidine group compared to the conventional care group. Results also showed the potential to delay progression to AML, compared to supportive care. Results from another crossover trial assigned patients to supportive care or azacitidine with complete and partial remission rates of 60% versus 5% in the supportive care group. Patients receiving azacitidine also required fewer transfusions. Of note, azacitidine may achieve a duration of response of around 15 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>Decitabine is a closely related hypomethylating agent that can be given intravenously daily over 3 to 10 days every 28 days. This drug offers 30% to 50% response rates and is thought to be more potent than azacitidine. One randomized trial compared decitabine to supportive care and provided results that showed improvement in progression-free survival but no difference in overall survival. There have been no cross-comparisons of these 2 hypomethylating agents at the current time.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r5">[5]</xref></p>

        <title>Prognosis</title>
        <p>The prognosis of patients with MDS varies widely depending upon several characteristics, including cytogenetics and severity of cytopenias. Patients with 5q- generally&#x000a0;have a much better prognosis compared to MDS with monosomy 7, for example. The IPSS and revised IPSS are risk stratification systems clinicians use to guide treatment and the potential clinical course. These systems can be used in addition to a clinical patient assessment, including age and co-morbidities, to determine the best therapeutic options. The IPSS includes&#x000a0;the percentage of blasts in the bone marrow, karyotype, and the number of cell lineages with cytopenias. Karyotypes with a good prognosis include normal karyotype -Y, deletion 5q, and deletion 20q. Poor risk karyotypes include complex cytogenetics (greater than&#x000a0;3 abnormalities) or chromosome 7 abnormalities. All other karyotypes are categorized as intermediate risk. Based on these findings, a score is calculated to determine a risk score of either low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2, or high risk.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <p>The R-IPSS, which risk stratifies patients based on cytogenetics and blast percentage and has separate scores for absolute neutrophil count, hemoglobin value, and platelet value and has been shown to better predict outcomes than the older IPSS. For example, patients in a very&#x000a0;high-risk category for R-IPSS have a median overall survival of 0.8 years, compared to very low-risk individuals with a median overall survival of 8.8 years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r12">[12]</xref></p>
        <p>Those patients who&#x000a0;are classified as high-risk or have an unfavorable prognosis probably require treatment and may be considered for an allogeneic stem cell transplant to maintain their remission. However, even favorable risk patients with MDS may still have considerable morbidity and mortality from their disease. About a third of patients also have transformation into AML, and these patients often have a very poor prognosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Patients with isolated 5q deletion might experience longer survival than other types of MDS, with one study&#x000a0;noting&#x000a0;5-year survival of 40% if they did not receive treatment and 54% if they received treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25435.r13">[13]</xref></p>

        <p>Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of hematologic neoplasms classically described as a clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem cells leading to dysplasia and ineffective hematopoiesis in the bone marrow. Because of the diverse presentation and complex management, this syndrome is best managed by an interprofessional team of clinicians that includes a hematologist, oncologist, internist, infectious disease specialist, and a geneticist. The prognosis for patients with MDS varies, depending on the severity and type of cytogenetic defect. Karyotypes with a good prognosis include normal karyotype -Y, deletion 5q, and deletion 20q. Poor risk karyotypes include complex cytogenetics (greater than&#x000a0;3 abnormalities) or chromosome 7 abnormalities.&#x000a0;All other karyotypes are categorized&#x000a0;as intermediate risk.
