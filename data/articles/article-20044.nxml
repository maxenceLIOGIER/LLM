        <p>Corticosteroid-induced myopathy is an iatrogenic myopathy caused by chronic high to moderate systemic corticosteroid use. This is a common condition that must be differentiated from other iatrogenic and organic causes of myopathy. Diagnosis is based on a high degree of clinical suspicion in patients on chronic steroids; prompt initiation of treatment in the form of corticosteroid withdrawal, if possible, should be initiated to avoid the morbidity associated with the condition. This activity reviews the characteristics, evaluation, and management of corticosteroid-induced myopathy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Corticosteroid-induced myopathy&#x000a0;is a highly prevalent toxic noninflammatory&#x000a0;myopathy that occurs as an adverse effect of&#x000a0;prolonged&#x000a0;oral or intravenous glucocorticoid use. It was first described in&#x000a0;1932 by Harvey Cushing as part of a constellation of symptoms seen in Cushing syndrome. With the broader use of corticosteroids as therapeutic tools in the 1950s, corticosteroid-induced myopathy became a more well-known entity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;This toxic noninflammatory myopathy typically has an indolent presentation and predominantly affects pelvic girdle muscles, and is associated with muscle weakness and atrophy without associated pain. Acute steroid-induced myopathy in the critical care setting is another presentation. Workup typically reveals normal creatine kinase and no other signs of inflammatory disease, with EMG studies&#x000a0;unremarkable and biopsy showing atrophy of type 2b fast-twitch muscle fibers. The diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and is confirmed when muscle weakness improves after 3 to 4 weeks of tapering steroids, although improvement may take months to a year.&#x000a0;Other than steroid withdrawal, other options include switching from fluorinated to nonfluorinated glucocorticoids or alternate day dosing. Additionally, physical therapy in the form of resistance and aerobic exercise has been shown in some studies to prevent and treat steroid-induced myopathy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;As such, a screening program for steroid-induced myopathy should be implemented in the appropriate patient population, and patients should be prescribed physical therapy as a preventive and treatment modality for this condition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r4">[4]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-20044.s3" sec-type="Etiology">
        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>Corticosteroid-induced myopathy is a toxic noninflammatory myopathy caused by exogenous corticosteroid administration. The condition typically develops with doses higher than 10 mg prednisone equivalents/day used for four weeks or longer. However, 2 to 3 weeks of higher doses (such as 40 to 60 mg prednisone/day) have been associated with more acute presentations. Oral and intravenous formulations are most associated with corticosteroid myopathy, although case reports exist regarding steroid myopathy following inhaled corticosteroids and epidural, intramuscular, or intra-articular injection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;For patients in the intensive care setting undergoing mechanical ventilation and&#x000a0;receiving curare-like paralytics, doses of methylprednisolone greater than 60 mg/day for 5 to 7 days are also associated with acute steroid myopathy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r5">[5]</xref></p>

        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>Corticosteroid-induced myopathy is the most common drug-induced myopathy, with an incidence of 50% to 60% among those using corticosteroids for a prolonged period.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;While any individual on chronic corticosteroids can be affected, elderly patients are most at risk due to lower baseline muscle mass, as are patients with oncologic diseases. Additional risk factors for corticosteroid-induced myopathy include patients with prior muscle disease or spinal cord injury, chronic respiratory illness, poor nutritional status, and a sedentary lifestyle.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Women are more prone to developing corticosteroid-induced myopathy, although the mechanism of this is unclear.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;In the acute illness setting, patients on mechanical ventilation who receive neuromuscular blockade with curare-like agents and receive high-dose steroids are also at high risk for developing acute steroid-induced myopathy, which may take weeks to recover.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Of note, case reports do exist of nonventilated patients experiencing acute early-onset steroid myopathy (defined as less than 2 weeks from the start of treatment), even with moderate steroid doses and unusual muscle involvement, such as the vocal cords.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Thus, the epidemiology of the condition is highly variable.</p>

        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>Corticosteroid-induced myopathy is believed to occur through both catabolic and anti-anabolic mechanisms. In terms of catabolic mechanisms, corticosteroids upregulate proteolytic systems such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system, cathepsins (lysosomes), and calpains (calcium-dependent systems). This increases the proteolysis of myofibrillar proteins by dissociating actin from myosin.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;Corticosteroids also induce myocyte apoptosis through&#x000a0;receptor-based signaling pathways as well as mitochondrial-based signaling pathways involving cytochrome c and the caspase cascade.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;In terms of anti-anabolic mechanisms, corticosteroids inhibit amino acid transport into cells, inhibit muscle IGF-I production, and down-regulate differentiation of satellite cells into muscle fibers by blocking the transcription factor called myogenin, thus&#x000a0;inhibiting protein synthesis and myogenesis. Additionally, corticosteroids with high mineralocorticoid activity lower serum potassium and phosphate, which may contribute to muscle weakness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r5">[5]</xref></p>

        <p>Muscle biopsy, if performed,&#x000a0;reveals atrophy of type 2b or fast-twitch muscle fibers, with less impact on type 1 or slow-twitch muscle fibers, with variability in fiber size and centralization of nuclei, without evidence of inflammation or necrosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;The preferential atrophy of type 2b fibers, which have high glycolytic and low oxidative capacity, supports the predominant involvement of extremity&#x000a0;skeletal muscles rather than respiratory muscles<bold>.</bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r7">[7]</xref></p>

        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>Symptoms of corticosteroid-induced myopathy consist of muscle weakness, typically in a symmetric distribution involving the proximal extremity muscles, with the hip girdle affected more and earlier than the shoulders. It is associated with long-term&#x000a0;muscle atrophy, notably with very minimal or no associated pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r10">[10]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;Onset is typically insidious, with the range being weeks to months from initiation of corticosteroids. Patients often complain of difficulty rising from a seated position, climbing stairs, and trouble with overhead activities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;History invariably includes ongoing oral or intravenous corticosteroid use, particularly prolonged fluorinated glucocorticoid exposure. It is important to observe that higher doses are more likely to induce clinical myopathy. On physical exam, in one study, up to 20% of patients show objective signs of muscle weakness, although a subjective feeling of weakness occurs in 60%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r13">[13]</xref>&#x000a0;The remainder of the physical exam can reveal decreased muscle stretch reflexes in the affected extremities. However, there are no sensory&#x000a0;or neurological deficits that would point to a central nervous/spinal cord etiology and no cranial nerve involvement.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;Patients may have additional sequelae&#x000a0;of chronic glucocorticoid administration, including&#x000a0;Cushing syndrome stigmata, such as moon facies and fat redistribution. They may have metabolic complications, including obesity, diabetes, adrenal insufficiency, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, skin, and bone disorders, including osteoporosis and avascular necrosis. Other complications of chronic steroid use include increased susceptibility to infection, gastritis, cataracts, glaucoma, and mood/neurocognitive side effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;Thus, patients may present with&#x000a0;several complications of chronic steroid use.</p>

        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>Corticosteroid-induced myopathy is a clinical diagnosis that requires a high index of suspicion. Labwork including creatine kinase (CK), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and aldolase are typically normal, although these may be elevated very early in the disease process or acute steroid myopathy of critically ill patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;Muscle biopsy is not required for diagnosis, although, when performed, it may show nonspecific type 2b muscle fiber atrophy without inflammatory infiltrate, with variable fiber size and centrally located nuclei; necrosis&#x000a0;is rare.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;The unremarkable lab and biopsy findings help differentiate corticosteroid-induced myopathy from other inflammatory myopathies. EMG findings are typically normal, with an occasional slight reduction in the amplitude of the motor unit potentials. This occurs as&#x000a0;EMG measures both type 1 and type 2 fiber activity and does not differentiate in the preferential atrophy of type 2b muscle fibers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;Imaging, including MRI, is rarely performed for corticosteroid-induced myopathy except when evaluating for alternate diagnoses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Sometimes, in patients on steroids for inflammatory myopathy, it is difficult to distinguish the muscle weakness arising from the worsening of the underlying myopathy from the symptoms arising from the newly developing corticosteroid-induced myopathy. The determination of corticosteroid-induced myopathy is ultimately tested and confirmed when symptoms improve with tapering or discontinuing corticosteroids.</p>

        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>Corticosteroid-induced myopathy is&#x000a0;an often overlooked diagnosis, as symptoms are occasionally attributed to the primary illness that the corticosteroid is treating. This prolongs the time to diagnosis and increases morbidity. Thus, a high index of suspicion must be maintained when patients present with muscle weakness in any muscle group (with particular emphasis on pelvic girdle)&#x000a0;with&#x000a0;any dose, route, or duration of steroids.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Reduction or, ideally, discontinuation of the corticosteroid is the mainstay of treatment, with close monitoring for adrenal insufficiency and exacerbation of the primary illness during the discontinuation process. For patients unable to taper off steroids, replacement of fluorinated glucocorticoids with non-fluorinated glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone with prednisone or hydrocortisone, should be considered. Although the mechanism is unclear, fluorinated glucocorticoids are known to be&#x000a0;much more potent than non-fluorinated glucocorticoids, which may contribute to their higher toxicity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;For patients with primary brain tumors on the fluorinated glucocorticoid dexamethasone, the anticonvulsant phenytoin has been used&#x000a0;with dexamethasone to reduce the risk of developing corticosteroid-induced myopathy, as phenytoin is thought to help facilitate hepatic dexamethasone metabolism.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r14">[14]</xref>&#x000a0;Other options include non-daily dosing regimens.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;However, steroid-sparing treatments should be prioritized whenever possible.&#x000a0;Diagnosis is confirmed when muscle strength improves within 3 to 4 weeks of tapering steroids, although recovery may take months to a year.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20044.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;In addition to steroid withdrawal, supportive management with an emphasis on physical therapy should be considered for both prevention and treatment.
