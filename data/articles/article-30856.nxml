        <p>Urinary tract infections (UTIs) during pregnancy represent a common yet potentially serious complication, posing risks to both maternal and fetal health. Pregnancy induces anatomical and physiological changes that increase the susceptibility to UTIs, making it crucial to understand the unique dynamics of these infections in this population. Untreated UTIs can lead to complications such as pyelonephritis, preterm birth, low birth weight, and even maternal sepsis, highlighting the importance of prompt diagnosis and management.</p>
        <p>Participants&#x000a0;of this course will gain a deep understanding of UTIs in pregnancy, starting with an overview of the epidemiology and risk factors associated with this condition.&#x000a0;This review will explore the physiological changes that occur during pregnancy that predispose females to UTIs and discuss the clinical manifestations that may vary from asymptomatic bacteriuria to acute pyelonephritis. Diagnostic modalities, including urinalysis and urine culture interpretation, will be thoroughly examined to ensure accurate and timely diagnosis. Treatment options, including antibiotic selection and duration, will be discussed in light of their efficacy and safety during pregnancy. Strategies for preventing UTIs will be explored. This activity will highlight the significance of the interprofessional team, including obstetricians, midwives, nurses, and pharmacists, in managing UTIs in pregnancy.&#x000a0;</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>The anatomy of the urinary tract undergoes significant changes during pregnancy, with hormonal and mechanical factors contributing to ureteral dilation, dilation of the renal calyces, and urinary stasis,&#x000a0;all of which predispose pregnant patients to urinary tract infections (UTIs). Progesterone relaxes smooth muscles, and the gravid uterus compresses the bladder, decreasing bladder capacity. Vesicoureteral reflux, increased residual urine in the bladder, and urinary stasis&#x000a0;may be seen. Any of these changes lead to an increased risk of UTI in pregnancy.</p>
        <p>Typically, UTIs in pregnancy follow a predictable natural history, starting with asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), which, if left untreated, may progress to symptomatic infection, such as cystitis or pyelonephritis. The patterns of spread of UTIs in pregnancy often involve ascending infection from the lower urinary tract, facilitated by reduced urethral tone and altered bladder dynamics from pregnancy changes. Understanding these aspects is crucial for healthcare professionals to effectively recognize, diagnose, and manage UTIs in pregnancy, thereby preventing complications and ensuring optimal maternal and fetal outcomes.</p>

      <sec id="article-30856.s3" sec-type="Etiology">
        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>UTIs in pregnancy can arise from a variety of causes, primarily attributed to anatomical and physiological changes that occur during gestation. One significant factor is the hormonal changes, particularly the increase in progesterone levels, which leads to the relaxation of smooth muscle tissue throughout the urinary tract, including the ureters and bladder. This relaxation reduces ureteral tone and alters bladder dynamics, contributing to urinary stasis and making it easier for bacteria to ascend from the urethra to the bladder and, potentially, to the kidneys.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>Additionally, the enlarging uterus can mechanically obstruct the ureters and urinary flow, further predisposing pregnant women to UTIs. Hormonal changes also affect the vaginal flora, potentially increasing the colonization of uropathogens. Moreover, physiological changes in the immune system during pregnancy, such as a decrease in cell-mediated immunity, may impair the body's ability to combat bacterial infections effectively. Together, these factors create an environment conducive to the development of UTIs in pregnancy, highlighting the importance of proactive measures to prevent and manage these infections to safeguard maternal and fetal health.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r1">[1]</xref></p>

        <p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, various infections during pregnancy account for 10.7% of pregnancy-related maternal deaths worldwide. Recent studies estimate that most of these infections, almost 28%, are located in the urinary tract.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r2">[2]</xref> The most significant factor predisposing women to&#x000a0;cystitis and pyelonephritis in pregnancy may be ASB. ASB is defined as &#x0003e;100,000 organisms/mL on a clean catch urinalysis obtained from an asymptomatic patient.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r3">[3]</xref> If&#x000a0;ASB is untreated in pregnancy, the rate of subsequent UTI has been quoted at approximately 25%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>The rate of&#x000a0;ASB in non-pregnant women is 5% to 6%, which compares similarly to estimated rates in pregnancy of 2% to 10%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;ASB is seen&#x000a0;more frequently in parous women and women of low socioeconomic status. Women who are carriers of sickle cell trait also have a higher incidence of ASB.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>Due to both the high rate and potential seriousness of pyelonephritis, it is recommended by&#x000a0;most all prenatal guidelines that every pregnant person be screened for ASB&#x000a0;once early in prenatal care, either in the first or second trimester.&#x000a0;This is most often done with a clean catch urine culture. Previously, treatment of ASB was thought to decrease the rate of clinical infection to 3% to 4%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Interestingly, more recent studies do not provide evidence that treatment of ASB decreases rates of preterm birth and low birth weight. Further studies in this area are needed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r6">[6]</xref></p>
        <p>Cystitis occurs in 1% to 2% of pregnant individuals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Pyelonephritis also occurs in 1% to 2% of pregnant people, most commonly in the second trimester. Pyelonephritis is a common cause of serious infections, including septic shock, in pregnant patients. It is the cause of most medical hospitalizations during pregnancy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;In&#x000a0;1 study, 3.5% of antepartum admissions were due to UTI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;Risk factors for pyelonephritis in pregnancy include obesity, low socioeconomic status, young age, nulliparity, diabetes, smoking, and a history of recurrent UTIs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;As with ASB, some patients may be predisposed to infection and may report a history of having had ASB, cystitis, or pyelonephritis in the past. Pyelonephritis is most often right-sided, but it may be bilateral in up to 25% of cases.</p>

        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>Patients with&#x000a0;ASB have no symptoms; thus, it is important to screen for the disease early in pregnancy. These patients may have a history of frequent UTIs or may have experienced ASB in a prior pregnancy. It is reasonable to screen patients with sickle cell trait more frequently during pregnancy, although there is no standard recommendation as to the frequency of screening for UTI in pregnancy in these patients. Patients with spinal cord injuries or diabetes should not be screened more frequently, as this can do more harm.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r10">[10]</xref></p>
        <p>Cystitis presents with the same symptoms seen in non-pregnant individuals. Symptoms may include pain or burning with urination (dysuria in 55%), urinary frequency (82%), or urinary urgency. Suprapubic pain (73%) and tenderness may be noted. However, there is a high rate of false positives for these symptoms alone, as only 26% of women with symptoms have a positive urine culture result.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>Likewise, patients with pyelonephritis exhibit symptoms seen in non-pregnant patients with the same disease. Symptoms may include flank pain, fever of or above 38.0 &#x000b0;C, and chills. Nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting may be reported, thus the differential diagnosis on initial presentation is often broad. Differential diagnosis includes acute intraabdominal processes such as appendicitis, cholecystitis, and pancreatitis, as well as pregnancy-related complications, including preterm&#x000a0;labor and placental abruption.</p>
        <p>Patients may report contractions or&#x000a0;demonstrate contractions with uterine monitoring. This uterine activity is often due to smooth muscle irritability caused by infection. If contractions are felt or determined, patients should be assessed for cervical dilation. Patients should be monitored closely, as preterm labor may develop. Signs and symptoms of sepsis may be present, including tachycardia and hypotension. Such patients require prompt evaluation and interventions.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive physical examination is essential, focusing particularly on vital signs and assessing the heart and lungs. Additionally, an abdominal examination may uncover tenderness, while costovertebral tenderness is often detectable with pyelonephritis. Conducting a genitourinary examination to check for cervical infection and assess cervical dilation upon admission is important. Even if there are no immediate concerns about pregnancy complications, it is still advisable to monitor for contractions or any other abnormalities throughout the hospitalization period.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-30856.s7" sec-type="Evaluation">
        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>The evaluation of a pregnant patient with concerns for UTI will include a clean catch urinalysis and urine culture. A few considerations are noteworthy regarding the collection of urinary specimens during pregnancy. Well-hydrated patients may excrete dilute urine, rendering some assessed parameters less accurate. Hematuria may result from contamination,&#x000a0;particularly when specimens are collected from laboring or postpartum patients. Due to reduced protein reabsorption, small amounts of protein may normally be excreted. Contamination, as may occur with mucous vaginal discharge, may also contribute to the presence of&#x000a0;proteinaceous material in the urine of pregnant women.</p>
        <p>Urine dipstick screening during pregnancy shows a high false positive result for infection and is overall not beneficial. In symptomatic patients, the detection of nitrites showed notable significance, displaying a specificity of 98.6%, a negative predictive value of 81.9%, and a positive predictive value of 86.6%. Additionally, certain historical symptoms such as dysuria (specificity of 88%) and hematuria (specificity of 93%) proved effective in predicting UTIs confirmed by culture but were less reliable in excluding this condition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r11">[11]</xref></p>
        <p>There is also a high prevalence of contaminated urine cultures in pregnancy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;High BMI is associated with an increased risk of contamination of urine culture.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;Skin flora is commonly seen growing from urine cultures from pregnant women, and repeating the culture is futile. Interestingly, having the patient perform perineal cleaning, known as a clean catch, does not decrease the contamination compared to collecting&#x000a0;a midstream urine specimen without perineal cleaning. After a negative screening urine culture, the risk of pyelonephritis is low.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r13">[13]</xref></p>
        <p>When pyelonephritis is suspected in pregnancy, laboratory analysis should include a complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, and serum creatinine. Tailored studies should be included as appropriate to exclude other causes of patients' symptoms, such as amylase and lipase if pancreatitis is considered a diagnosis. If sepsis is suspected, lactic acid and blood cultures should be obtained. All cultures should be obtained as soon as possible and before starting antibiotic therapy.</p>
        <p>When the fetus is viable, fetal heart rate and contraction monitoring should occur. Consideration should be given to obtaining cervical and GBS cultures on admission in the event that pregnancy-related complications develop. Infrequently, renal ultrasound may be indicated to assess for a possible renal abscess.</p>

      <sec id="article-30856.s8" sec-type="Treatment / Management">
        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>ASB and acute cystitis in pregnancy are treated with oral antibiotic therapy. Treatment for UTI in pregnancy should be started when an asymptomatic patient has a single organism bacterial colony count of &#x02265;100,000 (10^5) CFU/mL in a urine culture. Per the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), with symptoms present, a UTI is confirmed with colony counts&#x000a0;of 100,000 (10^5)&#x000a0;CFU/mL of a single organism.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Empiric antibiotic therapy may be started if symptoms of UTI are present, including urinary frequency, dysuria, and hematuria. Antibiotic choice can be tailored based on organism sensitivities when available from urine culture results, which should be collected before initiating antibiotics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r14">[14]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r15">[15]</xref>&#x000a0;A 5- to 7-day course of antibiotics should be used.</p>
        <p>Amoxicillin and ampicillin should be avoided as empiric therapy, as there is high antibiotic resistance to these antibiotics from <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r1">[1]</xref> Antibiotics commonly used include cephalosporins, nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Fluoroquinolones are not recommended as a first-line treatment in pregnancy due to conflicting studies regarding teratogenicity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r16">[16]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r17">[17]</xref></p>
        <p>Recent evidence has developed suggesting a link between the use of sulfa derivatives and nitrofurantoin and congenital disabilities when these medications are prescribed in the first trimester. These studies have limitations; however, avoiding using these medications in the first trimester is recommended when alternatives are available.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r18">[18]</xref>&#x000a0;Because the potential consequences of untreated UTI in pregnancy are significant, it is reasonable to use these medications when needed as the benefit strongly outweighs the risk of use. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency should not be prescribed sulfa derivatives or nitrofurantoin, as these medications can precipitate hemolysis. In the late third trimester, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should be avoided if feasible due to the theoretical risk for the development of kernicterus in the infant following delivery.</p>
        <p>If GBS is noted in a urine culture with a colony count &#x0003e;100,000 CFU/mL, the pregnant patient should be treated with antibiotics per recommendations for UTI in pregnancy. However,&#x000a0;ACOG advises that colony counts of GBS &#x0003c;100,000 CFU/mL do not need to be treated. Patients with any amount of GBS found in the urine at any time during pregnancy should receive intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy during labor. This is to prevent the development of early-onset GBS sepsis, which may occur in infants of women who are colonized with GBS.</p>
        <p>Pyelonephritis in pregnancy is a serious condition usually requiring hospitalization. Once an evaluation has been completed, treatment consists primarily of directed antibiotic therapy and IV fluids to maintain adequate urine output. Fever should be treated with a cooling blanket and acetaminophen as needed.&#x000a0;Second or&#x000a0;third-generation&#x000a0;cephalosporins are commonly used for initial treatment, with an aminoglycoside being the second line.&#x000a0;Some authors prefer to use third-generation cephalosporins as third-line therapy due to the high risk of inducing antibiotic resistance with these medications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r15">[15]</xref> Ampicillin and gentamicin or other broad-spectrum antibiotics are alternatives. For patients who have had cephalosporin antibiotic-resistant pyelonephritis in the past, carbapenems are considered the first-line therapy. Second and third-line antibiotic choices in these cases include a fourth-generation cephalosporin or an aminoglycoside and piperacillin/tazobactam, respectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r15">[15]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Antibiotic choices for pyelonephritis in pregnancy may include the following:</bold>
</p>
        <p>1. Ceftriaxone or cefepime 1 g IV every 24 hours</p>
        <p>2. Ampicillin 2 g IV every 6 hours PLUS gentamycin 1.5 mg/kg IV every 8 hours (or 5 mg/kg IV every 24 hours)</p>
        <p>3. Aztreonam (for use in patients with &#x003b2;-lactam allergy) 1 g IV every 8 hours to 12 hours</p>

        <p>Cephalosporins are the most common antibiotics used for pregnant patients with UTIs; however, over&#x000a0;a quarter&#x000a0;of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> isolates have known resistance to third-generation cephalosporins. Women from lower-income countries are more commonly treated as outpatients for UTI during pregnancy, possibly because of low resources or fewer diagnoses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>Following the treatment of a UTI during pregnancy, there is limited guidance on the recommended management. It is suggested to consider obtaining a repeat urine culture 1 to 2 weeks after completion of the initial treatment. Alternatively, patients can be observed for symptoms, and a repeat culture may be obtained only if symptoms reappear. There is insufficient evidence supporting the use of daily prophylaxis with antibiotics after an episode of cystitis during pregnancy.</p>

        <title>Differential Diagnosis</title>
        <p>The differential diagnosis of UTIs in pregnancy encompasses various conditions that can present with similar symptoms, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate management. Among pregnant individuals, symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, urgency, and suprapubic pain may also be attributed to physiological changes related to pregnancy, such as increased urinary frequency due to pressure on the bladder from the enlarging uterus. Additionally, conditions such as pelvic inflammatory disease, vaginal infections, and sexually transmitted infections may mimic UTI symptoms in pregnancy.&#x000a0;More specifically, the differential diagnosis of pyelonephritis in pregnancy includes acute intraabdominal diseases such as appendicitis, pancreatitis, cholecystitis, and kidney stones, as well as pregnancy-related complications such as preterm labor, chorioamnionitis, or placental abruption.&#x000a0;</p>

        <title>Prognosis</title>
        <p>The prognosis of patients with UTIs in pregnancy largely depends on the promptness and effectiveness of diagnosis and treatment. Untreated or inadequately treated UTIs in pregnancy can lead to serious complications such as pyelonephritis, preterm birth, low birth weight, and maternal sepsis, which can significantly impact maternal and fetal health. However, with appropriate management, including timely administration of antibiotics and close monitoring, the prognosis for most pregnant individuals with UTIs is favorable.</p>
        <p>Since the 1960s and 1970s, when asymptomatic bacteria (ASB) began to be routinely tested for, the incidence of pyelonephritis in pregnancy decreased from 20% to 35% to 1% to 4%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r19">[19]</xref>&#x000a0;However, it is unclear if ASB treatment decreased the rates of preterm birth and low birth weight infants because many of these studies were done&#x000a0;more than 30 years ago. Therefore, recent studies have questioned the need for screening and treatment of ASB in pregnancy and found that the incidence of preterm birth and low birth weight infants may not be decreased by treatment of ASB in pregnancy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r6">[6]</xref></p>
        <p>Another important aspect to be mindful of is the overuse of antibiotics in pregnant women.

        <title>Complications</title>
        <p>Complications due to UTIs in pregnancy include sepsis, anemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, preterm contractions and labor, and renal abscess. Intensive care unit (ICU) admission may be required.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Studies indicate that 7.5% of patients with pyelonephritis have bacteria in the blood, 13.3% have sepsis, and 1.9% have septic shock. Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is not uncommon (6.3%), while preterm delivery (11%) and birth weight &#x0003c;2800 g (8.2%) are additional complications that may be seen due to UTI in pregnancy. Delivery within 72 hours has been noted in 7% of patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r21">[21]</xref></p>
        <p>Pulmonary complications are not uncommon, occurring in up to 10% of pregnant patients undergoing treatment for pyelonephritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r14">[14]</xref>&#x000a0;This is due to endotoxin-mediated alveolar damage and may manifest as pulmonary edema or ARDS. Urine output and oxygen status should be monitored closely, and patients may require ICU admission for respiratory support. Endotoxin release may lead to anemia, which typically resolves spontaneously following treatment. This is the most common complication seen with pyelonephritis, occurring in up to 25% of patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Endotoxin release may also cause uterine contractions, and patients should be monitored for preterm labor, preterm delivery, and PPROM.</p>
        <p>A small number of patients may experience persistent infection. In these&#x000a0;cases,&#x000a0;consideration should be given to urinary obstruction or renal abscess. Antibiotic choice should be reevaluated, and culture results should be reviewed. In 4% to 5% of pregnancies, 2 or more UTIs occur. This is known as recurrent UTIs in pregnancy. Data are limited regarding the management of recurrent UTIs in pregnancy. Insufficient evidence is available for recommendations after recurrent UTI treatment in pregnancy. Suppressive antibiotic therapy, either once daily or postcoitally with an antibiotic that the bacterial isolate was susceptible to, is commonly recommended in individuals who have had recurrent UTIs in pregnancy. This is typically continued throughout pregnancy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30856.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Examples of antibiotics used include nitrofurantoin 100 mg orally daily or cephalexin 250 mg to 500 mg by mouth daily.</p>

        <title>Deterrence and Patient Education</title>
        <p>Deterrence and prevention of UTIs in pregnancy are essential to safeguard the health of both the mother and the developing fetus. Strategies for deterrence include promoting optimal hygiene practices, such as frequent handwashing and proper perineal care, to minimize the risk of bacterial colonization and ascending infection. Additionally, encouraging pregnant individuals to maintain adequate hydration and empty their bladder regularly can help prevent urinary stasis and decrease the likelihood of UTIs. Preventive measures also involve screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria during prenatal visits and promptly treating positive cases to prevent progression to symptomatic infection. Education plays a key role in empowering pregnant individuals to recognize UTI symptoms and seek timely medical evaluation and treatment. Implementing evidence-based guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis in high-risk populations can further reduce the incidence of UTIs in pregnancy. By prioritizing preventive strategies and patient education, healthcare professionals&#x000a0;can mitigate the burden of UTIs in pregnancy and promote optimal maternal and fetal outcomes.</p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>Physicians, advanced care practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and other health professionals share responsibility for the comprehensive care of pregnant individuals with UTIs. This includes timely and accurate diagnosis, appropriate treatment initiation, patient education, monitoring for complications, and facilitating follow-up care. Physicians and advanced practitioners lead diagnosis and treatment, nurses provide patient education and monitoring, and pharmacists ensure&#x000a0;safe medication use.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The interprofessional healthcare team&#x000a0;should adopt evidence-based strategies for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of UTIs in pregnancy. This includes implementing screening protocols for asymptomatic bacteriuria, utilizing antimicrobial stewardship principles when prescribing antibiotics, and promoting patient education on hygiene and preventive measures. Developing standardized protocols and pathways for UTI management can ensure consistency and improve outcomes.</p>
        <p>Effective interprofessional communication is vital for optimizing patient-centered care and outcomes related to UTIs in pregnancy. Clinicians&#x000a0;should engage in open, respectful, and clear communication to ensure that relevant information is shared, treatment plans are coordinated, and patient preferences are considered. Interdisciplinary team meetings, case conferences, and electronic communication platforms facilitate seamless collaboration.</p>
        <p>Care coordination involves systematically organizing and integrating healthcare services to meet the complex needs of pregnant individuals with UTIs. The interprofessional team must work together to ensure continuity of care and facilitate smooth transitions between care settings. This includes coordinating appointments, referrals, laboratory tests, and consultations, as well as providing comprehensive support throughout the continuum of care. By prioritizing patient-centered care, outcomes, safety, and team performance can be enhanced, ultimately improving the overall quality of care for pregnant individuals with UTIs.</p>
