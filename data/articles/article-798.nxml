        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>The lungs are&#x000a0;1 of the few organ systems most challenged by stress due to their direct contact with the outside world.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29494033/">[1]</ext-link> Their well-equipped defense system significantly prevents disease development and ward off toxic insults such as smoke, exhaust, and microbes.&#x000a0;Depending on the location within the lung, several anatomical defenses are present to ward off harmful particles, such as dust, viruses, bacteria, fungi, and soot, among others. The size of each particle determines how the lungs defend themselves.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-798.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Along with these anatomical barriers, the integrated stress response (ISR) becomes activated by&#x000a0;1 or more toxic triggers, activating&#x000a0;1 of 4 stress-sensing kinases. The balance of these cytoprotective and damaging factors induced by the kinases leads to negative lung effects due to the environment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-798.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>

        <title>Issues of Concern</title>
        <p>The purpose of the pulmonary system is to bring oxygen in for use in bodily functions. At the same time, it introduces the body to several foreign particles.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-798.r3">[3]</xref> Although the ideal goal would be to ward off negative stressors, such as smoke, pollution, and microbes, to name a few, the reality is far from ideal. It is nearly impossible to escape the stressors that cause damage to the lungs. Humans are constantly surrounded by exhaust, pollution, smoke, and many pathogens. Therefore,&#x000a0;with exposure to a combination of these pathogens throughout life, a person may develop the disease even with these protective mechanisms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-798.r1">[1]</xref></p>

        <title>Cellular Level
</title>
        <p>Cilia are tiny hair-like projections lining the airway to protect the lungs from toxins. A thin mucus layer also covers them to help move the trapped particles toward expulsion via the cough reflex. Cilia are located in the upper airways, whereas alveolar macrophages are in the lower airways, taking care of smaller particles that the cilia and/or mucus may have missed. Alveolar macrophages are white blood cells that ingest and digest smaller particles, less than 2 micrometers. When many particles enter the lung, more&#x000a0;alveolar macrophages, including neutrophils, can be recruited if a bacterial infection is a concern.</p>
        <p>On a smaller scale, the ISR becomes activated by&#x000a0;1 or more toxic triggers. It thereby kicks off&#x000a0;1 of 4 stress-sensing kinases: heme-regulated inhibitor, protein kinase R, protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, and general control nonderepressible 2. A toxic insult activates each kinase: iron deficiency and oxidative stress activate heme-regulated inhibitors, dsDNA in viruses and bacteria activates protein kinase R, hypoxia, misfolded proteins activate protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, and amino acid starvation and UV light activate general control nonderepressible 2.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-798.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>These stress-sensing kinases phosphorylate the eukaryotic translation initiation factor and reduce global protein synthesis as a protective mechanism. It wards off stressing the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) from an overproduction of proteins, reduces the consumption of iron and amino acids in times of starvation of these proteins, and blocks viral or bacterial replication by hindering protein synthesis.</p>
        <p>The eukaryotic translation initiation factor also promotes the translation of activating transcription factor 4, which has several functions. Activation of activating transcription factor 4 allows for cellular adaptation to stress via increased production of transporters, such as for amino acids to overcome nutrient limitations. Activating transcription factor 4 also induces CCAT enhancer-binding homologous protein (CHOP). This transcription factor aids the eukaryotic translation initiation factor phosphatase, GADD34 (growth arrest and DNA damage 34), for synthesizing various proteins. This protein synthesis can further induce damage to the ERs in the lungs if the insult continues chronically by overpopulating the ERs. CHOP also induces ER oxidase 1a to promote oxidative protein folding, the production of ROS species, as well as IL-8 induction, a proinflammatory gene all leading to chronic lung damage.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-798.r4">[4]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-798.s4" sec-type="Development">
        <title>Development</title>
        <p>There are 5 phases or periods of lung development: embryonic, pseudoglandular, canalicular, saccular, and alveolar. The development of the lungs begins at week 4 of pregnancy, the embryonic period. This stage spans from weeks 4 through 9 and coincides with the pseudoglandular period, which spans from weeks 5 through 18. At this time there is the formation of the major airways. The canalicular period spans weeks 16 through 27, including epithelial differentiation and air-blood barrier formation. From weeks 26 through 38, the saccular period is where surfactant production begins, depicting viability. This period also allows the expansion of spaces within the lungs. Lastly, the alveolar period concludes lung maturity by forming secondary septations and continuing to produce surfactant. The presence of sufficient surfactant is the indicator of lung maturity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-798.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0; &#x000a0;</p>

        <title>Organ Systems Involved</title>
        <p>The pulmonary system is the organ system solely involved in this inflammatory stress response to external pathogens and toxins.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-798.r6">[6]</xref></p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-798.s6" sec-type="Function">
        <title>Function</title>
        <p>The purpose of the lungs is to inhale oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and exhale carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). Room air (21% oxygen) enters the lungs through negative pressure due to the pulling pressure of the diaphragm, distributes throughout the alveoli, and ventilates the capillaries at the alveolar-capillary membrane, participating in gas exchange for CO<sub>2</sub>. The CO<sub>2</sub> then travels back through the alveoli and upper airways to be exhaled into the environment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-798.r3">[3]</xref> This mechanism allows the body to maintain oxygenation and an acid-base balance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-798.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;While participating in this respiration, pathogens can enter and exit at their own will. The mucociliary escalator and alveolar macrophages are the first to ward off such insults.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-798.s7" sec-type="Mechanism">
        <title>Mechanism</title>
        <p>As discussed, the particles that exist in our environment are endless. Therefore, our lungs have anatomical defense mechanisms to avoid these toxins. The mucociliary escalator begins from the level of primary bronchi to the level of the terminal bronchioles. It consists of cilia and goblet cells that secrete mucus. Larger particles are warded off in these areas, triggering the cough reflex to allow the exit of pathogens that may have entered the bronchi. Further down, extending from the terminal bronchioles to the alveoli, the alveolar macrophages engulf smaller particles (less than 2 micrometers). They break the particles down and digest, recruiting more macrophages or other cells, such as neutrophils, to help ward off the stressors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-798.r7">[7]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-798.s8" sec-type="Related Testing">
        <title>Related Testing</title>
        <p>Pulmonary function tests are&#x000a0;1 of the first steps to help establish a diagnosis of obstructive versus restrictive lung disease in the diagnosis of any chronic lung pathology.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-798.r8">[8]</xref> Chest X-rays also help determine the acute or chronic pathology of the lung, whether it shows a ground-glass appearance, as seen in interstitial lung disease, hyperinflation, such as in COPD, or consolidation, suggesting pneumonia. Further testing, such as CT scans, can also be helpful to get a better look at pathology initially seen on the X-ray or denoted with the clinical symptomology.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-798.s9" sec-type="Pathophysiology">
        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>The stress in the lungs is mainly the result of external pathogens and toxins, such as those from smoke, pollution, bacteria, and viruses, among others. As mentioned above, chronic exposure to such toxins allows for the bypass of the airways' defense. The&#x000a0;particles are both too small to cough out via the mucociliary escalator or to engulf via alveolar macrophages and they rather induce the ISR.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-798.r2">[2]</xref> The kinases involved in the ISR cause damage to the lung as a means of protection and thereby cause chronic diseases, such as COPD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-798.r9">[9]</xref></p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-798.s10" sec-type="Clinical Significance">
        <title>Clinical Significance</title>
        <p>Several chronic lung diseases, such as COPD, cancer, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, severely affect the lungs via the cellular stress response. Smoke inhalation injures the cilia involved in the mucociliary escalator, allowing more particles into the lungs and activating the ISR.</p>
        <p>Research has shown that heightened ER stress, a CHOP-dependent mechanism that leads to oxidative protein folding, has been seen in increased exposure to cigarette smoke in vitro, which thereby likely contributes to the COPD diagnosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-798.r10">[10]</xref> Higher levels of ER stress are also present in chronic smoker&#x02019;s lungs, such as those with COPD. Although CHOP helps contribute to higher ER stress levels, it also holds a protective mechanism, which is mostly unknown but correlates with decreased lung epithelial permeability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-798.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-798.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>Infections of the lungs result from several microorganisms that trigger the ISR. As mentioned above, protein kinase R is triggered by dsRNA in viruses that inhibits protein translation and thereby stops the replication of the virus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-798.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
