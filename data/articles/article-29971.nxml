        <p>Termination of life support is a crucial aspect of end-of-life care, allowing patients to experience a peaceful and dignified death when curative treatments are no longer effective. Physicians should be well-informed about the critical intervention of terminating life support, particularly for patients at the end-of-life stage who have given informed consent and may be eligible for this intervention. The decision to terminate life support is case-specific, often involving terminally ill patients or those nearing the end of life. Providing timely and appropriate end-of-life care has been shown to improve quality of life. When indicated and performed with compassion, withdrawing life-sustaining treatment can facilitate a peaceful death and offer comfort to the bereaved family.</p>
        <p>Examples of life-sustaining treatments include mechanical ventilation, renal dialysis, and artificial nutrition. Comfort measures, such as pain relief, anxiety management, and symptom control, are central to this process. Ethical principles emphasize the distinction between withdrawing life-sustaining treatments and interventions aimed solely at hastening death, underscoring the importance of maintaining patient dignity.&#x000a0;This activity focuses on identifying cases that warrant life support termination and implementing the appropriate protocols. This activity also provides clinicians with deeper insights into the indications and contraindications of life support termination, as well as the preparation and execution processes. In addition, this activity enables healthcare providers to collaborate more effectively within an interprofessional team caring for patients on life support.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>According to the World Health Organization, palliative care is&#x000a0;described as "an approach that improves the quality of life for patients and their families facing problems associated with life-threatening illness. This is achieved through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification, thorough assessment, and effective treatment of pain and other physical, psychosocial, and spiritual issues."&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Physicians in both inpatient and outpatient settings increasingly encounter terminally ill patients, whether managing acute care situations or chronic conditions. In inpatient settings, critical care physicians and hospitalists frequently treat patients nearing the end of life due to acute catastrophic events, rapid decline, or complications from chronic comorbidities. Factors such as advanced age, multiple chronic conditions (eg, cancer, stroke, and heart and renal failure), the increasing number of invasive procedures, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have contributed to situations where death is imminent.</p>
        <p>The United Kingdom General Medical Council defines individuals "approaching the end of life" as those likely to die within the next 12 months, including patients who may pass away within hours or days.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29971.r1">[1]</xref> Most people, including healthy individuals in Western societies, prefer to die at home if given the choice. Given the factors mentioned, physicians must be well-versed in the principles of end-of-life care. While clinicians aim to provide curative treatments, offering patients the option of a dignified "good death" remains crucial when a life-threatening disease cannot be cured.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29971.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29971.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>Most patients describe a "good death" as being pain-free, distress-free, with effective symptom control, and occurring in their preferred location surrounded by loved ones. They often wish to minimize the burden on their families, settle personal affairs, and maintain mental clarity while retaining a sense of value for the life they have lived and achieving closure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29971.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29971.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29971.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;These desires can be summarized by&#x000a0;the term "comfort measures." Implementing comfort measures for patients with terminal illnesses requires understanding disease mechanisms, therapeutic options for symptom relief, social considerations, and the processes involved in arranging appropriate care settings.</p>

        <p>
<bold>Ethical and Practical Considerations When Terminating Life-Sustaining Treatment</bold>
</p>
        <p>Contemporary medical ethics distinguishes between withdrawing life-sustaining treatments, which may indirectly or unintentionally hasten death, and administering interventions specifically intended to expedite death. This nuanced understanding highlights the importance of prioritizing patient comfort and dignity in end-of-life care.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Early and Compassionate Communication</bold>
</p>
        <p>Physicians caring for severely ill patients, whether in a hospital or clinical setting, should consistently consider the need for comfort measures and end-of-life discussions. This proactive approach is especially crucial when treating patients with multiple organ failure, advanced-stage cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, or those requiring mechanical ventilation.</p>
        <p>Open communication about the "goals of care" and end-of-life preferences is essential for patients facing a terminal illness, especially those with a life expectancy of 30 days or less. This delicate conversation requires sensitivity, empathy, and cultural awareness. The goal is to provide honest information with realistic expectations while preserving a sense of hope.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29971.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Engaging with Surrogate Decision-Makers</bold>
</p>
        <p>When direct communication with patients is not feasible due to their clinical condition, discussions should be conducted with their legal surrogate decision-maker. In complex situations, confirming the surrogate's legal status is crucial before proceeding with significant medical discussions. Appointing a single healthcare team member as the primary point of contact fosters trust and ensures continuity of care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29971.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Prioritizing Comfort and Dignity</bold>
</p>
        <p>The primary objective of end-of-life care is to identify and alleviate physical and psychological symptoms while mitigating emotional and spiritual distress.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29971.r9">[9]</xref> Communication strategies, such as the British SAGE &#x00026; THYME model and the Australian PREPARED guidelines, can help clinicians navigate these challenging conversations more comfortably and effectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29971.r10">[10]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29971.r11">[11]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Examples of Life-Sustaining Treatments</bold>
</p>
        <p>Life-sustaining treatments encompass a range of interventions, including:</p>

        <title>Contraindications</title>
        <p>Ideally, discussions about end-of-life care should involve the patient directly. However, it is important to gauge the patient's receptivity to such conversations first. If the patient is experiencing anxiety or stress, it may be necessary to temporarily postpone the discussion, allowing them time for emotional processing and support.</p>
        <p>Patients with cognitive impairment due to an acute or chronic condition may lack the capacity to engage in meaningful discussions about their goals of care. In these cases, it is essential to contact the legal surrogate decision-maker to ensure that the patient's best interests and previously expressed wishes are represented in the decision-making process.</p>

        <title>Preparation</title>
        <p>
<bold>Planning and Implementing the Transition to Comfort Care</bold>
</p>
        <p>Meetings with the patient or their family should be thoughtfully planned, ideally including key personnel such as physicians, nurses, social workers, and palliative care specialists. This collaborative approach ensures comprehensive support and fosters open communication.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Empathetic Communication and Shared Decision-Making</bold>
</p>
        <p>Discussions about potential life support termination should be approached with empathy and compassion, emphasizing the importance of understanding the patient's preferences&#x02014;either directly or through their legal surrogate. The patient's clinical condition, management plan, anticipated course, and prognosis must be communicated in clear, non-technical language. Care levels should be outlined and adjusted according to the patient or surrogate's wishes. To ensure understanding, the surrogate should be encouraged to summarize the main points of the conversation.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Preparing for the Dying Process</bold>
</p>
        <p>Family members should be informed about the physical changes that may occur as the patient transitions to comfort care, including changes in appearance, breathing patterns, and bodily functions. The palliative care team plays a crucial role in providing guidance and support during these sensitive conversations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29971.r12">[12]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Comprehensive End-of-Life Planning</bold>
</p>
        <p>A multidisciplinary plan involving social workers, primary care physicians, and hospice providers should be developed if the patient&#x02019;s life expectancy extends beyond a few days. Children in the family should be informed of the impending death in an age-appropriate, sensitive manner, with guidance from child-care specialists. Religious or spiritual support can be provided by clergy or chaplains to offer comfort and solace to the patient and family. If appropriate, discussions about organ donation and autopsy should also occur. The organ transplant team must lead detailed conversations about organ donation to avoid any conflicts of interest.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Establishing Code Status and Comfort Care Measures</bold>
</p>
        <p>After discussing the overall plan, the patient's code status should be established, clarifying their preferences for resuscitation and intubation. A "no escalation of care" plan may be implemented if the patient's condition deteriorates. The family should be informed of the specific steps in withdrawing life support, including discontinuation of routine diagnostic interventions, initiation of medications for pain and symptom management, and removal of invasive lines and tubes. Typically, one intravenous line and a bladder-draining catheter are maintained to administer pain and symptom control medications, including antiepileptic drugs if required.</p>
        <p>Framing the transition as the "initiation of comfort care" rather than the "withdrawal" or "termination of life support" can be beneficial. This language emphasizes the shift in focus toward maximizing patient comfort and dignity in their final days.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Timeline and Family Accommodations</bold>
</p>
        <p>A tentative timeline for palliative extubation and cessation of life-sustaining treatments should be planned, allowing reasonable accommodations for family members traveling from afar. Institutional visitor policies may need to be adjusted to permit extended family presence while respecting the privacy of all patients and their families. Nonpharmacological comfort measures, such as religious prayers, music, and aromatherapy, may also be offered to provide solace to grieving family members.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Ethical Considerations in Decision-Making</bold>
</p>
        <p>Decisions about initiating, continuing, or withdrawing life-sustaining treatment require careful consideration of the benefits and burdens of therapy in relation to the patient's or surrogate's preferences and goals. The ethical decision to remove life support is complicated but revolves around the principles of beneficence, nonmaleficence, and patient autonomy. Life-sustaining treatments are not obligatory when the burdens outweigh the benefits or when the goals of care shift from extending life to prioritizing comfort and quality of life.&#x000a0;A time-limited trial, with the option to discontinue if the desired outcome is not achieved, may be considered when the risk-benefit ratio of a treatment is uncertain. Ultimately, the decision to withdraw life-sustaining treatment is ethically permissible if it aligns with the patient&#x02019;s goals of care, even if it may result in death.</p>
        <p>Many jurisdictions have laws governing the removal of life support, though most protect the patient's right to refuse medical treatment. The process of removing life support may be governed by specific laws that include requirements for documentation or, in some cases, court rulings. Healthcare providers follow institutional policies and procedures to ensure ethical and legal compliance in end-of-life care decisions.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Emerging Concepts in the Termination of Life Support</bold>
</p>
        <p>Several new concepts, as mentioned below, have emerged in discussions about the termination of life support, reflecting evolving societal perspectives and medical advancements.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Medical Aid in Dying</bold>
</p>
        <p>The&#x000a0;procedure of medical aid in dying (MAID) involves&#x000a0;providing a terminally ill patient with a lethal dose of medication for self-administration, allowing them to end their life with dignity. MAID differs from euthanasia, as it requires the patient to self-administer the medication.&#x000a0;The concept's legality and eligibility criteria vary by jurisdiction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29971.r13">[13]</xref>&#x000a0;While sometimes referred to as "physician-assisted suicide" or "physician-assisted dying," "MAID" is generally considered the preferred term.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment</bold>
</p>
        <p>Physician orders for life-sustaining treatment (POLST) forms are designed to communicate a patient's preferences for life-sustaining treatments in emergencies. These forms are more specific and actionable than advance directives, ensuring that the patient's wishes are honored across different care settings.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29971.r14">[14]</xref>&#x000a0;While POLST forms are useful in emergencies, they cannot substitute for comprehensive, advanced care planning.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Shared Decision-Making</bold>
</p>
        <p>This collaborative approach involves healthcare providers, patients, and families working together to make informed treatment decisions. It incorporates the patient&#x02019;s values and preferences into the decision-making process, aiming to create a care plan that aligns with the patient&#x02019;s goals.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Compassionate Extubation</bold>
</p>
        <p>This process involves withdrawing mechanical ventilation from a patient nearing the end of life or who has chosen to stop life-sustaining treatments. The focus is on ensuring comfort and preserving dignity throughout the dying process.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Advanced Care Planning</bold>
</p>
        <p>This process involves discussions and documentation between patients, families, and healthcare providers regarding preferences for future healthcare, including end-of-life care.&#x000a0;Advanced care planning aims to prepare for potential future health scenarios and ensure that the patient&#x02019;s wishes are known and respected.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Goal-Concordant Care</bold>
</p>
        <p>This&#x000a0;approach ensures that medical interventions align with a patient's personal goals and values.&#x000a0;Goal-concordant care emphasizes patient-centered&#x000a0;therapy and aims to provide treatments that are consistent with the patient&#x02019;s preferences and desired quality of life.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Futile Care Theory</bold>
</p>
        <p>This theory posits that medical treatments failing to achieve their intended goals or provide meaningful benefits to the patient may be considered futile and ethically withdrawn.&#x000a0;This concept helps guide decisions on whether to continue or discontinue specific interventions. However, the definition of "futility" can be subjective and may lead to controversy.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Dignity Therapy</bold>
</p>
        <p>This therapeutic approach assists patients with terminal illnesses in finding meaning and leaving a legacy by creating a document that captures their life stories, values, and messages for loved ones. The intervention aims to enhance patients' sense of dignity and provide closure.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-29971.s7" sec-type="Technique or Treatment">
        <title>Technique or Treatment</title>
        <p>Comfort care begins at the patient&#x02019;s chosen time and place, with their preferred individuals present. The process typically involves administering pain medication, usually an opioid, along with an anxiolytic, often a benzodiazepine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29971.r15">[15]</xref>&#x000a0;This infusion is followed by palliative extubation, accompanied by symptom control medications to manage anxiety, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, air hunger, oral and endotracheal secretions, and fever. Artificial tears and oral hygiene measures are also provided. Depending on the patient&#x02019;s preference, care should balance effective pain control with maintaining wakefulness. Comfort feeding and supplemental oxygen may also be offered.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29971.r16">[16]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Family members are encouraged to spend time with the patient, and efforts are made to minimize nursing interventions. They are also invited to participate in legacy-building activities, such as taking pictures or making handprints with the patient if possible.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29971.r17">[17]</xref>&#x000a0;If the patient survives longer than expected, they may be transitioned to inpatient or home hospice care with appropriate support. A healthcare team member&#x000a0;should confirm the time of death, complete the death certificate, and handle any related documentation. Reaching out to the grieving family to offer condolences is a compassionate practice. Additionally, medical staff should address and alleviate their own moral and emotional stress from these clinical encounters. Informal and formal measures, such as counseling, can help manage this distress, as neglecting it may lead to empathy fatigue and burnout.</p>

        <p>Terminating life support is sometimes clinically necessary for patients at the end of life who have expressed a desire to avoid aggressive interventions in case their clinical condition deteriorates.&#x000a0;Life support termination&#x000a0;prevents futile care that may involve invasive interventions, which can potentially and adversely impact the patient's quality of life without offering significant survival benefits. Withdrawing life-sustaining treatment also provides comfort to the grieving family, allowing them to witness a pain-free and peaceful death of their loved one.</p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>A multidisciplinary approach is essential for humanely and effectively implementing life support termination. Compassion, empathetic communication, and support staff involvement help families address social and financial challenges. Together, these steps ensure the delivery of high-quality care to patients with terminal illnesses. Palliative care has been shown to improve quality of life and, in some cases, even extend life expectancy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29971.r18">[18]</xref>&#x000a0;Terminating life support, with a focus on effective pain and symptom management, allows the patient to die peacefully. This process also supports grieving family members, helping them cope with their distress and bereavement.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Death is the ultimate reality for everyone. While modern medicine can delay death to some extent, it is essential to ensure that the dying process is pain-free for the patient and less stressful for the grieving family when death is inevitable. A physician's duty extends beyond immediate patient care to include support for the family both before and after bereavement. While everyone aspires to a good life, providing access to a "good death" is equally important when possible.</p>
