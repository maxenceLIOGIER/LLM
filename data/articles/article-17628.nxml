With this method, the examiner can&#x000a0;visualize the internal portions of the anal sphincter and the distal rectum.

        <p>Hemorrhoids are clusters of vascular, connective, and smooth muscle tissue which exist in the left lateral, right anterior, and right posterior portion of the anal canal. While internal hemorrhoids drain into the middle and superior rectal veins, patients with portal hypertension nonetheless do not have an increased incidence of varies. Since&#x000a0;internal hemorrhoids lie above the dentate line, they have visceral innervation and are not painful, but they may become symptomatic due to bleeding and/or prolapse from the rectal canal. Severely prolapsed internal hemorrhoids may be painful if&#x000a0;strangulated, and secondarily ischemic Conversely, external hemorrhoids emerge inferior to the dentate line and have somatic innervation from the perianal skin and can cause significant discomfort. Anoscopy can be useful to characterize the presence of enlarged internal hemorrhoids, but external hemorrhoids may preclude anoscopy due to discomfort.</p>

        <p>This procedure can be useful in individuals experiencing rectal/anal discomfort to evaluate for common lower gastrointestinal pathology which can cause pain such as anal fissures, sexually transmitted infection, anal condylomata, or bleeding such as internal hemorrhoids, rectal ulceration/inflammation, rectal varices or trauma. Anoscopy can be useful in evaluating for anal cancer, particularly in high-risk groups such as in&#x000a0;men who have sex with men and have co-existing HIV infection. This translates to a lifetime risk of 7% to 8% in a male infected in his 20s. There are no current routine screening guidelines at this time.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17628.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17628.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17628.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17628.r8">[8]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Anoscopes come in the slotted and non-slotted variety, both with an obturator or occlusion device which is left in place during insertion. Both devices are then gradually removed with the obturator removed, enabling visualization. The non-slotted variety has the benefit of allowing 360-degree visualization of the entire anal passage versus the slotted version which provides a view of only a small portion of the distal rectum and anal opening at a time. As a consequence, the slotted version may require several passes to provide complete visualization if the patient is unable to tolerate the rotation of the device. Most commercially available anoscopes do not include a built-in light source, leaving providers to use either a head-mounted light source or to enlist an assistant in directing the light source to allow adequate&#x000a0;visualization. High-resolution anoscopy is a specialized&#x000a0;procedure involving camera-assisted magnification and is typically considered to be out&#x000a0;of the scope of practice of&#x000a0;practitioners who have not received specialized training in its use.</p>

        <p>Topical anesthesia is&#x000a0;administered, with 2% lidocaine jelly inserted into the anal canal at least 10 minutes before insertion of the anoscope. If necessary, intravenous (IV) medications such as opiates (eg, morphine sulfate) or benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam, diazepam, midazolam) may be administered for analgesia and light sedation. &#x000a0;In some situations, it may be reasonable to consider IV sedation&#x000a0;with agents such as fentanyl, midazolam, propofol, ketamine, or etomidate.&#x000a0;</p>

            <p>The patient can be placed in multiple positions to facilitate the procedure.

The patient can also be placed in the knee-shoulder position or the prone position.</p>

        <title>Technique or Treatment</title>
        <p>Typically, the examiner will perform a digital rectal exam first to ensure that no mass or tissue is obstructing the anal canal which could be injured during the insertion of the device. There is insufficient evidence to comment on the efficacy of topical pre-procedure lidocaine application to provide analgesia during anoscopy, but in the absence of known lidocaine allergy, many practitioners consider this a reasonable measure to adopt. The water-soluble lubricant is applied to the anoscope itself pre-insertion to facilitate insertion. This may be accomplished using the topical anesthetic as a de-facto lubricant, thereby providing an opportunity for the lidocaine to be distributed along the path of the anoscope before its introduction. Typically, the device is introduced with the obturator in place which is then removed, allowing the examiner to visualize the anal canal and distal rectum as the anoscope is slowly withdrawn. In the case of slotted anoscopes, which only allow visualization of a portion of the mucosa at the time, the obturator should be reinserted before reinserting or rotating the device due to the discomfort associated with placing traction of the segment of tissue which bulges into the slotted segment.</p>

        <title>Clinical Significance</title>
        <p>While anoscopy appears to be the superior procedure for identifying distal anorectal pathologies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17628.r10">[10]</xref> such as internal hemorrhoids, proctitis, or ulcerations (which cannot be reliably identified or differentiated from one another on a digital rectal exam) which may lead patients to present with complaints of bleeding or discomfort, there are significant limitations to this procedure. While anoscopy is highly sensitive for identifying pathology such as internal hemorrhoids, findings seen on anoscopy do not allow practitioners to rule out a proximal source of GI bleeding, which is identified&#x000a0;subsequently on endoscopy up to 50% of the time. Therefore, the finding of a potential source of GI bleeding such as internal hemorrhoids in isolation does not allow the examiner to exclude an additional source of bleeding.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, anoscopy is a useful adjunct for screening for anorectal pathology which is inexpensive and can be accomplished quickly and without preparation. However, the procedure must not be unduly relied upon in the evaluation of a patient with rectal bleeding, since the presence of rectal pathology does not rule out a proximal source of bleeding.&#x000a0;</p>

        <p>Healthcare workers including nurse practitioners and primary care providers should be familiar with anoscopy. This bedside procedure is inexpensive, can be performed quickly without bowel preparation&#x000a0;or the&#x000a0;need for sedation. With this method, the examiner can&#x000a0;visualize the internal portions of the anal sphincter and the distal rectum.

Up to 50% of rectal bleeding can be falsely attributed to hemorrhoids without internal examination to confirm this diagnosis. However, it is also important to know the limitations of anoscopy and whenever there is a doubt about the diagnosis, the patient should be referred to the gastroenterologist or general surgeon for further workup.&#x000a0;</p>
