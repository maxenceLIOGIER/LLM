        <p>Terrorism is the intentional use of indiscriminate violence to create fear and terror as a means to achieve an ideological, financial, religious, or political aim. It is often used against non-combatant targets. Terror tactics may include biologic, chemical, nuclear, or explosive events. Terrorism is generally considered to be the use of force or violence outside the law to create fear among citizens with the intent to coerce some sort of action. Health professionals should be aware bioterrorism is a potential vehicle for terrorists to influence populations in the hopes of achieving their agenda. All health professionals need to be prepared for this potentially catastrophic event. This activity reviews the types, evaluation, and treatment of biologic, chemical, and radiation terrorism and discusses the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating catastrophic events associated with terrorism.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Terrorism is the intentional use of indiscriminate violence to create fear and terror as a means to achieve an ideological, financial, religious, or political aim. It is often used against non-combatant targets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40691.r1">[1]</xref>. Terror tactics may include biologic, chemical, nuclear, or explosive events.</p>
        <p>
<bold> Biologic</bold>
</p>
        <p>Bioterrorism is the intentional release of biological agents to cause illness or death in humans, animals, or plants. These agents may be bacteria, fungi, toxins, or viruses. They may be naturally occurring or human-modified.</p>
        <p>The agents are typically found in nature, but they may be altered in a laboratory to increase their resistance to antibiotics, and ability to spread in the environment. Biological and chemical agents may be spread through the air, food, or water. Terrorists use biological agents because they are often difficult to detect and illness onset may be delayed for hours to days increasing dispersal.&#x000a0;The challenge with bioweapons is that they may affect both enemy and friendly forces, and do not discriminate between combatants and civilians.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40691.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>In the last 100 years, the United States and the international community have experienced multiple acts of bioterrorism which have targeted civilians.</p>

        <p>
<bold>Chemical</bold>
</p>
        <p>During World War I there was widespread use of chemical weapons resulting in many deaths, both military and civilian. The atrocities experienced on all sides of this conflict led to the 1925 Geneva Protocol, prohibiting the use of chemical and biological weapons in war. While most modern states are either signatories to, or voluntarily abide by, this treaty and subsequent United Nations resolutions, there have been a few instances of chemical weapos use more recently. Iraqi forces utilized organophosphate neurotoxins against several targets in 1987-1988 in the war with the Islamic Republic of Iran on both military and civilan targets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40691.r3">[3]</xref>. In 2017, the Syrian government was accused of using nerve agents and chlorine munitions against the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the ongoing civil war<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40691.r4">[4]</xref>.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Nuclear</bold>
</p>
        <p>To date, other than the dropping of nuclear bombs by the United States to end World War II, there have been no acts of nuclear attack or nuclear terrorism. Nuclear terrorism is an act of terrorism in which a terrorist organization detonates a nuclear device. The possibility of terrorist organizations using nuclear is considered plausible as terrorists could acquire a nuclear weapon. However, despite thefts of small amounts of fissile material, there is no credible evidence any terrorist group has succeeded in obtaining the necessary multi-kilogram critical mass amounts of weapons-grade plutonium required to make a nuclear weapon.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Explosive</bold>
</p>
        <p>Traditional small-arms munitioins and improvised explosive devices are among the most common agents used in terrorist actions. Explosive devices and arms can be stolen or purchased, as was seen in the 2015 attacks on the Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris. More commonly they are manufactured as improvised explosive devices and hidden, such as the 1988 Pan Am flight from Lockerbie, Scotland, the 2004 bombings of the Madrid subway, or the 2013 bombings of the Boston marathon race in the United States<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40691.r5">[5]</xref>.</p>

<bold>Terrorism Definitions</bold>
</p>
        <p>What is terrorism? What is a mass casualty incident?</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>The United Nations definition of terrorism describes it as &#x0201c;an anxiety-inspiring method of repeated violent action, employed by (semi-) clandestine individual, group, or state actors, for idiosyncratic, criminal, or political reasons, whereby&#x02014;in contrast to assassination&#x02014;the direct targets of violence are not the main targets.&#x0201d;</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>The Department of Defense defines terrorism as &#x0201c;the unlawful use of violence or threat of violence, often motivated by religious, political, or other ideological beliefs, to instill fear and coerce governments or societies in pursuit of goals that are usually political.&#x0201d;&#x000a0;</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency defines terrorism as &#x0201c;the use of force or violence against persons or property in violation of the criminal laws of the United States for purposes of intimidation, coercion, or ransom. Terrorists often use threats to create fear among the public, to try to convince citizens that their government is powerless to prevent terrorism, and to get immediate publicity for their cause&#x0201d;.&#x000a0;</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>The US Code of Federal Regulations defines terrorism as &#x0201c;the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.&#x0201d;</p>

        <p>Terrorism is generally considered to be the use of force or violence outside the law to create fear among citizens with the intent to coerce some sort of action.

        <title>Function</title>
        <p>The goal or function of a terror event is to create mass hysteria. Health professionals must learn to mitigate this effect by being able to recognize an attack and treat and calm victims.</p>
        <p>Terrorist acts can be either covert or overt. In a covert attack, the terrorists are attempting to take advantage of the element of surprise. Health professionals must be diligent in evaluating the possibility of a covert attack when multiple patients arrive with similar signs and symptoms. In this setting, the healthcare system may be quickly overloaded unless the institution and staff have prepared and have systems in place to handle a large influx of patient volume. The sooner an event is recognized as an attack, the sooner additional resources can be activated to assist providers. Unless the system prepares in advance, the number of victims triaged may quickly overwhelm the system and result in the terrorist&#x02019;s goal of creating mass panic.</p>
        <p>In an overt attack, terrorists rely heavily on mass hysteria and panic as an impact multiplier. They may announce responsibility immediately for a large-scale event. The number of victims quickly overwhelms even prepared systems that have a well-defined emergency response plan. In either a covert or overt terrorist attack, the system may be flooded with victims.</p>

<bold>Biological Weapons</bold>
</p>
        <p>Biological warfare agents are bacteria and viruses that infect humans, animals, and crops resulting in an incapacitating or fatal disease or crop destruction. Symptoms may not appear for days to weeks. Of greatest concern is the bacteria or virus has been weaponized (changed to facilitate spread of infection or severity of disease), and the changes will affect a broader segment of humans, animals, or crops than the normal pathogen.</p>
        <p>In a biological warfare terror event, healthcare providers must deal with uncommon pathogens that rarely affect humans. Healthcare facilities will be inundated with victims. The arrival of one or more victims with an odd presentation may be the initial indication that an act of terrorism has occurred.</p>
        <p>Biologic agents may be dispersed by several techniques including contaminated water and aerosol sprays. They can also infect individuals and place them on airplanes, buses, or large events that will disperse the virus quickly.</p>
        <p>
<italic toggle="yes">
<bold>Surveillance</bold>
</italic>
</p>
        <p>All healthcare providers should have the knowledge to identify and initiate a local response to an act of bioterrorism. The starting point is the status quo or their normal patient population. If there is a significant deviation from the norm, this should alert the astute clinician to the possibility of an outbreak. It must then be determined if this outbreak was intentional (such as a terror attack), unintentional (such as a contamination or leak from research facility), or natural.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40691.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>Providers must be aware of clinical features including:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>A cluster of persons with similar symptoms from a common geographical area</p>

          <list-item>

          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>These factors reflect changes from the status quo in the community. An astute clinician with a sense of the community&#x02019;s general normal health can make a significant difference in how soon a response to the threat begins. If the person admits to no foreign travel in endemic areas of rare viruses, and the suspicion is high, contacting the local health department or CDC is in order.</p>

Confirmations may require a sample of cerebral spinal fluid or brain tissue although CT scans and MRI scans are used to detect encephalitis.</p>

<bold>NUCLEAR WEAPONS</bold>
</p>
        <p>Nuclear weapons are weapons of mass destruction. Nuclear warfare can produce destruction in a much shorter time and have a long-lasting radiological result. A major nuclear exchange would have long-term effects, primarily from the fallout released that could last for centuries. If a nuclear war occurs, it is expected many will die acutely followed by deaths from starvation and the international catastrophes to the health and welfare of citizens that would ensue. So far, 2 nuclear weapons have been used, both by the United States near the end of World War II. While it ended the war sooner, saving countless lives, these 2 bombings resulted in the immediate deaths of approximately 120,000 people.</p>
        <p>There are two types of nuclear weapons: fission and fusion.</p>
        <p>
<italic toggle="yes">Fission</italic>
</p>
        <p>All existing nuclear weapons derive some of their explosive energy from a nuclear fission reaction. Weapons whose explosive output is exclusively from fission reactions are referred to as atomic bombs or atom bombs.</p>
        <p>
<italic toggle="yes">Fusion</italic>
</p>
        <p>Fusion weapons produce a large proportion of energy in nuclear fusion reactions. Such fusion weapons are referred to as thermonuclear weapons or hydrogen bombs. All such weapons derive a significant portion of their energy from fission reactions which are used to "trigger" fusion reactions. The primary pathologic effect of ionizing radiation causes damage to DNA. The common pathway of injury is radiation deposits energy into the electron orbitals of atoms in the biologic medium.</p>

        <p>Early onset of prodromal symptoms indicates a poor prognosis.</p>
        <p>Acute radiation syndrome has three subsyndromes: cerebrovascular, gastrointestinal, and hematopoietic.</p>
        <p>
<italic toggle="yes">Cerebrovascular</italic>
</p>
        <p>Greater than 30 Gy causes cerebrovascular syndrome which is uniformly fatal. Doses greater than 100 Gy results in death in a few hours. Vascular damage results in significant cerebral edema, resulting in cardiovascular collapse. The patient will develop nausea, vomiting, ataxia, hypotension, tachycardia, and convulsions followed by death.</p>
        <p>
<italic toggle="yes">Gastrointestinal</italic>
</p>
        <p>Exposures of 5 to 12 Gy result in gastrointestinal syndrome. Irradiation causes cell death of the intestinal mucosal stem cells in the crypts. After the loss of mucosal cells, the stem cells are unable to produce new cells, resulting in denudation of the gastrointestinal tract. As the normal cells are destroyed, bacterial growth proliferates, and nausea, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, dehydration, abdominal cramps, and weight loss develops. Often the prodrome is rapid, which is followed by a latent period. Treatment includes fluids, electrolytes, and antibiotics. Unfortunately, death usually occurs in 3 to 10 days.</p>
        <p>
<italic toggle="yes">Hematopoietic</italic>
</p>
        <p>Exposures of 2 to 5 Gy causes the hematopoietic syndrome. Lymphocytes die from radiation caused apoptosis, and precursor cells in the bone marrow are destroyed which prevents the production of leukocytes and platelets. Gradually circulating cells die off with no replacements; the syndrome progresses to infections and possible hemorrhage. Early supportive care, treatment and prevention of infections, and cytokine therapy may decrease morbidity and mortality. However, death commonly still occurs from multi-system organ failure.</p>

        <p>Triage: Contaminated individuals are identified by proximity to the known release, signs, and symptoms. If the patient requires life-saving treatment, this supersedes decontamination. Staff must wear PPE and stabilize the victim before entry into decontamination.</p>

        <p>The ever-present potential of a terrorist bombing concerns as it may well lead to countless casualties; however, a biologic, chemical, or nuclear attack may rise to the level of an international catastrophe. Healthcare professional must prepare as individuals and as a team to care for the victims. It is important for each of us to acquire the information and skills needed to respond and to take steps to limit to the morbidity and mortality associated with a such an attack.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, many political organizations are using terrorism to try to achieve their goals. It is difficult to explain terrorism, we must live with it, and as health professionals prepare ourselves to deal with it.</p>

        <p>Terrorism is the intentional use of indiscriminate violence to create fear and terror. Unfortunately, it is now commonly used as a means to achieve an ideological, financial, religious, or political aim. Terror tactics may include biologic, chemical, nuclear, or explosive events. Health professionals should be aware bioterrorism is a perfect vehicle for terrorists to strike fear into the hearts and minds of citizens. To provide the best outcomes, all health professionals need to be prepared for this potentially catastrophic event and be aware of the signs, symptoms, and treatment options available. [Level 5]</p>
