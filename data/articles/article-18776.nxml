        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Calcium channels play an essential critical role in a variety of physiological functions in cells. They include all pore-forming membrane proteins that are calcium-permeable and used for the transport of these ions across cell membranes. As an ion, calcium is unique in biological systems; this is because calcium not only functions to generate membrane potentials and electrical signals but also functions as a central cell signaling molecule. Therefore, calcium channels play an even more involved role in the cell by allowing for the generation of a multitude of cellular responses. Calcium channels come in many forms and are incredibly diverse in both structure and function.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Furthermore, there are a variety of methods by which they may be categorized. To provide an overview of calcium channels, it is necessary to describe the different types of calcium channels, their structures, functions in cellular responses, pharmacological properties, and associated pathologies. This article will attempt to summarize this diverse class of proteins to elucidate their nature at the molecular, cellular, tissue, and organismal levels.</p>

        <title>Fundamentals</title>
        <p>Ion channels are pore-forming integral membrane proteins that are composed of various combinations of subunits.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r2">[2]</xref> Embedded in cell membranes, these subunits associate with one another, and together they form a channel in the membrane that permits specific ions to pass through. Ion channels generally consist of three main components, a selectivity filter that provides ion specificity, a gate to control ion flow, and an ion-permeable pore, which provides a pathway for ions through cell membranes. As their name suggests, calcium channels are permeable to calcium ions and play a critical role in the functioning of all eukaryotic cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Their primary function in the cell is to regulate the concentrations of calcium inside the cell and throughout different cellular compartments. The regulation of calcium ion concentrations is critical for proper cellular functioning since calcium plays a role in almost all cellular processes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;It achieves this through a variety of means different means, some of which include acting as a second messenger and contributing to an electrochemical gradient.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>The concentration of calcium inside the cell can vary widely depending on location.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;At rest, calcium channels contribute to maintaining an extremely low concentration of cytoplasmic calcium, at 10(-7)M <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r5">[5]</xref>, which is about 1000 times lower than extracellular calcium concentrations. Dysfunctional regulation of calcium concentrations can result in serious deleterious effects on cells, including apoptosis and cell death.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Because calcium regulates almost every aspect of cell function, the calcium concentration and its signaling processes in the cell require tight regulation. Calcium channels must balance the influx of calcium into the cell and the efflux of calcium out of the cell.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r6">[6]</xref> They can be stimulated by a variety of stimuli including, but not limited to, membrane depolarization, signaling molecules (both extracellular and intracellular), and physical forces acting on the membrane itself like stretch or temperature.</p>
        <p>A plasma membrane is an important place for calcium channels to carry out their function by regulating the entry and exit of calcium from the cell. One of the most important types of calcium channels found on plasma membranes is voltage-gated calcium channels, which rapidly transport calcium into the cytoplasm. These channels respond to a change in voltage across the cell membrane, which is driven by an electrochemical gradient. They are especially critical for the initiation of cellular processes, including muscle contraction and gene transcription.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>Other calcium channels exist on the plasma membrane to transport calcium out of the cell to provide a very low cytosolic concentration. These channels include various calcium channel pumps and exchangers. Among these are the plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA) pump and the sodium/calcium ion exchanger (NCX), which expend large amounts of energy to function.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r4">[4]</xref> These channels are critical to the cell because a low cytosolic calcium concentration is vital for it to be used as a second messenger.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r5">[5]</xref> Also, these pumps and exchangers are necessary to terminate calcium-dependent cellular responses. Other calcium channels also exist on the plasma membrane. Specialized cell types, for example, contain unique varieties of calcium channels on their plasma membranes. In neurons, calcium channels open in response to the binding of neurotransmitters to cell surface receptors that are permeable to calcium, such as NMDA and AMPA receptors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r3">[3]</xref> Another example is in sensory cells, whose plasma membrane calcium channels open in response to mechanical stimuli like stretch and temperature such as Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Ultimately, the plasma membrane serves as an essential place for calcium channels and provides both a source of calcium and a place to excrete it.</p>
        <p>Calcium is so essential for intracellular processes that the cell stores it in high concentrations, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in muscle cells). The ER/SR serves as the main storage site for calcium inside the cell.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;Like the plasma membrane, calcium channels are embedded in the membranes of the ER/SR to regulate the transfer of calcium between the cytoplasm and the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;Storage in the ER/SR also provides an additional place to transport calcium to keep cytoplasmic calcium concentrations low. A particularly important calcium channel is the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) pump, which transports calcium from the cytoplasm to the sarcoplasmic reticulum and complements the actions of PMCA and NCX to decrease cytosolic calcium concentrations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>Other channels exist to transport calcium in the opposite direction from the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic plasmic reticulum to the cytoplasm, such as the inositol&#x000a0;triphosphate (IP3) receptor and ryanodine receptor (RyR).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;By releasing calcium into the cytoplasm, these channels rapidly provide the calcium necessary for the cell to perform various calcium-dependent intracellular processes. By mediating actions like calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) and the activation of intracellular calcium signaling pathways through the macromolecular coupling of receptors, these calcium channels are critical in mediating calcium "on" responses. The transport of calcium across the ER/SR contributes to overall calcium homeostasis and is responsible for regulating various cellular processes, including muscle contraction and cell differentiation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>Once calcium has been released into the cytoplasm, the calcium stored inside the storage organelles of the ER/SR eventually becomes depleted. For the cell to continue performing calcium-dependent responses, these stores need to be rapidly replenished. Special calcium channels exist for this purpose called store-operated calcium channels, which mediate a process called store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). The way these channels function involve a complex series of events that have only recently come to light. They form when concentrations of calcium in the lumen of the ER are low, sensed by a calcium-sensing protein called the stomal interacting molecule (STIM). When calcium becomes low, the STIM protein oligomerizes and moves to the ER membrane, where it interacts with another protein called Orai1, referred to as a calcium-release activated channel (CRAC). The interaction between these two proteins creates a passageway for calcium between the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane. Through the bypassing of these two different membrane systems, a direct passageway for calcium from the cell exterior to the primary storage organelles is made possible. Because the concentration of calcium is generally one thousand or more times greater outside of the cell than inside, it provides a powerful mechanism by which intracellular calcium levels are rapidly replenished.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <p>&#x000a0;All calcium channels play an essential role in calcium homeostasis and signaling in the cell. It is not possible to describe every type of calcium channel in this article. However, the essential calcium channels that contribute to the regulation of calcium concentration in the cell will be discussed. Ultimately, calcium channels are involved in a large number of different processes. They exhibit significant diversity in both structure, function, and pharmacology. The abnormal functioning of calcium channels is associated with a large number of pathological conditions. As a result, a greater understanding of calcium channels is necessary.</p>

        <p>Calcium channels perform functions that act not only on a molecular scale through the transportation of calcium ions, but on a cellular level by participating in whole-cell processes that affect an entire organism. As a result, the regulation of calcium is exceptionally precise. As stated previously, the concentration of calcium during resting conditions is kept extremely low by the actions of various calcium pumps, channels, and exchangers. The purpose of this is so that calcium may act as an intracellular signal, which may be initiated or modified by calcium channels on the plasma membrane or in membranes of intracellular organelles. These rapid calcium fluxes exhibit characteristics that provide the cell with additional information than signal stimulus intensity. These signals also give information that shows both spatial and temporal properties.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Furthermore, calcium signals may be self-regulatory, whereby calcium channels are regulated by calcium itself. As a result, not only does calcium act as a signal itself, but it can modify its own signal through its actions on calcium channel function. Because of the unique features of calcium channels, they can participate in functions much more complicated than merely the transportation of ions. Each cell type can carry out specific physiological functions by the presence of unique combinations of calcium channels on their cell membranes. Together, they provide information concerning the precise duration, frequency, timing, and amplitude of a calcium signal to control a particular calcium-dependent signaling process.</p>
        <p>All calcium channels generate brief pulses or transients of calcium by their opening.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;By their nature, these calcium transients can generate a variety of different kinds of signals via the temporal characteristics of calcium release existing on different possible time scales. At the smallest end of the time scale, for example, calcium transients generated by fast calcium channels can mediate processes such as exocytosis of neurotransmitters and hormones on the order of milliseconds by creating rapid calcium fluxes. Effector systems are present in the cell to respond to these brief calcium transients to perform processes that must occur rapidly. Moving up the time scale, repeated activation of transient-generating calcium channels may generate slightly longer, more robust calcium signals if occurring over an extended duration in the form of calcium "waves."</p>
        <p>Calcium waves spread throughout the cytoplasm and occur on the order of seconds to minutes. At this time scale, ryanodine receptors, for example, mediate a self-regenerative calcium amplifying process known as calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) through positive feedback, which is essential for muscle contraction. Calcium channel-generated calcium waves are also involved in modifying the actions of various calcium-dependent proteins such as CaMKII, MAP-kinases, and CREB, which can modify intracellular processes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Further up the time scale, the repeated generation of calcium waves over an extended period can result in the transformation of these calcium waves into calcium "oscillations." Calcium oscillations occur in the order of minutes to hours and carry implications in a variety of complex cellular processes such as cellular proliferation, axonal growth, and cell migration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r10">[10]</xref> In total, calcium channels influence cellular processes through the generation of temporal signals, which allow them to participate in the activation, modification, and regulation of complex cellular processes.</p>
        <p>Calcium channels also generate signals that are spatial in nature that dependent on highly localized signaling structures and processes. For example, the release of calcium by a single calcium channel generates a localized increase in calcium just adjacent to the channel. This localized increase in calcium may create elementary calcium signals referred to as calcium "puffs" or "sparks," depending on the channel and can initiate highly localized responses; this is made possible by the ability of some calcium channels such as IP3 and ryanodine receptors to form organized and highly localized macromolecular complexes with other proteins such as receptors (i.e., G-protein coupled receptors or receptor tyrosine kinases) or calcium-binding/calcium-dependent proteins.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>These organized macromolecular signaling processes are the bases of calcium signaling "units," which can function autonomously. These calcium signaling units can then be summed, multiplied, or otherwise calculated together to create even more complex cellular responses. Examples of processes that involve these organized macromolecular complexes include the synaptic integration of information by single neurons. Input-specific calcium-dependent synaptic modifications occur during the processes of learning and memory on individual dendritic spines, and they depend on localized processes that occur adjacent to single calcium channels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r11">[11]</xref></p>
        <p>Calcium channels do not simply open and close to allow the passage of calcium. Calcium channels can open and close in intricate patterns that contain specific temporal and spatial characteristics to produce complex cellular responses. The cell has utilized calcium channels not only to provide calcium for calcium-dependent cellular processes but to encode information that accompanies the release of calcium to produce specific intracellular signals. Through this, calcium channels mediate processes that affect the entire cell addition to the affecting processes at the molecular level.</p>
        <p>An example of a whole-cell process controlled almost entirely by the actions of calcium channels is in the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction in cardiac myocytes. Calcium channels are the structural components of cardiac cells that provide a mechanism to modulate the force of contraction. One of the ways that this occurs is through beta-adrenergic receptor (b-AR) stimulation to cause a positive inotropic response that is regulated by protein kinase A (PKA). The initiation of a cardiac muscle contraction is mediated by the entry of calcium through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels on the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.</p>
        <p>During each action potential, cAMP is produced by the Ga(S) subunit of the B-adrenergic receptor upon activation by norepinephrine. PKA becomes activated by cAMP resulting in widespread changes in calcium channel function. As a kinase, it displays phosphorylative activity to modify the actions of calcium channels, specifically L-type VGCCs, SERCA, and RyRs. When L-type VGCCs are phosphorylated, each action potential can produce a larger flux of calcium resulting in potentiation of channel currents. Secondly, PKA phosphorylates phospholamban, which disinhibits the actions of the SERCA pump, which results in more calcium available in the sarcoplasmic reticulum for muscle contraction. Thirdly, phosphorylation of ryanodine receptors by PKA increases their ability to generate the calcium sparks necessary for calcium-induced calcium release (CICR), which is required to initiate muscle contraction. Ultimately, this process is an example where calcium channel activity can be modified to produce different responses by the sympathetic nervous system through kinase-mediated phosphorylation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r12">[12]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r13">[13]</xref></p>

        <p>VGCCs are located on the plasma membrane and open in response to a change in voltage across the plasma membrane. Currently, there are ten known subtypes of voltage-gated calcium channels, each with a different molecular structure and variations in subunit composition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r19">[19]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r20">[20]</xref>&#x000a0;All voltage-gated calcium channels contain one of ten different a1 subunits. The a1 subunit that a particular VGCC channel contains determines to which subtype the channel belongs. In addition to the a1 subunit, there are also four auxiliary subunits: A beta (B), a2, delta, and a gamma subunit, with the a2 and delta subunits connected by a disulfide bond.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r21">[21]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r19">[19]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r22">[22]</xref> The auxiliary subunits are not present in every subtype of voltage-gated calcium channels.

For example, the Cav2.2 N-type VGCC contains the Cav2.2 a1 subunit.

The transmembrane segments (labeled S1-S6) are present in each group. In-between the transmembrane segments S5 and S6 for each domain is a membrane-associated peptide loop continuous with these two segments extruding from the extracellular side of the membrane. Another peptide loop extrudes into the cytosolic side of the membrane connecting S6 of the previous domain to S1 of the next domain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r24">[24]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r12">[12]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r19">[19]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r25">[25]</xref>&#x000a0;The pore itself consists of the S5 and S6 transmembrane segments along with the P-loop.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r19">[19]</xref>&#x000a0;The transmembrane-spanning domains S1-S4 are linked to pore and form the voltage sensor.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r22">[22]</xref>&#x000a0;Finally, the amino and carboxyl terminals provide a regulatory function of channel function through interaction with regulatory proteins.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r24">[24]</xref></p>

        <p>Voltage-gated calcium channels play a crucial role in various cellular processes. In particular, they act as key signal transducers by influencing the electrical excitability of multiple cell types, such as neurons and endocrine cells. They convert electrical signals in the form of action potentials or depolarization into the form of a calcium transient inside the cell by generating rapid calcium fluxes into the cell. These rapid fluxes of calcium are important for mediating fast cellular processes such as muscle contraction, initiation of neurotransmission, and secretion in muscle cells, neurons, and endocrine cells, respectively. In other cell types, the influx of calcium into the cytosol via VGCCs regulates various biochemical processes, such as enzyme activity and gene expression.</p>
        <p>Different subtypes of&#x000a0; VGCCs have different electrophysical properties in terms of current and voltages of activation. As such, these channels mediate the activation of various signal transduction pathways and are involved in diverse cellular processes. For example, in cardiac and smooth muscle cells, large influxes of calcium into the cytoplasm by voltage-gated calcium provide the calcium required to initiate the process of calcium-induced calcium-release (CICR) in ryanodine receptors of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which is essential for initiating muscle contraction.

        <p>Store-operated calcium channels are located on the membrane of the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum. They play an essential role in maintaining a constant store of calcium when required by the cell. Calcium continually leaks out of the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol during normal cellular processes. To avoid depletion of the cell's calcium stores, the cell utilizes store-operated calcium channels. Although the SERCA pump provides the initial storage of calcium, upon generation of cellular response and the utilization of second messengers, of which calcium is an important messenger, calcium gets used by the cell for such processes, and eventually, the calcium stores become depleted. As such, store-operated channels function to avoid the complete emptying of calcium. Essentially, store-operated calcium channels act as mediators of communication for the cell between the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane and provide vital information regarding the status of calcium homeostasis at any given time.</p>

        <p>SERCA and PMCA belong to a group of ion pumps called P-type ATPases. P-type ATPases exist in two conformational states: E1 and E2. In the E1 conformation, the pump exhibits a high affinity for calcium on the cytoplasmic side of the cell. In the E2 conformational state, the transporter&#x02019;s affinity for calcium rapidly decreases and subsequently leads to the release of calcium to the other side of the membrane.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r42">[42]</xref> Calcium ATPase transporters use the energy directly from ATP to pump calcium against its concentration gradient.

        <p>When calcium concentrations are low in the cytosol, the PMCA pump is in the resting position, elicited by the blocking of the phosphorylation site by the C-terminal auto-inhibitory domain. A calcium-sensing protein called cAM binds to calcium when concentrations of cytosolic calcium increase. This causes a conformational change driven by the interaction of Ca-cAM and the autoinhibitory site, which dissociates from the active site. Calcium is transported to the extracellular environment when it ATP-phosphorylates a conserved aspartate residue.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>The voltage sensor for the voltage-gated calcium channels is located at the S4 segments of each a1 homologous domain.

        <p>The oscillations generated by both IP3 and ryanodine receptors enhance the activity of the sodium/calcium exchanger by releasing pulses of calcium, which depolarizes pacemaker cells by creating an inward calcium current. The SERCA pump refills calcium stores in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which is relied upon for the periodic release of calcium from the SR by IP3 and RyR receptors. Ryanodine receptors are sensitized to release periodic calcium sparks upon the slow accumulation of calcium in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum by the SERCA pump. Toward the end of the pacemaker cell action potential, these calcium sparks begin to develop as a result of IP3 receptor calcium signaling. Immediately preceding and contributing to the pacemaker cell depolarization, the action potential is triggered when calcium is suddenly released by ryanodine receptors. The frequency and amplitude of these ryanodine-receptor mediated calcium sparks driving the pacemaker potential are increased by IP3 channel calcium release, which in turn are activated by beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r29">[29]</xref></p>
        <p>IP3 channels mediate the oscillatory calcium signals that drive smooth muscle contraction and are essential for the maintenance of smooth muscle tone. These IP3 channels become activated by various neurotransmitters, including serotonin and norepinephrine. Signals in the form of oscillatory frequency vary according to neurotransmitter concentration. Vascular tone is driven by oscillations generated from the release of calcium stores, which in turn is driven by the presence of these neurotransmitters, whose concentration determines the extent of vascular smooth muscle contraction.</p>
        <p>Ryanodine receptors are critical for both skeletal and cardiac muscle contraction. In these cells, it is involved in excitation-contraction coupling.

        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>Calcium channels appear to be involved in the pathophysiology of chronic pain. Synaptic nerve terminals located in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord receive action potentials propagating through primary afferent fibers, which occur upon activation of peripheral nociceptors in different organs and the skin. Pain is perceived when neurons activate in higher brain areas upon receiving an excitatory synaptic transmission from these dorsal horn synaptic terminals. The neuronal excitability of the afferent fibers is known to be regulated by Cav3.2 T-type VGCCs. Furthermore, neurotransmission in dorsal horn synapses is controlled by both Cav2.2 and Cav3.2 channels. In chronic pain conditions, these calcium channel subtypes have been shown to be upregulated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r21">[21]</xref></p>
        <p>Voltage-gated calcium channels are thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of seizures, including absence seizures. Cav3.1 and Cav3.2 channels, for example, are expressed on thalamocortical and reticular thalamic neurons, and alterations in their activity have been shown to result in absence seizures, which may occur as a result of various mutations in these channels. Specific seizure disorders have links with specific calcium channels. For example, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and juvenile absence epilepsy are associated with Cav3.2 (T-type) channel mutations. Importantly, more than 30 mutations have been found in just the Cav3.2 a1 subunit gene alone that have correlations with various types of epilepsies. Also, gain-of-function mutations have been found to affect the gating activity and plasma membrane trafficking of these channels. Increased seizure susceptibility associated with overexpression or overactivity of these channels also makes them an important target for treating absence seizures. Absence seizures are one of the hallmarks of idiopathic generalized epilepsy, which accounts for one-third of all epilepsies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r21">[21]</xref></p>
        <p>All addictive drugs share a common underlying pathophysiology in addiction in that they all can increase dopamine in the mesolimbic dopamine system and change CREB-dependent gene expression in the ventral segmental area and nucleus accumbens, whether it be through activation of opioid receptors (opioids), nicotinic receptors (nicotine), GABA receptors (alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines) or dopamine receptors (stimulants). Voltage-gated calcium channels are involved in these processes, which lead to several important neurobiological and behavioral changes associated with addiction. For example, changes in neuroplasticity associated with&#x000a0;stimulant&#x000a0;abuse appear to involve the CaV1 family of voltage-gated calcium channels. Increased glutamatergic activity on the VTA occurs upon activation of Cav1.3 channels resulting from chronic exposure to psychostimulants.</p>
        <p>The activity of Cav1.3 channels, along with increased glutamatergic activity in the VTA, causes NMDA and AMPA receptor-dependent changes in gene expression, which involves the upregulation of Cav1.2 receptors&#x000a0;in VTA neurons. Since the firing behavior of neurons in the VTA is differentially regulated by Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 channels, dopamine release is increased onto the D1 receptors of the NAc. This activity leads to the insertion of AMPA receptors onto the NAc neuron plasma membranes and mediates long-term changes in gene expression. Ultimately, these activities have been linked to behavioral sensitization to psychostimulants.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r21">[21]</xref></p>

        <p>Adrenergic receptors are important physiological mediators of both cardiovascular and smooth muscle activity. They are especially significant pharmacologically as they are the targets of a variety of drug classes, such as beta-blockers, alpha-blockers, and alpha-adrenergic receptor agonists. Epinephrine, a general adrenergic receptor activator, has a significant influence on cardiovascular and smooth muscle activity. This activity occurs in part through its actions on both the plasma membrane and intracellular calcium channels. In cardiac muscle, beta-adrenergic receptors are targeted by epinephrine and produce positive chronotropic, inotropic, and dromotropic physiological effects, which are mediated by their ability to increase the opening time of voltage-gated calcium channels. In vascular smooth muscle, both contraction and vascular tone are increased by norepinephrine by alpha-receptor activation due to its ability to increase cytosolic calcium levels through a depolarization-independent IP3-receptor-mediated mechanism.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r45">[45]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r46">[46]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r47">[47]</xref></p>

        <p>Calcium channel blockers have a variety of uses in medicine and are used to treat a variety of conditions, including but not limited to cardiac arrhythmia and hypertension. Also, there are currently several drugs used for bipolar disorder that block calcium channels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r28">[28]</xref>&#x000a0;Among the difficulties in utilizing calcium channel blockers for several diseases where they have implications is the development of calcium channel blockers that are selective for specific subtypes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r28">[28]</xref></p>
        <p>Because of the involvement of Cav2.2 channels in chronic pain states, they serve as a potentially important target for treating this condition. As stated previously, voltage-gated calcium channels are regulated by G-protein coupled receptors, and Cav2.2 channels are no exception. Both the GABAb receptor and various subtypes of opioid receptors affect the functioning of this channel. Morphine's ability to reduce the symptoms of chronic pain appears to be associated with its ability to mitigate primary afferent neuron activity by inhibiting the activity of Cav2.2 channels, resulting in a decrease in neurotransmitter release. Another group of drugs called the gabapentinoids also affects the activity of Cav2.2 channels but through a different mechanism. Overexpression of Cav2.2 channels in chronic pain states is thought to occur as a result of the upregulation of a2D subunits, which influence the cell-surface expression of these channels. By interfering with a2D subunit functioning, gabapentinoids appear to decrease presynaptic plasma membrane Cav2.2 channel density, thereby decreasing neurotransmitter release.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r48">[48]</xref></p>
        <p>Because of the involvement of T-type calcium channels in the absence seizure pathophysiology, pharmaceutical agents that target their activity may act as potent anti-epileptic drugs. The ability of T-type calcium channels to increase seizure susceptibility in the thalamus makes them an important clinical target for treating absence seizures. Drugs that inhibit specific subtypes of T-type calcium channel subunits would likely decrease absence seizure activity by reducing channel activity and expression. Mouse models of absence seizures exhibit resistance to drug-induced seizure activity when crossed with Cav3.1 T-type channel knockout mice, serving as an important clinical indicator of the importance of targeting this calcium channel in treating absence seizures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r21">[21]</xref></p>
        <p>&#x000a0;The variety of different calcium channels in myocardial cells contribute to different physiological activities associated with cardiovascular functioning, and mutations in these channels contribute to various diseases of the cardiovascular system. For example, the SERCA pump plays a vital role in mediating the positively chronotropic effects of beta-adrenergic stimulation because beta-adrenergic generates cAMP, which activates a protein kinase that phosphorylates phospholamban. When phospholamban is phosphorylated, it disinhibits the SERCA pump, increasing the rate of cytosolic uptake of calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum and decreasing the relaxation time of the heart during increased physical exertion. Mutations in the SERCA pump have been linked to dilated cardiomyopathy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r49">[49]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r46">[46]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The Na+/Ca+ exchanger is extremely important for healthy cardiovascular functioning. It exchanges sodium for calcium in a 3 to 1 ratio. This electrogenic action contributes to the voltage of the cardiac cell membrane and the subsequent direction of calcium flux, which favors calcium influx during systole and calcium efflux diastole.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r46">[46]</xref> The intracellular concentration has both inotropic and chronotropic implications on cardiac activity. Mutations in the Na+/Ca+ pump have been linked to heart failure and are an indirect target of drugs like digitalis. Finally, L-type calcium channels are also critical for normal cardiovascular functioning. It is responsible for initiating the cardiac action potential by providing the calcium influx to depolarize the cell. Also, they are involved in excitation-contraction coupling, which links calcium release to muscle contraction. L-type calcium channels are important targets for treating a variety of different cardiovascular diseases, such as ischemia, coronary vasospasm, and ischemia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r50">[50]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r45">[45]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r51">[51]</xref></p>
        <p>Calcium channel blockers are useful for the treatment of angina and related ischemic conditions because they ultimately exert a variety of physiological responses that affect the balance between myocardial oxygen supply and myocardial oxygen demand. DHP calcium channel blockers cause selective vasodilation of the coronary arteries and inhibit vascular smooth muscle contraction, which reduces vascular resistance, increases blood flow, and increases myocardial oxygen supply. Calcium channel blockers also decrease myocardial oxygen demand, determined by the contractile state of the heart, blood pressure, and heart rate. All calcium channel blockers reduce blood pressure, and this is achieved by peripheral vasodilation, which in turn reduces blood pressure. Non-DHP calcium channel blockers are active at the heart's nodal areas, where they decrease calcium influx and reduce the rate of depolarization in cardiac pacemaker cells, thereby reducing heart rate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r45">[45]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r51">[51]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r52">[52]</xref></p>
        <p>The dromotropic effects of calcium channel blockers like verapamil and diltiazem can be linked to their ability to interact within the SA and AV nodal cardiac cells. They cause blockage of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels at these sites, which reduces pacemaker cell depolarization and subsequent firing rate. This effect is beneficial during the treatment of angina and related ischemic conditions because it reduces the heart's oxygen demand. Because this pacemaker cell depolarization depends on T-type calcium channels as well, they do not achieve total depression of sinal rhythmic activity. In contrast, short-acting nifedipine-like calcium channel blockers, when administered in short-acting formulations, may increase heart rate as a result of reflex tachycardia, which occurs when significant vascular smooth muscle vasodilation causes a rapid decrease in blood pressure, which, in turn, increases sympathetic activity. As a result, they may exacerbate the symptoms of angina and related ischemic conditions of the cardiovascular system by increasing the heart's oxygen demand.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r45">[45]</xref>&#x000a0;These drugs are particularly prone to cause dizziness due to the rapid decrease in blood pressure that occurs upon their administration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r51">[51]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r53">[53]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r51">[51]</xref></p>
        <p>&#x000a0;The inotropic action of calcium channel blockers plays an essential role in improving symptoms of angina because it reduces oxygen demand. However, this is also responsible for their ability to exacerbate conditions such as heart failure, in which the heart does not pump sufficient amounts of blood. For short-acting DHP calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine, their negative inotropic effect may be counteracted by reflex sympathetic stimulation due to rapidly reduced systemic vascular resistance. Sympathetic stimulation directly enhances cardiac contractility by increasing the calcium influx and, therefore, the availability of calcium for the heart's contractile apparatus. In angina, a decrease in cardiac contractility is particularly beneficial as it increases the heart's oxygen supply by reducing metabolic demand. Finally, concerning the negative chronotropic effect of the heart by calcium channel blockers, it is important to note that their ability to depress heart rate depends on their ability to inhibit adrenergic transmitters release and the ability of the heart to adjust sympathetic tone reflexively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r45">[45]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r50">[50]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r53">[53]</xref></p>
        <p>&#x000a0;In addition to affecting both myocardial oxygen supply and demand, calcium channel blockers are beneficial for certain diseases of the cardiovascular system because they reduce the heart's workload. Vasodilation of the systemic veins, for example, reduces pre-load. Afterload is also reduced because vascular resistance to blood flow decreases. Two separate mechanisms are responsible for this, inhibition of myogenic tone in vascular smooth muscle and a decrease in responsiveness to vasoconstricting substances like norepinephrine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r45">[45]</xref>&#x000a0;The latter two effects are particularly prevalent in drugs like verapamil and nifedipine. The workload of the heart is also reduced by restricting the entry of calcium into myocardial cells, which decreases ventricular contraction frequency and thereby decreases the ventricular pressure at the end of diastole and also decreases the pressure on the ventricular walls.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r45">[45]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r50">[50]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r53">[53]</xref></p>
        <p>&#x000a0;In diseases that restrict coronary blood flow, calcium channel blockers exert several beneficial effects. By decreasing the heart rate, the ventricular filling time of the heart is increased, which increases the efficiency of the pumping of blood by the heart. Furthermore, The reduction of ventricular wall tension that occurs due to vascular smooth muscle dilation works by improving perfusion. During anoxic conditions, calcium channel blockers prevent the exaggerated accumulation of calcium by inhibiting calcium influx, which increases the redistribution of blood to ischemic regions. Patients with angina benefit from the inhibition of vascular smooth muscle contraction via blockade of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, which dilate the coronary vessels and increase blood flow. The reduction of coronary vasospasm is a significant clinical effect of CCBs because it is the primary cause of ischemia in those with angina.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r50">[50]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r51">[51]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r53">[53]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18776.r51">[51]</xref></p>
