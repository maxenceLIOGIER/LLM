        <p content-type="pubmed-excerpt">A personal health record (PHR) refers to the collection of an individual's medical documentation maintained by the individual or a caregiver in cases where patients are unable to do so themselves. This personal information includes details such as:</p>

        <p>Any other information the patient feels is pertinent may also be included. This contrasts with electronic medical records (EMR) and electronic health records (EHR), which are usually maintained by the treating physician or hospital to provide medical care and for billing purposes. A PHR may be either physical or, as has become increasingly common moving forward, electronic. This includes all self-reported and self-recorded health data, including health issues and treatments, records of vital signs and activity recorded with personal devices including smartphones and smartwatches, nutritional data such as diet composition and calorie intake, etc. Several commercial applications are available that allow an individual to maintain a PHR, and some also allow integration of this data with the individual's EMR/EHR, allowing them to take better charge of their own health. The goal of a PHR is&#x000a0;to allow the patient to keep their health data on hand for ready access for both themselves and anyone involved in their care while maintaining the privacy and security of this data. A PHR can hence assist in providing tailored medical care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27048.r1">[1]</xref></p>

        <title>Clinical Significance</title>
        <p>PHRs are seeing widespread adoption in today's digital age, and physicians must adapt to this new data source. Interpreted correctly, a PHR can provide valuable data points to assess the clinical course before the presentation and provide a level of fidelity that could not be achieved by traditional patient interviews alone. This concept represents a crucial component of shared decision-making by the patient and their physician.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27048.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Used correctly, PHRs can improve patient adherence to follow-up, allow patients to better monitor therapeutic goals such as blood pressure or blood glucose thresholds, allow recognition of improvement or worsening of control of existing medical conditions, improve compliance with medication regimens, especially when these regimens are complex&#x02014;all of which culminate in the achievement of superior management of medical issues.</p>
        <p>However, critical analysis is necessary, as many of these devices and applications use one-size-fits-all algorithms that may result in false positives and false negatives in interpreting medical conditions. Patients must be counseled about interpreting and acting on health data in close cooperation with their healthcare provider in order to avoid unwarranted anxiety or concerns over minor normal variations that are interpreted as something more sinister. This is especially of concern in a setting where PHRs are interlinked with EMR/EHR systems that provide patients with real-time test results that are yet to be interpreted and clinically correlated by a clinician. Moreover, PHRs may also contribute to a state of "information overload" "whereby extraneous data in a PHR becomes noise that can garble the signal of pertinent health information in the healthcare setting.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27048.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;In this setting, the upcoming use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the processing of patient data may serve as a useful adjunct in highlighting true abnormalities and helping determine action signals that necessitate healthcare intervention. This can allow healthcare providers to look past the vast mountain of data and detect significant findings from the repository of information within an individual's HR.</p>

        <title>Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions</title>
        <p>A caveat of PHRs is the importance of presenting information to the layperson in a manner that simplifies the concepts while retaining the accuracy and veracity of facts. This may depend heavily on the involvement of sensitized healthcare professionals from various disciplines for the development of PHR platforms, as they would be best poised to recognize cognitive errors of reporting and interpretation that may affect the use of PHRs by the public at large. All of this data must be handled within the confines of maintaining patient privacy while sharing data as necessary for medical purposes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27048.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>Allied health providers can significantly contribute to developing individual PHRs by counseling and educating persons on the benefits and shortcomings of various platforms, the relevance of data recorded to their clinical problems, and filtering this data to make interpretation more straightforward for clinicians and other healthcare personnel (eg, nurses, therapists, techs, pharmacists) involved in the patient's care. A multi-disciplinary approach to creating PHRs, constant study and improvement of PHR design by a team of pan-professional individuals, and post-marketing surveillance of usage data, successes, and pitfalls are all critical components of developing this modality as a fresh addition to the healthcare armamentarium.</p>
