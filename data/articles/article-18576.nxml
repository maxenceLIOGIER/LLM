        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Although breast cancer is typically synonymous with a disease that commonly occurs in women, it does occur in men&#x000a0;as well. This is because although minimal in quantity, men do&#x000a0;have breast tissue that has the potential to become malignant similarly to women, albeit much less commonly. While male breast cancer (MBC) is rare, only occurring in 1% of all breast cancers, it does occur, and it is important to be cognizant of its reality and potential.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18576.r1">[1]</xref> In the United States (US), there are about 2800 cases of male breast cancer annually. Unfortunately, men with breast cancer are often diagnosed late and have high mortality. However, stage for stage, the survival between men and women is similar.</p>

      <sec id="article-18576.s3" sec-type="Etiology">
        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>When discussing the etiology of breast cancer in. men, one must uncover the potential&#x000a0;genetic or environmental&#x000a0;risk factors. Being mindful that the majority of males diagnosed with MBC have no identifiable risk other than increasing age (average age of diagnosis of 71) is important.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18576.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Similar to women, men have a higher risk of breast cancer if they have a first- or second-degree relative with breast cancer. Studies have shown that an affected sibling or parent of either gender may increase the risk of breast cancer in either the males or females in the family. Bevier et al (2012) noted in their study that the relative risk (RR) of breast cancer was similar in either offspring when the father or mother was affected&#x000a0;(RR= 1.73 and 1.74, respectively), but the risk was slightly higher in the females when the brother is affected as opposed to when the sister is affected&#x000a0;(RR= 2.48 and 1.39, respectively).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18576.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Also, in addition to a family history of breast cancer, males with a<italic toggle="yes"> BRCA</italic> mutation appear to have an increased risk for breast cancer&#x000a0;as well. Although it is rare for a male to have a BRCA mutation, those with a&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">BRCA2</italic> carrier mutation have a 6% increased risk, and BRCA1 has a 4% risk of developing the disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18576.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;Other genetic disorders have been implicated in increasing the risk of MBC, including Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY), Cowden syndrome (<italic toggle="yes">PTEN</italic> tumor suppressor gene), Li-Fraumeni syndrome (<italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>), Lynch syndrome (<italic toggle="yes">PALB2</italic> and mismatch repair genes).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18576.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18576.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>The alterations in estrogen-to-androgen ratios are important to note when discussing the etiology of male breast cancer. Estrogen, which stimulates ductal development in breasts, has also been implicated as a potential risk factor for MBC, similar to women. Klinefelter syndrome, as previously mentioned, may increase the risk of MBC through excess estrogen stimulation. Other potential triggers have also been identified and include obesity, marijuana use, hepatic dysfunction, thyroid disease, and estrogen-containing medications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18576.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Likewise, a decrease in circulating androgens would result in elevations of the estrogen ratios, and this may occur from conditions such as cryptorchidism, orchitis, and orchiectomy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18576.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>Lastly, environmental factors have also been implicated in the possibility of increasing the risk of male breast cancer. As with women, previous radiation therapy has been noted as a potential risk factor. Of note, radiotherapy has been used to treat gynecomastia, but these patients have been found to have a 7-fold increase in the risk of MBC.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18576.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;In addition, certain occupations have been found to increase the risk of MBC, including steel and rolling mills, as well as occupations involved with organic solvents such as trichloroethylene.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18576.r7">[7]</xref></p>

        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>Breast cancer in men is a relatively rare malignancy when compared to breast cancer in women, with a known ratio of 1 case in men to 100 in women, and occurs in about 1% of all breast cancers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18576.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Breast cancers in men, in general, account for 0.5% of all cancer diagnoses in men, but there has been recent concern about the rising incidence in the past few decades.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18576.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Studies have facilitated the hypothesis that in addition to obesity and alcohol, dietary factors may be exacerbating the incidence of MBC, but concrete research and evidence regarding specific dietary patterns have yet to be established.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18576.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;Despite these plausible associations, many individuals who are diagnosed with male breast cancer&#x000a0;have no identifiable risk factors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18576.r8">[8]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-18576.s5" sec-type="Histopathology">
        <title>Histopathology</title>
        <p>The most common type of breast cancer seen in men is invasive ductal carcinoma, which constitutes approximately 90% of all male breast cancers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18576.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;Other types implicated are medullary, papilloma, and lobular. Ductal carcinoma in situ is not commonly found due to a lack of awareness and stigmas related to MBC. This then leads to delayed diagnosis and poorer outcomes for the patients. In breast cancer in men, approximately 90% express the estrogen receptor (ER), and 81% express the progesterone receptor.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18576.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;Study results have also found that the expression of these hormone receptors is more prevalent than breast cancer in women.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18576.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;Thus, adjuvant therapy is usually predicated on the inhibition of these receptors, which is discussed further in the treatment and management section.</p>

        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>Men commonly present to the clinic complaining of a painless mass in a unilateral breast. Other potential symptoms include nipple retraction, nipple discharge, ulceration, and pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18576.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Masses in men are typically easier to appreciate than in women due to the smaller breast size, although gynecomastia may mask the condition. Also, when discussing the history of presenting illness, it is vital to discuss the potential family history of breast cancer, the patient&#x02019;s past medical history, occupation, and whether there has been previous estrogen or radiation exposure.</p>

      <sec id="article-18576.s7" sec-type="Evaluation">
        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>Similar to breast cancer in women, the diagnosis of MBC is made by a triple assessment, which includes clinical assessment, mammography, ultrasonography, and core biopsy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18576.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;Mammography is an effective diagnostic method with a&#x000a0;sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 90%; although due to size and volume differences in male breasts, this modality may be limited&#x000a0;at times. Given this, ultrasound-guided core biopsy gives the most definitive diagnosis of MBC and is preferred over fine-needle aspiration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18576.r10">[10]</xref></p>

        <p>Treatment and management of male breast cancer&#x000a0;typically follow the same rationale as breast cancer in women, which consists of resection followed by adjuvant endocrine therapy, chemotherapy (CT), or radiotherapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18576.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;Management is guided by prognostic factors and is further discussed in the oncology section.</p>

        <p>For early-stage disease (T1-T2, N0-N1), simple or modified radical mastectomies that do not involve the additional removal of the pectoralis muscle have been found to be the preferred choice of resection because retrospective studies have not shown mortality or reoccurrence benefit with radical approaches of resections.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18576.r13">[13]</xref>&#x000a0;Axillary or sentinel lymph node biopsies are typically obtained as well to further designate prognostic factors.

Due to the limitations of data, the indications of CT in male breast cancer have been taken from female breast cancer indications and include positive lymph nodes with tumor size greater than 1 cm and negative hormone receptors. Given these indications, oncologists typically select hormonal therapy first, and in the event of failure of this treatment modality, do they consider the role of CT?<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18576.r12">[12]</xref></p>

        <p>Routine screening of men with breast cancer&#x000a0;is not established due to the rarity of occurrence.

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>Breast cancer in men is rare, and often the diagnosis is delayed, leading to very high mortality. To improve outcomes, an interprofessional team approach that consists of an oncologist, surgeon, radiation therapist, dietitian, and mental health counselor is recommended. The majority of these patients initially present to their primary care provider or nurse practitioner. Unlike females, there may not be any risk factors, and hence any mass should be worked up, and a malignancy&#x000a0;ruled out. The primary care providers should never assume that breast growth is simply benign gynecomastia. Men who are older than 50 should be worked up to rule out breast cancer if there is a lesion.</p>
        <p>Once diagnosed, the pharmacist should educate the patient on chemotherapeutic drugs, and the oncology nurse and clinician should discuss radiation therapy and its benefits. An aspect of breast cancer in men that is frequently overlooked is the negative stigmas that these patients routinely face, which leads them to feel quite isolated and vulnerable. Psychosocial support through various interprofessional teams should be offered to allow for a more normalization of their condition and experience as well as to create an atmosphere of nonjudgmental dialogue to address their concerns and potential stigmas. Open communication between the interprofessional team should ensure that the patient is provided with the optimal standard of care. Long-term follow-up by the primary care provider&#x000a0;and nurse practitioner is necessary as males are prone to developing recurrences in both breasts.</p>
