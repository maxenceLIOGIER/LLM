        <p>Family and domestic violence is a common problem in the United States, affecting an estimated 10 million people every year; as many as one in four women and one in nine men are victims of domestic violence. Virtually all healthcare professionals will at some point evaluate or treat a patient who is a victim of domestic or family violence. Domestic and family violence includes economic, physical, sexual, emotional, and psychological abuse of children, adults, or elders. Domestic violence causes worsened psychological and physical health, decreased quality of life, decreased productivity, and in some cases, mortality. Domestic and family violence can be difficult to identify. Many cases are not reported to health professionals or legal authorities. This activity describes the evaluation, reporting, and management strategies for victims of domestic abuse and stresses the role of team-based interprofessional care for these victims.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Family and domestic violence including child abuse, intimate partner abuse, and elder abuse is a common problem in the United States. Family and domestic health violence are estimated to affect 10 million people in the United States every year. It is a national public health problem, and virtually all healthcare professionals will at some point evaluate or treat a patient who is a victim of some form of domestic or family violence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40654.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40654.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40654.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40654.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40654.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>Unfortunately, each form of family violence begets interrelated forms of violence. The "cycle of abuse" is often continued from exposed children into their adult relationships and finally&#x000a0;to the care of the elderly.</p>
        <p>Domestic and family violence includes a range of abuse, including economic, physical, sexual, emotional, and psychological, toward children, adults, and elders.</p>
        <p>Intimate partner violence includes&#x000a0;stalking,&#x000a0;sexual and physical violence, and psychological aggression by a current or former partner. In the United States, as many as&#x000a0;one in four women and one in nine men are victims of domestic violence. Domestic violence is thought to be underreported. Domestic violence affects the victim, families, co-workers, and community. It causes&#x000a0;diminished psychological and physical health, decreases the quality of life, and results in decreased productivity.</p>
        <p>The national economic cost of domestic and family violence is estimated to be over 12 billion dollars per year. The number of individuals affected is expected to rise over the next 20 years, increasing the elderly population.</p>
        <p>Domestic and family violence is difficult to identify, and many cases go unreported to health professionals or legal authorities. Due to the prevalence in our society, all healthcare professionals, including psychologists, nurses, pharmacists, dentists, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and physicians, will evaluate and possibly treat a victim or perpetrator of domestic or family violence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40654.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40654.r7">[7]</xref></p>

</bold>
</p>
        <p>Domestic violence, spousal abuse, battering, or intimate partner violence, is typically the victimization of an individual with whom the abuser has an intimate or romantic relationship. The CDC defines domestic violence as "physical violence, sexual violence, stalking, and psychological aggression (including coercive acts) by a current or former intimate partner."</p>
        <p>Domestic and family violence has no boundaries. This violence occurs in intimate relationships regardless of culture, race, religion, or socioeconomic status. All healthcare professionals must&#x000a0;understand that domestic violence, whether in the form of emotional, psychological, sexual, or physical violence, is common in our society and should develop the ability to recognize it and make the appropriate&#x000a0;referral.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Violence Abuse Types</bold>
</p>
        <p>The types of&#x000a0;violence include stalking, economic, emotional or psychological, sexual, neglect, Munchausen by proxy, and physical. Domestic and family violence occurs in all races, ages, and sexes. It knows no cultural, socioeconomic, education, religious, or geographic limitation. It may occur in individuals with different sexual orientations.</p>

<bold>Risk Factors</bold>
</p>
        <p>Risk factors for domestic and family violence include individual, relationship, community, and societal issues. There is an inverse relationship between education and domestic violence. Lower&#x000a0;education&#x000a0;levels correlate with more likely domestic violence. Childhood abuse is commonly associated with becoming a perpetrator of domestic violence as an adult. Perpetrators of domestic violence commonly repeat acts of violence with new partners. Drug and alcohol abuse greatly&#x000a0;increases the incidence of domestic violence.</p>
        <p>Children who are victims or witness domestic and family violence may believe that&#x000a0;violence is a reasonable way to resolve a conflict. Males who learn that females are not equally respected are more likely to abuse females in adulthood. Females who witness domestic violence as children are more likely to be victimized by their spouses. While females are often the victim of domestic violence, gender roles can be reversed.</p>
        <p>Domination may include emotional, physical, or sexual abuse that may be caused by an interaction of situational and individual factors. This means the abuser learns violent behavior from their family, community, or culture. They see violence and are victims of violence.</p>

      <sec id="article-40654.s4" sec-type="Epidemiology">
        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>Domestic violence is a serious and challenging public health problem. Approximately 1 in 3 women and 1 in 10&#x000a0;men 18 years of age or older experience domestic violence. Annually, domestic violence is responsible for over 1500 deaths in the United States.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40654.r11">[11]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40654.r12">[12]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40654.r13">[13]</xref></p>
        <p>Domestic violence victims typically experience severe physical injuries requiring care at a hospital or clinic. The cost to individuals and society is significant. The national annual cost of medical and mental health care services related to acute domestic violence is estimated at over $8 billion. If the injury results in a long-term or chronic condition, the cost is considerably higher.</p>
        <p>Financial hardship and unemployment are contributors to domestic violence. An economic downturn is associated with increased calls to the National Domestic Violence Hotline.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, the national rate of nonfatal domestic violence is declining. This is thought to be due to a decline in the marriage rate, decreased domesticity, better access to domestic violence shelters, improvements in female economic status, and an increase in the average age of the population.</p>

        <p>
<bold>Child Abuse</bold>
</p>
        <p>Age, family income, and ethnicity are all risk factors for both sexual abuse and physical abuse. Gender is a risk factor for sexual abuse but not for physical abuse.<bold/></p>
        <p>Each year there are over 3 million referrals to child protective authorities. Despite often being the first to examine the victims, only about 10% of the referrals were from medical personnel. The fatality rate is approximately two deaths per 100,000 children. Women account for a little over half of the perpetrators.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Intimate Partner Violence</bold>
</p>
        <p>According to the CDC, 1 in 4&#x000a0;women and 1 in 7&#x000a0;men will experience physical violence by their intimate partner at some point&#x000a0;during their lifetimes. About 1 in 3&#x000a0;women and nearly 1 in 6 men experience some form of sexual violence during their lifetimes. Intimate partner violence, sexual violence, and stalking are high, with intimate partner violence occurring in over 10 million people each year.</p>
        <p>One in 6&#x000a0;women and 1 in 19 men have experienced stalking during their lifetimes. The majority are stalked by someone they know. An intimate partner stalks about 6 in 10 female victims and 4 in 10 male victims.</p>
        <p>At least 5 million acts of domestic violence occur annually to women aged 18 years and older, with over 3 million involving men. While most events are minor, for example grabbing, shoving, pushing, slapping, and hitting, serious and sometimes fatal injuries do&#x000a0;occur. Approximately 1.5 million intimate partner female rapes and physical assaults are perpetrated annually, and approximately 800,000 male assaults occur. About 1 in 5 women have experienced completed or attempted rape at some point&#x000a0;in their lives. About 1% to 2% of men have experienced completed or attempted rape.</p>
        <p>The incidence of intimate partner violence has declined by over 60%, from about ten&#x000a0;victimizations per 1000 persons age 12 or older to approximately 4 per 1000.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Elderly</bold>
</p>
        <p>Due to underreporting and difficulty sampling, obtaining accurate incidence information on elder abuse and neglect is difficult. Elderly abuse is thought to occur in 3% to 10% of the population of elders.</p>
        <p>Elderly patients may not report due to fear, guilt, ignorance, or shame. Clinicians underreport elder abuse due to poor recognition of the problem, lack of understanding of reporting methods and requirements, and concerns about physician-patient confidentiality.</p>

        <p>Imaging: Skeletal Survey</p>
        <p>A skeletal survey is indicated in children younger than 2 years with suspected physical abuse. The incidence of occult fractures is as high as 1 in 4 in physically abused children younger than 2 years. The clinician should consider screening&#x000a0;all siblings younger than 2 years.</p>
        <p>The skeletal survey should include 2 views of each extremity; anteroposterior and lateral skull; and lateral chest, spine, abdomen, pelvis, hands, and feet. A radiologist should review the films for classic metaphyseal lesions and healing fractures, most often involving the posterior ribs. A &#x0201c;babygram&#x0201d; that includes only 1 film of the entire body is not an adequate skeletal survey.</p>
        <p>Skeletal fractures will remodel at different rates, which are&#x000a0;dependent on the age, location, and nutritional status of the patient.</p>

        <p>Domestic violence may be difficult to uncover when the victim is frightened, especially when&#x000a0;he or she presents to an emergency department or healthcare practitioner's office. The key is to establish an assessment protocol and maintain an awareness of the possibility that domestic and family violence may be the cause of the patient&#x02019;s signs and symptoms.</p>
        <p>Over 80% of victims of domestic and family violence seek care in a hospital; others may seek care in health professional offices, including dentists, therapists, and other medical offices. Routine screening should be conducted by all healthcare practitioners including nurses, physicians, physician assistants, dentists, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists. Interprofessional coordination of screening is a critical component of protecting victims and minimizing negative health outcomes. Health professional team interventions reduce the incidence of morbidity and mortality associated with domestic violence. Documentation is vital and a legal obligation.</p>
