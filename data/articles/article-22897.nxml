<bold>What is the function of HIPAA?</bold>
</p>
        <p>In passing the law for HIPAA, Congress required the establishment of federal standards to guarantee electronically protected health information security to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of health information that ensure the protection of individual's health information while also granting access to healthcare providers, clearinghouses, and health plans for continued medical care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22897.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22897.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22897.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Standards for security were needed because of the growth in the exchange of protected health information between covered and non-covered entities. These standards guarantee the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). Also, there are State laws with strict guidelines that apply and overrule federal security guidelines.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>The standards mandated in the Federal Security Rule protect individuals' health information while permitting appropriate access to that information by healthcare providers, clearinghouses, and health insurance plans. The Federal Security Rule establishes federal standards to ensure the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of ePHI. Also, state laws provide more stringent standards that apply over and above federal security standards.</p>

          <list-item>
            <p>Healthcare providers, health plans, and business associates have a strong tradition of safeguarding private health information. However, the old system of paper records locked in cabinets is not enough in today's world anymore. With information broadly held and transmitted electronically, the rule provides clear national standards for protecting electronic health information.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22897.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22897.r10">[10]</xref></p>

<bold>Privacy Rule</bold>
<bold/>
</p>
        <p>The HIPAA Privacy Rule regulates the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI) by "covered entities." These entities include healthcare clearinghouses, health insurers, employer-sponsored health plans, and medical providers. Upon request, covered entities must disclose PHI to an individual within 30 days. In addition, entities mentioned earlier must provide and disclose PHI as required by law enforcement to investigate suspected child abuse.</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>

          <list-item>
            <p>When a covered entity discloses PHI, it must make a reasonable effort to share only the minimum necessary information.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>The Privacy Rule gives individuals the right to demand that a covered entity correct any inaccurate PHI and take reasonable steps to ensure the confidentiality of communications with individuals.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>The Privacy Rule requires covered entities to notify individuals of PHI use, keep track of disclosures, and document privacy policies and procedures.</p>

        </list>
        <p><bold>2013 Omnibus Rule update:&#x000a0;</bold>The revised definition of "significant harm" to an individual in the analysis of a breach provides more investigation to cover entities intending to disclose breaches that were previously not reported. Protection of PHI was changed from indefinite to 50 years after death. The HIPAA Privacy rule may be waived during a natural disaster.</p>
        <p><bold>Right to access:&#x000a0;</bold>The Privacy Rule requires medical providers to give individuals PHI access when an individual requests information in writing. A provider has 30 days to provide a copy of the information to the individual. After that, an individual may request the information in electronic form or hard copy.</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">

        <p>
<bold>Transactions and Code Sets Rule </bold>
<bold/>
</p>
        <p>HIPAA was created to improve healthcare system efficiency by standardizing healthcare transactions. HIPAA added a new Part C titled "Administrative Simplification" that&#x000a0;simplifies healthcare transactions by requiring health plans to standardize healthcare transactions.</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>For example, medical providers who file for reimbursements must file electronic claims using HIPAA standards to be paid.</p>

        </list>
        <p>
<bold>Security Rule</bold>
</p>
        <p>The Security Rule complements the Privacy Rule. While the Privacy Rule pertains to all PHI, the Security Rule is limited to&#x000a0;ePHI. It lays out three security safeguards: administrative, physical, and technical.</p>
        <p><bold>Administrative safeguards:&#x000a0;</bold>Policies and procedures are designed to show clearly how the entity will comply with the act. Covered entities must adopt a written set of privacy procedures and designate a privacy officer to develop and implement required policies and procedures. Procedures must identify classes of employees with access to&#x000a0;ePHI and restrict it to only those who need it to complete their job function. The procedures must address access authorization, establishment, modification, and termination. Entities must show appropriate ongoing training for handling PHI. Covered entities must back up their data and have disaster recovery procedures. Internal audits are required to review operations to identify security violations. Procedures should document instructions for addressing and responding to security breaches.</p>
        <p><bold>Physical safeguards: </bold>Procedures must control physical access to protected data by introducing and removing&#x000a0;hardware and software from the network and limiting it to authorized individuals.&#x000a0;Procedures must also control and monitor access to equipment containing PHI. Workstations must be set up properly, ensuring monitor screens are out of direct public view. If the covered entities utilize contractors or agents, they, too, must be thoroughly trained on PHI.</p>
        <p><bold>Technical safeguards:&#x000a0;</bold>Safeguards include controlling access to computer systems and enabling covered entities to protect communications containing&#x000a0;ePHI over open networks.</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>

<bold>Unique identifiers rule (National Provider Identifier, NPI)</bold>
</p>
        <p>HIPAA-covered entities such as providers completing electronic transactions, healthcare clearinghouses, and large health plans must use only the National Provider Identifier (NPI) to identify covered healthcare providers in standard transactions.</p>
        <p>The NPI replaces all other identifiers used by health plans, Medicare, Medicaid, and other government programs. The NPI does not replace a provider's DEA, state license, or tax identification numbers. The NPI is ten digits (may be alphanumeric), with the last digit a checksum. The NPI cannot contain any embedded intelligence; the NPI is a number that does not have any additional meaning. The NPI is unique and national, never re-used, and except for institutions, a provider usually can have only one. An institution may obtain multiple NPIs for different "sub-parts," such as a free-standing surgery or wound care center.&#x000a0;</p>

        <title>Clinical Significance</title>
        <p>HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules have substantially changed how medical institutions and health providers function. The complex legalities, severe civil and financial penalties, and increased paperwork and implementation costs have substantially impacted health care. All health professionals must be trained in HIPAA and understand the potential pitfalls and acts that can lead to a violation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22897.r15">[15]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22897.r16">[16]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Clinical Care Effects</bold>
</p>
        <p>HIPAA, combined with stiff penalties for violation, may result in medical centers and practices withholding life-saving information from those who may have a right to it and need it at a crucial moment. Through the&#x000a0;HIPAA Privacy Rule, the&#x000a0;US Government Accountability Office found that healthcare providers were "uncertain about their legal privacy responsibilities and often responded with an overly guarded approach to disclosing information. Ultimately, the solution is the education of all healthcare professionals and their support staff so that they fully appreciate when&#x000a0;PHI can be legally released.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Education and Training Effects</bold>
</p>
        <p>Education and training of healthcare providers and students are needed to implement HIPAA Privacy and Security Acts. Practical training and education must describe the regulatory background and purpose of HIPAA and provide a review of the principles and key provisions of the Privacy Rule.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Research Effects</bold>
</p>
        <p>HIPAA restrictions on research have affected the ability to perform chart-based retrospective research. This has made it challenging to evaluate patients&#x000a0;prospectively&#x000a0;for follow-up.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22897.r12">[12]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22897.r17">[17]</xref></p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>HIPAA Privacy rules have resulted in as much as a 95% drop in follow-up surveys completed by patients being followed long-term.</p>

          <list-item>
            <p>Recruitment of patients for cancer studies has led to a more than 70% decrease in patient accrual and a tripling of time spent recruiting patients and mean recruitment costs.</p>

          <list-item>
            <p>The legal language required for research studies is now extensive due to the need to protect participants' health information. While such information is important, a lengthy legalistic section may make these complex documents less user-friendly for those asked to read and sign them.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>Many researchers believe that HIPAA privacy laws harm the cost and quality of medical research.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22897.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Costs</bold>
</p>
        <p>HIPAA Privacy and Security Acts require all medical centers and medical practices to enter and comply. The costs of developing and revamping systems and practices and increasing paperwork and staff education time have impacted the finances of medical centers and practices when insurance companies and Medicare reimbursements have decreased. Ultimately, the cost of violating the statutes is so substantial that scarce resources must be devoted to ensuring an institution is compliant and its employees understand the statutory rules.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Conclusions</bold>
</p>
        <p>HIPAA is a potential minefield of violations that almost any medical professional can commit. Staff with less education and understanding can easily violate these rules during the normal course of work. While a small percentage of criminal violations involve personal gain or nosy behavior, most are momentary lapses resulting in costly mistakes. Writing an incorrect address, phone number, email, or text on a form or expressing protected information aloud can jeopardize a practice. HIPAA education and training are crucial, as well as designing and maintaining systems that minimize human mistakes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22897.r18">[18]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22897.r19">[19]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22897.r20">[20]</xref></p>
