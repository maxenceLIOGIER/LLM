        <p content-type="pubmed-excerpt">Patient Self Determination Act (PDSA) was an amendment proposed&#x000a0;in 1990 and functions to amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicare and Medicaid, respectively). The PSDA mandates that hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, hospice organizations, home health organizations, and HMO's perform a number of specific actions and ensure that other certain conditions are met. Among those mentioned above, it is required that patients be informed of their right to be involved&#x000a0;in making decisions&#x000a0;with regard to the medical care they receive. It is also required that the patient is asked about advance directives, and to document any wishes the patient might have with regard to the care they want or do not want. It required that no discrimination take place by any healthcare organization against any patient&#x000a0;putting forth advance directives. It mandates that patient advance directives be implemented if necessary, assuming those wishes are legally valid and permissible by State law. It requires education programs&#x000a0;including advance directives, bioethics, patient wishes, and the concept of patient self-determination. The PDSA went further to instruct the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services to coordinate an investigative study&#x000a0;reviewing the implementation of advance directive decisions. PDSA also&#x000a0;asked to create and perform projects in specific locations across the country to build awareness of patient rights in the area of advance directives and executing advance directives.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>As listed on the legislative portion of the 101st Congress, the bill reads as the following:</p>

        <title>Issues of Concern</title>
        <p>There were several areas of concern surrounding the passage of this amendment. At the time, individual physicians were concerned about accusations of assisting suicide if withdrawing IV fluids, feeding tubes, etc., as it was not yet certain how the law would treat any subsequent accusations&#x000a0;toward those trying to implement the PSDA into their clinical practice. There was a concern for malpractice liability if difficulty arose in implementing patient wishes for any reason. There was concern about physicians having to adapt their own moral compass, treating patients in a way they might not have before the passage of PSDA. There was concern that other individuals, from family and friends to insurance companies, might get involved and obstruct a physician from implementing a patient's wishes or advance directives. Over the decades, many of these concerns have been put to rest as the amendment approaches its 30th anniversary. Nevertheless, there&#x000a0;are new concerns and complexities that arise with the dynamic status of healthcare delivery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26769.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26769.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26769.r7">[7]</xref></p>

        <title>Clinical Significance</title>
        <p>The clinical significance of the PSDA is severalfold. It made an official stance on advance directives and the requirement to inform patients of their rights under state laws. It empowers patients to play a role in the decision-making process of their healthcare delivery. It aimed to prevent over- and under-treatment by arriving at a patient's specific wishes and having those wishes executed if the patient is unable to dictate their wishes in real time due to incapacitation. It also sought to permit decreased costs by giving patients the option to elect or decline expensive critical care/ICU interventions in the face of certain death due to terminal illness or catastrophic injury. Approaching 30 years since its acceptance, the PSDA remains controversial in its implementation and successes. Nevertheless, the innovative amendment changed the face of healthcare for millions of people: patients, their families, and their healthcare providers alike. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26769.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26769.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26769.r10">[10]</xref></p>

        <title>Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions</title>
        <p>The interprofessional team, including both clinicians and nurses, has an ethical duty to ensure patients know and understand their healthcare-related rights. By providing a holistic and integrated approach, it can lead to improved outcomes regarding comprehension for the patient and their family. The PSDA has expansive applications to the nursing field, both regarding actions and interventions. Taking the time to understand the PSDA legislation and how it applies to patients and the care delivered by nursing staff will improve the quality of both care and communications.</p>
