        <p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a member of the Herpesviridae family, which has the largest genome of any herpes virus.

CMV can affect many organs, including the eyes, stomach, colon, but the focus of this discussion is on the esophagus. This article goes into the etiology, presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of cytomegalovirus esophagitis.

        <p>In the immunocompetent, CMV replication is kept under control through antibodies against key viral surface glycoproteins and cell-mediated immune response carried out by NK cell, CD4, and CD8 T cells. Disease in the immunocompromised can result from reactivation of the latent virus, newly acquired infection, or reinfection with a new strain. Reactivation in immunocompromised patients is the result of dysfunction in cell-mediated immunity rather than humoral immunity.&#x000a0;Patients typically have enough anti-CMV antibodies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20237.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;It is their poorly functional CD4 and CD8 T cell responses to mono and polyfunctional cytokine production, which fail to control CMV replication.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20237.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;Moreover, the virus itself is also able to encode proteins that interfere with class I and class II HLA response, NK cell activities, the cell cycle, apoptotic and inflammatory pathways that typically act to contain this pathogen.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20237.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>Mucosal infection by CMV leads to inflammation and tissue necrosis, vascular endothelial involvement, and, ultimately, ischemic mucosal injury.

        <p>There is no pathognomonic endoscopic feature for CMV esophagitis, and definitive diagnosis depends heavily on biopsy findings. Histopathological diagnosis can be made by identifying CMV inclusion bodies with standard H&#x00026;E staining, called a cytomegalic cell.

        <p>Although immunocompetent patients may be infected with CMV, it rarely causes active disease in such patients. In healthy adults, most primary CMV infections are either asymptomatic or present as a mild mononucleosis-like syndrome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20237.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The active disease almost always occurs through reactivation or reinfection in the immunocompromised since the virus itself is so prevalent universally that most have been previously infected. Disease from CMV most commonly affects patients with AIDS, especially when their CD4 cell count drops to less than 100/mm3. CMV also notoriously leads to disease in recipients of organ transplants.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20237.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The most common finding is the large, distal solitary esophageal ulcer in the symptomatic cases, which will present as odynophagia or constant substernal chest pain in AIDS and transplant patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20237.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;However, other studies have also cited ulcers to be multiple in the majority of patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20237.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;Dysphagia can occur as well.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20237.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, diarrhea.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20237.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Rare presentations include gastrointestinal bleeding and stricture formation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20237.r1">[1]</xref></p>

        <p>There are many noninvasive options for diagnosis; however, the most reliable modality is still endoscopy and biopsy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20237.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Because CMV can remain latent or be asymptomatic in immunocompetent hosts, the detection of CMV in tissue or body fluids does not equate to disease.&#x000a0;Serology in detecting levels of anti-CMV antibodies is not useful as disease correlates with defective cell-mediated immunity and not humoral immunity. Anti-CMV IgM indicates a recent infection, and anti-IgG can be present in most adults who have previously been infected. Blood and oropharyngeal viral culture, even if obtained from patients with risk factors such as organ transplant recipients, can help identify those at high risk for developing the disease but are not sensitive or specific for identifying active disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20237.r1">[1]</xref></p>

        <p>CMV can infect and remain latent in a large number of people, even if they are immunocompromised. Immunocompetent individuals will not typically manifest with symptomatic disease. Patients receiving chemotherapy, patients with advanced age, newborns, AIDS patients, and organ transplant patients are also at increased risk.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>CMV infection can be acquired through bodily fluids such as during the perinatal period, contact with contaminated blood products, and sexual contact.</p>
        <p>Patients should discuss their symptoms with the physician managing the cause of their immunocompromise, such as infectious disease specialists for AIDS patients, rheumatologists for autoimmune disease, and oncologists for patients on chemotherapy. Ultimately, patients should be seen by a gastroenterologist for upper endoscopy with biopsy. The biopsy samples will then be reviewed by pathologists to give the final diagnosis.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Antiviral drugs such as ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet are available to suppress viral replication. However, CMV can remain latent and thus recur in the future.</p>

        <p>The first step of improving the outcome for patients affected by CMV esophagitis is to recognize the at-risk population. Primary care physicians for patients with immunocompromised status should educate their patients about the potential diseases that they may face, including CMV esophagitis. The same should be done for patients soon to become immunocompromised, such as patients with newly diagnosed cancer, about to undergo chemotherapy, or patients who are about to begin immunosuppressive therapies for autoimmune disorders. Primary care physicians should educate patients regarding symptoms such as odynophagia, dysphagia, and chest pain. They should also emphasize the importance of HAART medication compliance for patients with HIV to avoid low CD4 count putting them at risk for CMV esophagitis. Patients should be educated about taking universal precautions when coming into contact with bodily fluids.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>If there is suspicion for CMV esophagitis, patients should be assessed by primary care physicians for a thorough history, physical and evaluate for the presence of risk factors. Patients should be referred to gastroenterologists for an upper endoscopy, with biopsy samples obtained and to be reviewed by pathologists. The results should be reviewed by the primary care physician with the patient. The primary care physician should also initiate induction treatment and follow-up with the patient. Infectious disease specialists should also be involved in the discussion if difficulties in treatment were to occur.</p>
