During the even-numbered years, when HPIV-1 is not circulating, HPIV-3 often has a longer spring season that extends into the fall or a second increase in activity from November to December of that year. Outbreaks of HPIV-2, which are smaller in magnitude,&#x000a0;occur biennially to alternate years with HPIV-1, or they can cause yearly outbreaks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26616.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26616.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26616.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;HPIV-4 is infrequently isolated with seasonality similar to that of HPIV-3.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26616.r7">[7]</xref></p>

        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>The pathogenesis of the parainfluenza virus consists of the host immune response and viral mechanisms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26616.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;The attachment and the fusion of the virus to the host cell are mediated by the virus surface proteins hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion glycoproteins (F) with the sialic acid residues on the surface of host epithelial cells respectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26616.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Transcription and maturation are mediated by the actin and the cytoskeleton, which also play a role in the movement of viral glycoproteins towards the surface of the host cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26616.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>The HN protein cleaves the sialic acid residue and facilitates the release of new virions from the host cell.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26616.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The fusion glycoproteins, as well as the HN proteins, are the most important targets for neutralizing antibodies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26616.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The inner surface of the virus envelope is covered by the matrix protein.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26616.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;A template for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, containing the P and L proteins, is generated by binding and coating the viral RNA with the&#x000a0;NP protein, to facilitate transcription, the P gene also encodes more nonessential viral replication proteins that vary among the four serotypes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26616.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;HPIV-2 RNA encodes a V protein, and HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 RNAs encode short C proteins, both of which decrease type 1 interferon activity of the host cell, which results in inhibiting the host immune response. The D protein is expressed by HPIV-3, but the relevance and function of it remain unclear. Replication occurs in the cytoplasm of the host cell, and the negative-sense RNA strands are then exported as a new virion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26616.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>The infection with parainfluenza virus first starts at the pseudostratified mucociliary airway epithelium of the nose and oropharynx, then spreading to the large and small airways.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26616.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;The attachment and the replication of the virus occur in the ciliated epithelial cells of the upper and lower respiratory tract, with peak replication 2 to 5 days after the initial infection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26616.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The extent of infection and the severity of the disease correlates with the location, that is, mild symptoms are associated with upper respiratory tract infection, and more severe ones, croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia occur with infection in the distal airways or lower respiratory tract.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26616.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>When the infection of epithelial cells of the small airways occurs, inflammatory infiltrates develop, and the host immune response is thought to contribute to disease pathogenesis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26616.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The first morphologic changes seen when a cell is infected with the HPIV, are the cytoplasm and nucleus increasing in size, focal rounding, and the host cell mitotic activity is decreased as soon as 24 hours after inoculation of the HPIV.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26616.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Basophilic or eosinophilic inclusions&#x000a0;can be found as well, as more changes, including single or multilocular cytoplasmic vacuoles and the formation of multinucleated giant cells, are noticed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26616.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;These giant cells are generally observed late in the infection, and they contain between two and seven nuclei.

        <p>HPIV usually causes a mild and rapidly repaired focal tissue destruction that may even be unnoticed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26616.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Giant-cell pneumonia can lead to death in immunocompromised hosts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26616.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Viremia and infection beyond the respiratory epithelium can also cause death, although they are rare and typically only found in immunocompromised patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26616.r8">[8]</xref></p>

        <p>The exacerbation&#x000a0;of chronic respiratory diseases caused by different viruses, including HPIVs, can be potentially prevented by early treatment with some of the antivirals. Although there is no effective antiviral treatment for HPIV in clinical practice, new strategies are being developed that may be practical and available for HPIV respiratory infections. The most direct approach consists of removing the sialic acid receptors, which are necessary for the attachment and fusion by the parainfluenza's HN and F proteins, thereby inhibiting the first step in infection. It is the DAS181, a recombinant sialidase protein, that has been proposed to inhibit HPIV infection effectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-26616.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;Peptide insertion into the cell membrane is also another therapeutic concept that can be used, which may allow the use of fusion-inhibitory peptides like peptides derived from the HR region, to inhibit the fusion of viruses to the host cells.

        <p>The management of the parainfluenza virus is best done with an interprofessional&#x000a0;team of healthcare professionals that includes a nurse, a primary clinician, an infectious disease expert, a pediatrician, an epidemiologist, a pharmacist, and in the more severe cases, the ICU team is also involved.

The primary clinician and the nurse are in the prime position to educate the patient and the family about the importance of prevention measures, including isolation and physical distancing.</p>
        <p>Management of an outbreak of the parainfluenza virus is interprofessional work, requiring the participation and the mobilization of not just the team within the hospital setting managing the patient but also local resources to contain the spread of the disease as early as possible.
