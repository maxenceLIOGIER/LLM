        <p>The rubella vaccine is a vaccine used to prevent rubella. Rubella, also known as German measles, is an acute, self-limiting, contagious viral infection seen most often in children and adolescents infected with the rubella virus. Rubella virus is a positive sense, single-stranded RNA virus acquired via inhalation of infectious large particle aerosols during close and prolonged contact with infected individuals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28670.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28670.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>The virus initially replicates in the nasopharyngeal cells and regional lymph nodes. Viremia occurs 5 to 7 days after inoculation, allowing the infection to spread throughout the body. Typical clinical presentation includes prodromal symptoms followed by a fine, maculopapular rash that erupts on the face and neck, spreading to the torso and limbs and lasting for about three days.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28670.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>Rubella can also spread via vertical transmission. Rubella infection in early pregnancy carries a significant risk for transplacental infection of the fetus, which may result in fetal loss or congenital malformation. Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is a variable constellation of congenital malformations caused by in utero infection early in pregnancy. Common manifestations of CRS include cataracts, deafness, congenital heart disease, and dermal erythropoiesis ("blueberry muffin" appearance).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28670.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28670.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>The rubella vaccine aims to prevent rubella. The vaccine is effective two weeks after a single dose and produces a seroconversion rate of about 95%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28670.r4">[4]</xref> In many places, including the United States, the rubella vaccine is only available as part of the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR), and the MMR combined with varicella (MMRV). Both formulations are live attenuated vaccines, meaning that the pathogen has been weakened in the laboratory to decrease its pathogenicity while maintaining its capability to replicate in the vaccinated individual to stimulate an immune response.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28670.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>The MMR or MMRV is given subcutaneously in 2 doses: one at 12&#x000a0;to 15 months and one at 4&#x000a0;to 6 years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28670.r5">[5]</xref> Before the introduction of the rubella vaccine, outbreaks of rubella occurred at variable intervals of 3 to 7 years, with the highest incidence among school children. Steep declines in rubella cases occurred with the routine immunization of young children, and countries with high rates of rubella immunizations no longer see cases of rubella or CRS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28670.r6">[6]</xref></p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-28670.s3" sec-type="Mechanism of Action">
        <title>Mechanism of Action</title>
        <p>The rubella vaccine contains live attenuated rubella virus. Live vaccines are whole-cell vaccines, meaning the entire virion is used to create the vaccine. An attenuated vaccine is a vaccine that reduces the virulence of the pathogen while still keeping it viable. This vaccine induces both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. It produces an IgG humoral immune response in individuals, as well as a cell-mediated immune response by rubella-specific activation of CD4+ T-helper and CD 8+ T-lymphocyte cells. Thus, the immune response to a live attenuated rubella vaccine is almost identical to one seen during a natural infection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28670.r4">[4]</xref></p>

        <p>In the United States, the rubella vaccine is available only in a combined preparation. Current vaccines include measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) without or with varicella (MMRV). Single antigen (i.e., monovalent) formulations of the rubella vaccine are not available in the United States but are available in some other countries.&#x000a0;</p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>Routine measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) immunization effectively prevents rubella infection, as indicated by the dramatic decline in the number of rubella cases following the introduction of vaccine programs in the 1960s.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28670.r6">[6]</xref> Vaccination with the MMR vaccine requires an interprofessional approach involving many healthcare team members, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), nurses, and pharmacists, as the proper administration of the vaccine changes according to the patient population and the clinical scenario. Vaccination of children should follow accepted rules and vaccination schedules. By engaging in collaborative efforts and openly sharing case information (particularly the patient's vaccination record), the interprofessional team can ensure proper scheduling of all vaccines, including MMR/MMRV, thereby optimizing patient outcomes and preventing unnecessary illness. [Level 5]</p>
        <p>One should remember that reactions to the vaccine often occur with the first rather than the second dose. Adverse effects include fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, joint complaints, hypersensitivity reactions, development of immune thrombocytopenia, and seizures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28670.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>Since the rubella vaccine is a live vaccine, it is not recommended in pregnant women, and women who receive the vaccine are advised not to become pregnant for four weeks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28670.r7">[7]</xref> It is also used with caution at the discretion of the healthcare provider in those with prior seizures or a family history of seizures or thrombocytopenia because the vaccine carries a small risk of febrile seizures and a small risk of thrombocytopenia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28670.r9">[9]</xref> Additionally, it is contraindicated in individuals with a severe allergy to gelatin or the antibiotic neomycin, both of which are vaccine ingredients.</p>
        <p>Formal documentation of immunity to rubella should be established for all women of childbearing age to decrease the incidence of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The recommendation is that all non-pregnant women who have no evidence of immunity should be offered a rubella vaccine. The MMR vaccine should not be administered during pregnancy due to concerns about teratogenicity. Instead, susceptible pregnant women should receive the MMR vaccine as soon as possible in the postpartum period.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28670.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>However, there are no reported cases of congenital rubella syndrome in women who have received the rubella vaccine during pregnancy. Rubella can cause CRS in the newborn. CRS is the most severe sequela of rubella and the main reason the rubella vaccine was developed. About 100,000 cases of CRS occur each year. The contraction of rubella within the first trimester carries a risk of miscarriage or stillborn birth. Fetuses that survive the infection can be born with severe heart disorders, blindness, deafness, or other life-threatening organ disorders.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28670.r2">[2]</xref> For these reasons, rubella is included in the TORCH complex of perinatal infections.</p>
        <p>Another recommendation is a multidisciplinary approach to address misinformation and the false perception of risk associated with vaccination. In 1998 a research paper published in <italic toggle="yes">The Lancet</italic>&#x000a0;authored by Dr. Andrew Wakefield claiming an association of MMR with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and inflammatory bowel disease(IBD).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28670.r10">[10]</xref> The claims from the paper were widely reported, leading to a sharp drop in vaccination rates in the UK and Ireland. Since the initial claim, multiple extensive epidemiological studies were undertaken that ruled out a relationship between vaccination (including the MMR) and the occurrence of ASD or IBD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28670.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Further investigations found that Wakefield had multiple undeclared conflicts of interest, had manipulated evidence, and had conducted research in a manner that was not in accordance with medical ethics. The Lancet paper was fully retracted in 2010. The scientific consensus today is that there is no association between the MMR vaccine and ASD, and the benefits of vaccination greatly outweigh its potential risks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-28670.r12">[12]</xref></p>
