        <p>
<bold>Definitions</bold>
</p>
        <p><bold>Medicare </bold>and<bold> Medicaid accreditation</bold> refers to the process of evaluation and recognition of healthcare providers, such as hospitals and clinics, by the CMS to ensure that they meet specific standards of care. Accreditation is voluntary, but it is required for facilities that wish to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155642.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Deemed status</bold> is a designation&#x000a0;granted to healthcare facilities accredited by an approved accrediting organization, such as The Joint Commission, that CMS has recognized as meeting the requirements for participation in Medicare and Medicaid. This means that the healthcare facilities with deemed status do not need to undergo a separate survey by CMS to become eligible for participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs, as the accrediting organization has already assessed the facility for adherence to CMS standards.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155642.r6">[6]</xref></p>
        <p>For facilities lacking accreditation or deemed status from CMS, a separate survey by CMS is mandatory to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs. This survey assesses the facility's adherence to CMS criteria, including patient care, safety, physical environment, administration, and more.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155642.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Significance</bold>
</p>
        <p>Accreditation and deemed status contribute to the assurance of high-quality care and adherence to industry standards within healthcare facilities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155642.r8">[8]</xref> Patients gain access to care in accredited facilities or those with deemed status, assuring that these facilities meet CMS requirements. Moreover, accreditation and deemed status can offer healthcare facilities a competitive edge by showcasing their dedication to quality care and safety, which both patients and insurers appreciate.</p>

        <p><bold>Collaboration of Healthcare Professionals in Medicare and Medicaid Accreditation.&#x000a0;</bold>The accreditation and deemed status process for Medicare and Medicaid programs require the cooperation of various healthcare professionals, including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other allied health professionals. The interprofessional team should work together to ensure compliance with the CMS standards and regulations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155642.r36">[36]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Critical Role of Nurses in the Accreditation and Deemed Status Process.&#x000a0;</bold>Nurses play a crucial role in the accreditation and deemed status process, as they are often responsible for implementing and maintaining the policies and procedures necessary for compliance. They can contribute to developing and revising policies and procedures to ensure that they are in accordance with CMS standards. Nurses can also facilitate communication between the healthcare team and patients to meet the patient's needs and concerns.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155642.r37">[37]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Contributions of Pharmacists in Medicare and Medicaid Accreditation.&#x000a0;</bold>Pharmacists can assist in the accreditation and deemed status process by reviewing medication-related policies and procedures, ensuring that they meet CMS standards, and monitoring the use of medications to promote patient safety. They can also educate other healthcare professionals on the proper use of medications and identify potential drug interactions or adverse effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155642.r38">[38]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155642.r39">[39]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Physician's Role in Ensuring Compliance With CMS Standards.&#x000a0;</bold>Physicians play a critical role in the accreditation and deemed status process by ensuring patient care is delivered according to CMS standards. They can contribute to developing clinical policies and procedures and monitor patient outcomes to ensure effective care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155642.r40">[40]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Effective Communication and Coordination in the Accreditation and Deemed Status Process.&#x000a0;</bold>Effective communication and coordination&#x000a0;among healthcare professionals are crucial to ensure the accreditation and deemed status process is successful.

        <title>Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Monitoring</title>
        <p><bold>Importance of Accreditation and Deemed Status for Medicare and Medicaid Programs.</bold>&#x000a0;Research has shown that effective nursing and interprofessional team monitoring can improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. For example, a systematic literature review found that interprofessional team-based care can improve patient satisfaction, reduce hospital readmission, and decrease healthcare costs [Level 1 evidence].<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155642.r21">[21]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Role of Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Teams in Maintaining Accreditation and Deemed Status.</bold> Studies have found that effective nursing monitoring can improve patient safety and quality of care. For example, a study of nursing monitoring in a long-term care facility found that increased monitoring led to decreased falls and medication errors [Level 2 evidence].<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155642.r42">[42]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Benefits of Effective Nursing and Interprofessional Team Monitoring in Improving Patient Outcomes</bold>. Similarly, effective allied health monitoring can improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. A study of allied health monitoring in a hospital setting found that increased monitoring led to decreased patient length of stay and readmission [Level 2 evidence].<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155642.r42">[42]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Importance of Allied Health Monitoring in Maintaining Accreditation and Deemed Status.</bold>&#x000a0;It is essential to understand the specific regulatory requirements to support further the importance of nursing, allied health, and interprofessional team monitoring in maintaining Medicare and Medicaid accreditation and deemed status. For example, the CMS requires nursing homes to have a registered nurse on duty at least&#x000a0;8 hours a day,&#x000a0;7 days a week, and a licensed nurse 24 hours a day. Additionally, nursing homes must conduct periodic assessments of each resident's functional capacity and develop a plan of care that includes measurable objectives and timetables [Level 3 evidence]<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155642.r43">[43]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Regulatory Requirements for Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Monitoring in Medicare and Medicaid Programs.&#x000a0;</bold>Similarly, CMS requires hospitals to have an effective quality assessment and performance improvement (QAPI) program that includes monitoring and tracking adverse events, patient outcomes, and compliance with regulatory requirements. This program should involve interprofessional teams, including nursing and allied health professionals, and should include a process for analyzing data and implementing improvement initiatives [Level of Evidence].<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155642.r44">[44]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155642.r45">[45]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155642.r21">[21]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>

<bold>Discussion</bold>
</p>
        <p>Medicare and Medicaid are&#x000a0;2 government-sponsored healthcare programs that provide coverage for certain groups of individuals. Accreditation and deemed status are essential for healthcare organizations that participate in these programs, as they indicate that the organization meets specific standards of care.&#x000a0;Nursing, allied health, and interprofessional team monitoring ensure that healthcare organizations maintain accreditation and deemed status. These teams work together to provide comprehensive and effective patient care while meeting regulatory requirements. Research has shown that effective monitoring can improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Regulatory requirements further emphasize the importance of these teams in providing high-quality care and meeting regulatory standards.</p>
