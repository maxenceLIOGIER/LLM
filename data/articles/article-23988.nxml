        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Labyrinthine fistula is an abnormal communication between the inner ear and the surrounding structures. Labyrinthine fistulas are formed most commonly between the inner ear (round window or oval window) at the fissula ante fenestrum and surrounding structures,&#x000a0;causing perilymph leakage. The first report of a non-surgical 'spontaneous perilymphatic fistula' was identified in four patients, in 1970 by Stroud and Calcettera.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Prior to this in 1962, after stapedectomy/stapes mobilization, the polyethylene strut would sometimes slip and enter the inner ear leading to perilymph accumulation in the inner ear, escaping through the strut. This was termed as "slipped strut problem." Symptoms associated with "slipped strut problem" were hearing fluctuations, aural fullness, vertigo, tinnitus, and imbalance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Labyrinthine fistula and perilymphatic fistula refer to the same defect and can be seen in the literature being used interchangeably.</p>

      <sec id="article-23988.s3" sec-type="Etiology">
        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>Labyrinthine fistulas can be a consequence of a congenital otologic disorder, acquired by physical injury or from an iatrogenic cause. The most common causes are head injuries&#x000a0;from trauma, labor, coughing, sneezing, pathologies that lead to increased intracranial pressure, blast injuries, diving, and flying barotrauma. Unique causes that have been reported included lightning strikes, airbag trauma, and acoustic trauma from the sirens of fire engines and other loud modalities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Sneezing specifically has been seen to cause an increase in the cerebrospinal fluid pressure leading to rupture of the round window membrane&#x000a0;resulting in such types of fistulas.</p>
        <p>Cholesteatomas caused by chronic otitis media are another cause of perilymphatic fistulas. The reported incidence of cholesteatoma-induced perilymphatic fistula varies from 4% to 15%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Cholesteatomas are known to&#x000a0;erode bone, leading to a number of complications, including fistulas. The lateral semicircular canal is most often involved. However, the other semicircular canals can be involved as well. Furthermore, although rare, complications involving the cochlea may be involved as well.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;Cochlear fistulas often have fistulas in other parts of the labyrinth.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r4">[4]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-23988.s4" sec-type="Epidemiology">
        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>Labyrinthine fistulas are rare, and the prevalence/incidence generally has not been well reported. The incidence of&#x000a0;cholesteatoma-induced fistulas from chronic otitis media has been reported to be between 4% to 15%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r3">[3]</xref></p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-23988.s5" sec-type="Pathophysiology">
        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>The exact mechanism and pathophysiology are not well defined. In animal models, it was associated with air bubbles that lead to profound sensorineural hearing loss by the disruptions of the propagation of the acoustic waves traveling in the basilar membrane.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The pneumolabyrinth itself may cause severe irritation leading to severe rotational vertigo. Because the labyrinth is connected to the cochlea, fistula formation can lead to sensorineural loss and vertigo. Additionally, those fistulas that arise with cholesteatoma can cause erosion of the endochondral bone that overlies the labyrinth leading to fistulas.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;Perilymphatic fistulas caused by physical exertion like weightlifting, coughing, or sneezing are thought to occur due to increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure that is then transferred to the labyrinth by the cochlear aqueduct or internal auditory canal.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r7">[7]</xref></p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-23988.s6" sec-type="History and Physical">
        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>A careful history and physical is necessary, as a labyrinthine fistula can easily be missed or misdiagnosed.&#x000a0;A labyrinthine fistula should be suspected in patients that sustain a temporal bone fracture or membranous labyrinthine rupture from head trauma, which includes implosive (Valsalva, blowing nose) and explosive (increased intracranial pressure from sneezing, coughing, weight lifting, and blast injuries). The primary symptoms of a traumatic labyrinthine fistula are sensorineural hearing loss and dizziness following the trauma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;Hearing loss is often sudden or progressive and can manifest days after a trauma. Dizziness often presents as disequilibrium, severe vertigo, or positional dizziness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>A labyrinthine fistula should also be suspected if a patient has vestibular disturbances and/or hearing loss after a stapedectomy. The artificial prosthesis can become dislodged, leading to perilymph leakage. Finally, a labyrinthine fistula should be suspected in those who have chronic otitis media. Cholesteatomas often form in these individuals,&#x000a0;which can lead to erosion of the petrous bone that surrounds the labyrinth causing a fistula. Barotrauma is a possible cause, such as from diving or flying.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Perilymphatic fistula should be suspected in those that complain of dizziness and sudden or progressive sensorineural hearing loss after barotrauma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Important exam findings include the positive fistula test, where air is insufflated in the ear, causing nystagmus. A cholesteatoma may also be seen with the otoscopic evaluation.</p>
        <p>Another important exam finding is Tullio&#x02019;s phenomenon, where dizziness occurs after introduction to sound. The patient may have a hearing loss that may be sensorineural, conductive, or a combination of the two.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Because of the variability of hearing loss, a&#x000a0;tuning fork may be of limited use.</p>
        <p>The Fukuda/Unterberger test determines postural instability from vestibular hypofunction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;A patient is asked to walk forward with their eyes closed and then abruptly turn with one foot and stop. The test is positive if the patient is unable to stabilize their balance after stopping. Generally, 64% of patients had a history of vertigo, 15% of patients were found to have profound sensorineural hearing loss, and 97% of patients had radiological findings suggestive of fistula.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r4">[4]</xref></p>

        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>Diagnosing labyrinthine fistulas can be difficult. Diagnostic criteria are not well established. There are criteria suggested by the Intractable Hearing Loss Research Committee of the Ministry of Health and Welfare (revised 2016).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;These include:</p>

        <p>A complete assessment of auditory acuity, including auditory brainstem response (ABR), emission testing, and pure tone audiometry should be done to assess hearing loss.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;A computed tomography (CT) scan is the most reliable method for the diagnosis of labyrinthine fistulas preoperatively. Pneumolabyrinth seen on a CT scan confirms the diagnosis and indicates the need for urgent surgical intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;However, when the pneumolabyrinth is small, visualization on CT can be challenging. Therefore, getting coronal views of the temporal bone to the superior semicircular canals would aid in the diagnosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Definitive diagnosis can only be achieved with exploratory tympanotomy (ET).</p>

      <sec id="article-23988.s8" sec-type="Treatment / Management">
        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>There is currently no consensus on optimal surgical management of labyrinthine fistulas.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Goto et al. came to the conclusion that urgent tympanotomy was not required due to poor results with hearing recovery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;Seltzer and Mccabe, however, found that hearing improvement was possible after many years of having symptoms in patients that had a perilymphatic repair.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;This suggests that early surgical intervention may be important for eventual hearing recovery. Corticosteroids given intravenously during surgery have been associated with the improvement of postoperative hearing. Obliteration of the mastoid also has been shown to improve postoperative dizziness in some patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>Because of a lack of definitive diagnostic criteria, conservative management is preferred initially with head elevation, bed rest, and avoiding activities that would increase intracranial pressure and straining. If symptoms persist or are recurrent, exploratory tympanotomy is the next step. Surgery has been shown to often improve dizziness and vertigo, but rarely improved hearing loss with increased risk of iatrogenic sensorineural hearing loss.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>Management of labyrinthine fistulas induced by cholesteatomas includes complete removal of the cholesteatoma matrix from the fistula and subsequent closure of the fistula.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23988.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Resurfacing of the horizontal semicircular canal is preferred to "plugging" as this leads to canal function loss with increased risk of hearing loss. Similar to other causes of perilymphatic fistulas, surgical treatment does seem to have better outcomes with vestibular symptoms rather than auditory symptoms.</p>

        <p>Surgical intervention has&#x000a0;been shown to&#x000a0;improve symptoms of vertigo and dizziness the most.

        <p>Superior canal dehiscence syndrome can also arise as a complication, which is believed to be a variant of the fistula, but not caused by a true fistula (rather a communication between the superior bony canal and middle cranial fossa), may cause some unique phenomena, such as hearing one&#x02019;s own voice, heartbeat, and eye movements. Pressure changes induced by performing a Valsalva maneuver with pinched nostrils (or otherwise straining) may provoke nystagmus and/or oscillopsia and vertigo.</p>

        <title>Deterrence and Patient Education</title>
        <p>Patients who are diagnosed with a labyrinthine fistula should avoid environments and exposures that instigate symptoms. These include movements like&#x000a0;straining and heavy lifting, increased pressure changes like air travel, popping ears, forceful blowing of the nose, scuba diving, and environments with loud noises. If it is necessary to be in one of these situations, the patient should be encouraged to seek the assistance of someone else to help if imbalance or dizziness occurs.

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>Labyrinthine fistulas are difficult to diagnose and are best managed by an interprofessional team approach. The most common presenting symptoms are hearing loss and vertigo, which can easily be misdiagnosed. It is important for the primary healthcare professional to get a detailed history and physical exam in order to properly differentiate a perilymph fistula from other similar diagnoses.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Otolaryngologists should be consulted on all suspected cases and be involved earlier in the disease process and assessment, especially when hearing loss is involved. If a neurotologist is available, they would be able to assess the candidacy of the patient for surgical intervention.&#x000a0;If symptoms present in the hospital, nurses can be vigilant on whether the patient has an altered gait or if the patient has difficulty hearing or understanding what is being said to them.&#x000a0;Although perilymph fistulas lead to increased mortality, prompt diagnoses of and proper treatment would improve morbidity and overall quality of life of the patient.</p>
