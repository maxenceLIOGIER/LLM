        <p>The Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 is a law enacted by the 91st United States Congress focused on reducing unintentional poisoning caused by medications and common household products. The law requires that prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, hazardous material, and other household products be packaged with child-resistance packaging. This activity reviews the Poison Prevention Packaging Act and highlights the purpose of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients who may require special packaging.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p content-type="pubmed-excerpt">The Poison Prevention Packaging Act (PPPA) was established in 1970 by President Richard Nixon. The law&#x02019;s primary goal is to ensure child safety by preventing accidental ingestion of harmful chemicals. The law states items such as prescription drugs, over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, household chemicals, and other hazardous products must utilize child-resistant packaging. The nature of this packaging would avert children of the age of five and younger from easy access and provide a protected container. This has proven to avoid inadvertent prescription poisonings. This law has impacted numerous parties, including children, the elderly, and persons with disabilities.</p>
        <p content-type="pubmed-excerpt">However, retrospective concerns have been drawn that the elderly and the disabled may struggle to open their medication due to the packaging style. As a result, several supplemental changes have been enacted that allow certain medications to exempt the restrictions under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act. These changes have been made in the best interest of the patient, patient&#x02019;s family, and national safety at the core of the discussion. As a direct result of the PPPA, children 5 years of age and under deaths decreased by 1.4 per million.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131549.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131549.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131549.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131549.r4">[4]</xref></p>

        <p>Relevant concerns about the Poison Prevention Packaging Act target the elderly or people with physical disabilities. This limited population must request special packaging if they desire a non-child-resistant container. The special packaging must abide by such guidelines:</p>
        <p>Each special package will still have to remain senior-adult and younger-adult resistant. When applicable, a metal aerosol container can be utilized if compliant with other states of federal regulations. There shall be no reusable special packaging. Containers with liquid will be restricted to two milliliters if the container is activated, inverted, or squeezed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131549.r6">[6]</xref></p>
        <p>A label must be provided on the container stating, &#x0201c;This Package for Households Without Young Children.&#x0201d; This statement is required for any special packaging according to the act. The label should appear easily legible on the borderline of the principal display panel. The statement must be written in contrast to the other labels. For smaller containers unable to accommodate the label, a substitute label will proceed with the statement as &#x0201c;Package Not Child-Resistant.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131549.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131549.r8">[8]</xref></p>

        <title>Clinical Significance</title>
        <p>The Poison Prevention Packaging Act has effectively reduced the number of deaths in children of the age of five and under. Before enacting the PPPA, unintentional deaths resulting from the consumption of pharmaceuticals and household products were among the leading causes of death in infants and young children. Once the Poison Prevention Packaging Act was successfully put into place in 1940, the accidental deaths related to unintentional poisoning in children 5 and under fell by a rate of 1.4 per million. The reduction in mortality rate among this population has been projected to be between 40-45 percent as a direct effect of the Poison Prevention Packaging Act.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131549.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131549.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131549.r10">[10]</xref></p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>The Poison Prevention Packaging Act has critically impacted the procedures of providing prescriptions over the last century. This Act allows pharmacists the opportunity to discuss the proper handling of the storage of pharmaceuticals in the consumers' homes. By discussing these topics with the consumers, pharmacists will continue to protect children from potential hazards.</p>
        <p>Simultaneously, efforts to properly provide for elders and persons with disabilities remain to provide a high-quality standard of care. The pharmacist must dispense oral prescription drugs in special packaging unless the drug is exempted or the patient or prescribing practitioner requests nonspecial packaging.&#x000a0;However, in nursing homes, the staff is not required to give medication in a child-resistant container since nursing homes are an institution and are therefore exempt from the law.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131549.r1">[1]</xref></p>

        <title>Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Monitoring</title>
        <p>When a prescriber provides a written request for special packaging, the pharmacist's role is not only to fulfill the request but also to act as a knowledgeable resource for the patient.&#x000a0;It is advisable for the dispensing pharmacist to periodically verify with all patients who have blanket waiver requests for non-special packaging to ensure that noncomplying packaging is the preferred packaging choice for the patients' prescription drugs.&#x000a0;In case of suspected poisoning or childhood ingestion emergency, if a health care provider cannot provide the necessary emergency information for the caller or advise on the proper course of action, refer the caller to the Poison Control Center or nearest hospital emergency room. The National Poison Control Center phone number is 1-800-222-1222.</p>
        <p>While one of the largest responsibilities of the Poison Prevention Act remains is those who manufacture and package the pharmaceutical and household products that are deemed poisonous to children, physicians and pharmacists hold an equally critical role. Whether through providing feedback to pharmaceutical companies, modifying the packaging of specific pharmaceuticals, or even altering a therapeutic regimen, the final assessment remains at the discretion of the clinician and pharmacist. Both parties as a team must keep the patient's best interests at the forefront of this decision.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131549.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131549.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131549.r3">[3]</xref></p>
