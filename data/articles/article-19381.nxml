        <p>Emergency medical services (EMS) providers frequently encounter patients with chest injuries, which account for approximately 25% of all trauma-related deaths, second only to head and neck injuries.

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Emergency medical services (EMS) providers commonly encounter patients with chest injuries. Trauma to the thorax accounts for nearly one-fourth of all trauma-related mortality cases, second only to head and neck injuries. These injuries often require rapid intervention and stabilization, whether they are from penetrating (ie, gunshots, lacerations, punctures) or blunt (ie, motor vehicle accidents, falls, crush injury, blasts, burns) trauma. EMS aims to&#x000a0;reduce the duration&#x000a0;between injury and medical care. Specific&#x000a0;protocol varies slightly between different systems, but the overall approaches are similar and&#x000a0;are guided by the general principles of the advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocol.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19381.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19381.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>Given the breadth and potential severity of chest trauma sequelae, rapid transport to a receiving hospital is critical. Immediate interventions are occasionally necessary, but EMS providers should prioritize minimizing time in the field.&#x000a0;Studies suggest that superior patient outcomes are associated with invasive procedures performed in-hospital rather than during prehospital intervals.</p>
        <p>Prehospital management in the United States consists of essential or basic life support and ATLS. Primary interventions include noninvasive airway management, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation, hemorrhage control, spine immobilization, and splinting/stabilization of extremity fractures. Advanced techniques include advanced airway interventions (including endotracheal intubation), administration of select medications, cardiac monitoring, and needle decompression. The availability of transport services and the capabilities of destination hospitals vary significantly throughout different geographic settings, necessitating adjustments based on local resources and facilities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19381.r3">[3]</xref></p>

        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>Mechanisms of traumatic chest injuries can be classified as penetrating (eg, gunshots, lacerations, and punctures) or blunt (eg, motor vehicle accidents, falls, crush injuries, blasts, and burns). The majority of chest trauma cases are associated with blunt injuries. Both types of trauma can result in various sequelae, including tension pneumothorax, open pneumothorax, hemothorax, flail chest, pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, aortic rupture, esophageal rupture, tracheal or bronchial tree rupture, myocardial or pulmonary contusion, and diaphragmatic rupture.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19381.r4">[4]</xref></p>

        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>Most pathological effects result from disrupted respiratory and hemodynamic functions. A flail chest occurs when 3 or more contiguous ribs are each broken in at least 2 places, creating a "free-floating" segment of the chest wall. Pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium may also occur during chest trauma.</p>
        <p>Examples of complex chest trauma occur via the following mechanisms:&#x000a0;</p>

        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>EMS providers may receive inaccurate or incomplete information from dispatch before the patient arrives at the emergency department. Many factors, including the patient's condition and scene safety, determine how much time can be spent gathering information in the field. Ideally, EMS personnel should obtain an abbreviated summary of the inciting event, the overall timeline, and the patient's medical history while performing a brief physical examination.</p>
        <p>If a patient is incapacitated, family members or other witnesses may be able to provide relevant information. Details such as the amount of blood loss (eg, from gunshots, stabbings, and amputations), extraction times (eg, from motor vehicle accidents and structural collapses), and any changes in mental status or vital signs during transport should be communicated to hospital providers upon arrival.</p>
        <p>A detailed history and physical examination performed by in-hospital providers are essential for determining appropriate treatment or the need for further transport. The physical examination is arguably more important than the history, especially in cases where the patient cannot communicate with the providers.&#x000a0;</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-19381.s7" sec-type="Evaluation">
        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>When caring for a trauma patient, EMS providers have&#x000a0;3 critical tasks&#x02014;physical examination and recognition of injuries, stabilization, and transportation to a nearby trauma center or hospital. The primary survey follows the "ABC" assessment&#x02014;airway, breathing, and circulation. These critical categories&#x000a0;must be&#x000a0;resolved before progressing to the secondary survey,&#x000a0;even if the patient has an apparent or distracting traumatic injury. The patient's vital signs and level of consciousness must also be assessed regularly. Prehospital care providers should&#x000a0;focus on&#x000a0;severe hemorrhage control, airway maintenance, and recognition of life-threatening conditions.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Airway</bold>
</p>
        <p>Assessment and stabilization of the airway&#x000a0;is the initial step of providing care to&#x000a0;trauma patients. A preliminary impression can be ascertained from the patient's appearance and verbalization. An altered mental status or injury to the head or neck can complicate this step. Cervical spine precautions are vital, and there should be a low threshold for immobilization and cervical collar placement. Necessary airway interventions include jaw thrust maneuvers, oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airways, suctioning, and supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula or non-rebreather facemasks. Further airway control may&#x000a0;be temporizing (eg, supraglottic airway) or definitive (eg, endotracheal intubation).</p>
        <p>
<bold>Breathing</bold>
</p>
        <p>The patient's respiratory status is assessed immediately after, and often simultaneously with, the airway. Evaluation of the respiratory rate, chest wall movements, breath sounds, and oxygenation status aids in determining the need for immediate intervention. Providers should look for signs or symptoms of tension pneumothorax, open pneumothorax, and flail chest in particular.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Circulation</bold>
</p>
        <p>Assessment of circulatory status is particularly important&#x000a0;for patients with chest trauma, as hemodynamic compromise can be rapid and severe. The "C" of circulation includes evaluating distal pulses in all extremities.</p>
        <p>Cardiac monitoring, examination for signs of internal or external bleeding, and applying direct pressure or a tourniquet are critical actions that may be indicated. Intravenous (IV) or intraosseous (IO) access may be obtained en route for fluid bolus administration but should not delay transport. Similarly, cardiac monitoring and a 12-lead ECG may be helpful but should not delay timely delivery to the hospital.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19381.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Other Considerations</bold>
</p>
        <p>Several EMS considerations are associated&#x000a0;with the prehospital setting.&#x000a0;The first is assessing and establishing scene safety. EMS providers practice in diverse environments, ranging from cramped personal living quarters to widespread disaster areas. Each setting poses unique threats to both patient and EMS personnel safety. Although there is an innate inclination to help the victim, providers must recognize that their well-being is imperative to be able to help others. Precautions must be taken early to minimize the risk to providers during patient treatment. Additionally, environmental conditions can change rapidly, and periodic reassessment of scene safety is recommended when possible.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19381.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>In prehospital settings, the SAFE approach is recommended:&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19381.r6">[6]</xref></p>

          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>EMS providers also encounter&#x000a0;scenarios involving multiple injured individuals.&#x000a0;In these situations, EMS personnel&#x000a0;must rely on clinical assessment and&#x000a0;established system-specific triage criteria to distribute resources appropriately and&#x000a0;determine each patient's proper setting and order. Triage protocols vary between systems&#x000a0;and are continually being reviewed and revised.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The&#x000a0;typical clinical signs of severe chest injury may not be&#x000a0;apparent in the field. For example, paradoxical motion may not be&#x000a0;observed&#x000a0;in a patient with shallow breathing due to pain. Auscultation&#x000a0;during the prehospital&#x000a0;interval may be challenging due to surrounding noise and other distractions. Therefore, prehospital providers should maintain a high index of suspicion for underlying severe injuries.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Ultrasound Use in Prehospital Settings</bold>
</p>
        <p>The use of ultrasound devices for trauma patients in prehospital settings has been explored in Europe and parts of the United States, although it is not yet universal. The benefits of&#x000a0;ultrasound&#x000a0;include increased diagnostic accuracy and improved decision-making regarding triage, choice of transport modality, and receiving facility. For chest trauma specifically, ultrasound can facilitate quicker, more reliable diagnoses of pneumothorax, pericardial effusion, and other conditions. However, additional research is needed to determine whether prehospital use of ultrasound is associated with reduced morbidity and mortality in trauma patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19381.r7">[7]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-19381.s8" sec-type="Treatment / Management">
        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>Several potential complications can arise from chest trauma, some requiring immediate intervention. Any critical issues identified during the primary survey demand an immediate response before further assessment. Some pathologies are indications of a "load-and-go" approach,&#x000a0;focusing on rapid, noninvasive intervention and timely transport to a definitive healthcare facility. After stabilization, the primary objective of EMS is to transport the right patient to the right place at the right time. EMS personnel are a key component of trauma management due to the&#x000a0;time-dependent nature of the injuries incurred<italic toggle="yes">.</italic></p>
        <p>
<bold>Tension Pneumothorax</bold>
</p>
        <p>Tension pneumothorax is characterized by the progressive accumulation of air within the thoracic cavity, creating a&#x000a0;volume of air and positive pressure within the pleural space. This&#x000a0;volume&#x000a0;exerts&#x000a0;a progressively worsening mass effect on the mediastinal and intrathoracic structures. Creating a one-way valve allows air to enter the thoracic cavity but restricts its exit. As air volume increases, local thoracic pressure rises, leading to the collapse of the ipsilateral lung and compression of the contralateral lung. The mediastinum shifts away from the trapped air volume,&#x000a0;reducing venous return to the heart. If left untreated, even a small pneumothorax can advance to obstructive shock and, potentially, fatal outcomes.</p>
        <p>Signs and symptoms of tension pneumothorax include hypoxia, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, tracheal deviation away from the injured side, and diminished breath sounds, hyperresonance, hyperexpansion, and reduced chest wall movements on the injured side.</p>
        <p>EMS providers may perform needle decompression by inserting a 14-gauge needle, typically in the second intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line on the affected side, which&#x000a0;allows the buildup of air and pressure to escape the thorax safely. The success rate for this procedure varies; the cannula can become obstructed by tissue or become&#x000a0;lodged within the muscle. This approach can temporarily stabilize a deteriorating patient by providing a stop-gap measure while preparing for definitive management, such as placement of a pigtail catheter or chest tube thoracostomy, typically conducted in a hospital setting.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19381.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19381.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Open Pneumothorax</bold>
</p>
        <p>Open pneumothorax is an open, "sucking" chest wound that communicates with the pleural space and allows free air entry during inspiration but&#x000a0;significantly limits the air that can escape during expiration. An open pneumothorax presents similar to (and often precludes) a tension pneumothorax. Immediate intervention is necessary to prevent rapid progression and severe complications. Applying an occlusive dressing and a non-permeable cover sealed tightly on&#x000a0;3 out of&#x000a0;4 sides reduces air entry during inspiration and allows more air to escape during expiration. This temporary measure buys time until definitive hospital management can be performed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19381.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Flail Chest</bold>
</p>
        <p>A flail chest occurs when adjacent ribs have&#x000a0;2 or more fractures each, creating a detached section&#x000a0;of the rib cage. This segment depresses inward during inspiration (due to negative intrathoracic pressure) and is pushed outward during expiration (due to positive intrathoracic pressure). This&#x000a0;phenomenon is termed "paradoxical breathing," as it is the opposite of normal chest wall motion. Blunt forces&#x000a0;with the magnitude capable&#x000a0;of causing multiple rib fractures often also cause&#x000a0;pulmonary contusion. However, a bruised lung is typically&#x000a0;not clinically&#x000a0;apparent&#x000a0;and&#x000a0;may only be&#x000a0;detected&#x000a0;incidentally&#x000a0;during imaging. EMS providers can stabilize flail segments in the field by applying manual pressure during transport to prevent hypoventilation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19381.r11">[11]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Other Diagnoses</bold>
</p>
        <p>Other diagnoses associated with chest trauma span from benign to life-threatening emergencies. EMS protocols have not yet been developed&#x000a0;to address severe&#x000a0;conditions&#x000a0;such as pericardial tamponade, massive hemothorax, aortic rupture, diaphragmatic tear, and esophageal injury. Therefore, EMS providers focus on stabilizing the "ABCs" and adopting a "load-and-go" approach.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19381.r12">[12]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19381.r13">[13]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>

        <p>Chest injuries&#x000a0;are associated with&#x000a0;high morbidity and mortality rates, with prognosis significantly influenced by the severity of the chest injury, the extent of extrathoracic injuries, and preexisting medical conditions. The majority of patients with blunt traumatic aortic injuries die before reaching a hospital or stand-alone emergency facility. However, early assessment, stabilization, and effective technical intervention are associated with improved patient survival rates. Advanced age in patients correlates with worse outcomes.</p>

        <title>Complications</title>
        <p>Chest injuries can lead to&#x000a0;various complications involving multiple thoracic organs, often requiring radiographic imaging or operative exploration to diagnose and repair. Tension pneumothorax is a common&#x000a0;life-threatening complication of both blunt and penetrating chest injuries. Pulmonary complications following traumatic chest injury pose a significant burden. Paradoxical rib movement in patients with flail chest injuries makes breathing difficult and can&#x000a0;contribute to respiratory failure.</p>

        <p>Public education about preventative measures may help to reduce the incidence of chest injuries. Bystanders are essential as they can promptly initiate and maintain lifesaving interventions for trauma patients until EMS arrives.</p>

        <p>Prompt recognition of injuries is critical, and any interventions performed during the prehospital&#x000a0;interval should be based on clinical assessment. Patients with multiple injuries should prioritize assessment for potential life-threatening thoracic injuries, with immediate interventions performed as indicated. IV fluid administration should not delay transportation and can be initiated during transport. The classical sign of a flail chest is a paradoxical movement that may not be immediately apparent in the prehospital setting. Open chest wounds should be covered with nonocclusive dressings. Prompt stabilization and rapid transfer to a trauma center are essential for achieving better outcomes. Transport to the appropriate level trauma center should occur as safely and quickly as possible.</p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>EMS providers are usually the initial responders to emergencies outside of hospitals and are responsible for assessing and treating patients. Their initial impressions often significantly influence receiving physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers at the hospital. A&#x000a0;smooth transition of care minimizes delays and promotes positive outcomes. Physicians, nurses, and EMS officials&#x000a0;collaborate to design and optimize protocols, effectively utilizing resources and provider skills in the field.</p>
        <p>Blunt or penetrating chest injuries carry high morbidity and mortality rates, with potential complications ranging from benign to fatal. EMS providers are often the first trained medical professionals to encounter trauma patients on the scene. Early assessment and stabilization are critical&#x000a0;to the survival and prognosis of each patient's condition.</p>
