        <p>Medicare, Medicaid, and Military and VA Programs provide healthcare services to vulnerable populations in the United States.&#x000a0;Medicare is a federal program that provides health insurance to individuals 65 years or older&#x000a0;and younger individuals with disabilities. Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that provides healthcare services to low-income individuals and limited resources. Military and VA programs offer healthcare services to active-duty military personnel, veterans, and their families.</p>
        <p>The programs offered in Medicare, Medicaid, and the Military and at the VA serve different functions and aim to improve health outcomes for their beneficiaries.</p>
        <p><bold>Medicare</bold>: Medicare offers various programs to improve health outcomes for beneficiaries. The Medicare Advantage program allows beneficiaries to receive care through a private health plan rather than traditional Medicare. This program has been shown to improve health outcomes by reducing hospitalizations and emergency department visits. The effectiveness of this program is supported by level 1 evidence. The Chronic Care Management program is designed to improve the management of chronic conditions among beneficiaries. This program effectively improves patient outcomes, such as reducing hospitalizations and improving patient satisfaction. The effectiveness of this program is supported by level 2 evidence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155656.r6">[6]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Medicaid</bold>: Medicaid offers programs to improve access to care and manage chronic conditions among its beneficiaries. The Medicaid Health Home program enhances care coordination for beneficiaries with complex medical needs. This program has been shown to reduce hospitalizations and improve access to care. The effectiveness of this program is supported by level 3 evidence. The Medicaid Managed Long-Term Services and Supports program provides beneficiaries with long-term care services and supports in the community rather than in institutional settings. This program has been shown to improve access to care and increase patient satisfaction. The effectiveness of this program is supported by level 3 evidence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155656.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Military Health System</bold>: The Military Health System offers programs to improve access to care and support the health and well-being of military personnel and their families. The TRICARE Prime program provides beneficiaries access to care through a network of civilian providers. This program has been shown to improve health outcomes by reducing hospitalizations and improving patient satisfaction. The effectiveness of this program is supported by level 2 evidence.

      <sec id="article-155656.s3" sec-type="Issues of Concern">
        <title>Issues of Concern</title>
        <p>
<bold>The Role of Telehealth and Mobile Health Clinics in Addressing Access to Care in Underserved and Rural Areas</bold>
</p>
        <p>One issue of concern is access to care, particularly in underserved and rural areas. Several studies have found that patients in these areas may have difficulty accessing healthcare services, resulting in poorer health outcomes (Level of Evidence: 3). Programs such as telehealth and mobile health clinics have been implemented to address this issue (Level of Evidence: 2), but further research is needed to determine their effectiveness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155656.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Cost-Related Concerns and Effectiveness of Cost-Sharing Programs in Healthcare Services</bold>
</p>
        <p>Another issue is the cost of healthcare services. While these programs are designed to provide affordable healthcare to eligible individuals, the cost of healthcare services can still be a burden for some patients. Several studies have examined the effectiveness of cost-sharing programs, such as copayments and deductibles, on patient outcomes (Level of Evidence: 2). These programs have been found to have mixed results, with some studies indicating that they may lead to reduced healthcare utilization and poorer health outcomes, while others suggest that they may improve patient outcomes by encouraging more judicious use of healthcare services.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155656.r10">[10]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Effectiveness of Patient Safety Initiatives and Clinical Practice Guidelines in Improving Quality of Care in Healthcare Programs</bold>
</p>
        <p>Quality of care is also a concern in these programs. While the quality of care healthcare professionals provides is generally high, there are still medical errors, misdiagnoses, and suboptimal care. Several studies have examined the effectiveness of quality improvement programs, such as patient safety initiatives and clinical practice guidelines, on patient outcomes (Level of Evidence: 1). These programs have been found to improve patient outcomes by reducing medical errors and improving the quality of care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155656.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Effectiveness of Patient-Centered Care Programs on Patient Satisfaction</bold>
</p>
        <p>Finally, there is the issue of patient satisfaction with the care received. Several studies have examined the effectiveness of patient-centered care programs, which prioritize patient preferences and involve patients in their care (Level of Evidence: 1). These programs have improved patient satisfaction and health outcomes by enhancing communication between healthcare providers and patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155656.r12">[12]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Pros and Cons of Using Compounded Medications Under Tricare Coverage</bold>
</p>
        <p>Tricare is a healthcare program that provides coverage for active-duty military members, retirees, and their families. Compound pharmacies create customized medications for patients based on individual needs. Several studies have evaluated the relationship between Tricare and compounding pharmacies.</p>
        <p>One study published in the American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy in 2019 found that compounded medication use among Tricare beneficiaries had increased over time, particularly for pain management. The study also found that compounded medications were associated with higher healthcare costs and a higher risk of adverse effects compared to commercially available medications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155656.r13">[13]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Another study published in the Journal of Managed Care &#x00026; Specialty Pharmacy in 2018 evaluated the use of compounded medications among Tricare beneficiaries with chronic pain. The study found that while the use of compounded medications was associated with higher healthcare costs, it was also associated with lower rates of opioid use and lower rates of opioid-related adverse events.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155656.r14">[14]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>A third study published in the Journal of Pharmacy Practice in 2016 evaluated the use of compounded medications among Tricare beneficiaries with dermatological conditions. The study found that while compounded medications were commonly used for dermatological conditions, there was a lack of evidence supporting their effectiveness and safety.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155656.r15">[15]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>These studies highlight the need for careful consideration when using compounded medications among Tricare beneficiaries. While compounded medications may have potential benefits for some patients, they also come with higher costs and potential risks compared to commercially available medications. Healthcare practitioners must carefully evaluate the use of compounded drugs and consider the evidence supporting their effectiveness and safety.</p>

        <title>Clinical Significance</title>
        <p>
<bold>Varied Effectiveness of Medicare, Medicaid, and VA Programs Based on Level of Evidence and Intended Outcomes</bold>
</p>
        <p>The clinical significance of the programs offered in Medicare, Medicaid, and Military settings and at the VA&#x000a0;varies depending on the specific program and its intended outcomes. The effectiveness of each program varies and is often based on the level of evidence supporting its implementation.</p>
        <p>For example, programs like the Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program effectively reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes among individuals with prediabetes. This program is based on Level 1 evidence from large randomized clinical trials with clear-cut results.&#x000a0;Other programs, like the Medicaid Health Homes program, have been implemented to improve care coordination and management for individuals with chronic conditions. While there is limited Level 1 evidence supporting this program's effectiveness, some evidence from cohort and case-control studies suggests that it may lead to improved outcomes, including reduced hospitalizations and emergency department visits. Similarly, the VA's Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT) program has been implemented to improve care coordination and patient-centeredness among veterans. This program is supported by Level 2 evidence from small RCTs with unclear results, as well as cohort and case-control studies suggesting improved patient outcomes.</p>
        <p>Overall, understanding the clinical significance and effectiveness of the various programs offered in Medicare, Medicaid, and Military settings and at the VA requires a comprehensive understanding of the specific outcomes they aim to achieve, the level of evidence supporting their effectiveness, and any issues of concern that could impact their implementation and outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155656.r16">[16]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155656.r17">[17]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Nurse-led Care Coordination Interventions</bold>
</p>
        <p>Level 1-evidence studies have shown that nurse-led care coordination interventions can significantly improve patient outcomes, such as reduced hospitalizations and emergency department visits, for Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions. Patient-centered care programs, which prioritize patient preferences and involve patients in their care, have also improved patient satisfaction and health outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155656.r18">[18]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Interprofessional Education Programs</bold>
</p>
        <p>Level 2-evidence, interprofessional education programs have significantly improved communication and collaboration among healthcare team members, leading to improved patient outcomes. This is particularly important in delivering high-quality care in VA settings.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155656.r19">[19]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155656.r20">[20]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>interprofessional Team-Based Care Coordination</bold>
</p>
        <p>Level 3-evidence, interprofessional-team&#x02013;based care coordination effectively improves outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries with complex care needs. Effective communication and collaboration among healthcare providers have also been associated with improved patient outcomes, increased patient satisfaction, and improved healthcare provider satisfaction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155656.r18">[18]</xref></p>

<bold>Issues of Concern Impacting the Effectiveness of Programs in Medicare, Medicaid, and Military and VA Programs</bold>
</p>
        <p>Some programs offered in Medicare, Medicaid, and Military settings and at the VA may have issues of concern that could impact their clinical significance and effectiveness. For example, the VA's Choice Program, which provides veterans access to care outside of the VA system, has been criticized for its complex eligibility criteria and long wait times, which can delay access to care and potentially compromise patient outcomes. Similarly, the Medicaid program has faced challenges in ensuring access to care for individuals with low income or disabilities, particularly in states that have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. This can impact the effectiveness of programs aimed at improving outcomes for these populations, such as Medicaid Health Homes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155656.r17">[17]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155656.r21">[21]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Ranking the Effectiveness of Medicare, Medicaid and Military and VA Programs:&#x000a0;Considering Evidence and Context</bold>
</p>
        <p>In ranking the effectiveness of these programs, it is essential to consider the specific outcomes they aim to achieve and the level of evidence supporting their effectiveness. Programs with Level 1 evidence from large RCTs with clear-cut results, such as the Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program, may be considered more effective than programs with lower levels of evidence. However, it is essential to consider the context in which these programs are implemented and the individual patient needs and preferences they aim to address. Programs with lower levels of evidence, such as the Medicaid Health Homes program, may still be effective in improving outcomes in specific populations, particularly when implemented in a patient-centered and coordinated manner.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155656.r22">[22]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Other Considerations</bold>
</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p><bold>Cost:&#x000a0;</bold>One of the main issues of concern for Medicare and Medicaid is the rising cost of healthcare services. As the population ages, healthcare costs continue to increase; these programs struggle to keep up with the demand for services. There is reduced funding for these programs and a strain on the quality of care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-155656.r23">[23]</xref></p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p><bold>Quality:&#x000a0;</bold>Another issue of concern is the quality of healthcare services.
