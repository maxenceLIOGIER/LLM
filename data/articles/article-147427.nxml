        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Pyrethrin and pyrethroid compounds are ester insecticides derived from <italic toggle="yes">Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium,</italic> with robust safety profiles in humans compared to many agricultural products. Natural pyrethrins have been used as insecticides for centuries, particularly for lice and mosquito control. Allethrin was the first pyrethroid synthesized commercially (in 1953 in Japan) and&#x000a0;was used as a household insecticide.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147427.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>Pyrethroids offer several advantages over natural pyrethrins, which prompted their development.&#x000a0;Pyrethroids are less prone to supply fluctuations, as natural pyrethrins need to be extracted from plants that&#x000a0;may have poor harvests. Furthermore, pyrethroids are more resistant to degradation than natural pyrethrins, display greater potency, and can be produced cost-effectively on a large scale.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>More pyrethroid compounds were produced and widely adopted during the remainder of the 20th century for their insecticidal properties in agriculture, mosquito control, and general safety.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147427.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Today, pyrethroids represent roughly 30% of all insecticides used worldwide.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147427.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;These compounds are widely used for personal and commercial pest control. Permethrin is a topically&#x000a0;applied pyrethroid used for treating scabies and lice.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147427.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>Structurally, most pyrethroids are esters containing a cyclopropane carboxylic acid moiety and a cyclopentenolone alcohol moiety. Pyrethrins and pyrethroids were initially divided by the symptoms they caused during experiments in the 1970s, where&#x000a0;test rats were exposed orally and intravenously. The "T syndrome" was named after tremors in rats exposed to type I pyrethroids, and the "CS syndrome" was named after choreoathetosis and salivation in rats exposed to type II pyrethroids.</p>
        <p>Subsequent data published in the 1980s showed CS syndrome was almost exclusively produced by pyrethroids containing a cyano linkage at the central ester structure of the molecule; T syndrome was almost exclusively produced by pyrethroids&#x000a0;that did not contain a cyano linkage. Today, type I pyrethroids refer to chemicals without a cyano group, and type II pyrethroids are those with a cyano group.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147427.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Compared to the type I group, type II pyrethroids are generally more potent, environmentally persistent, and toxic to humans.</p>

      <sec id="article-147427.s2" sec-type="Etiology">
        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>Little published data exists about the most common mechanisms by which patients experience toxic exposure to pyrethroids in the United States. Intentional ingestion and inhalational and dermal exposure are the most likely routes of entry into the human body. Agricultural workers and individuals spraying large&#x000a0;volumes of insecticide are at risk for inhalation and dermal exposure. One-third of pyrethroid exposure cases reported to the Toxic Exposure Surveillance System (TESS) between 2000 and 2005 involved children&#x000a0;younger&#x000a0;than 6.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147427.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;Thus, accidental exposure likely comprises a&#x000a0;significant fraction&#x000a0;of exposures outside of occupational settings.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-147427.s3" sec-type="Epidemiology">
        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>Poison centers documented 121,748 pyrethrin and pyrethroid exposure cases between 2000 and 2005 across the United States. During the study period, cases of pyrethrin and pyrethroid exposures reported to the TESS increased from 13,759 in 2000 to 25,949 in 2005. Roughly 33% of exposures occurred in children&#x000a0;younger&#x000a0;than 6.&#x000a0;Intentional ingestions&#x000a0;comprised less than 3% of cases, and the mortality rate was less than 0.01%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147427.r6">[6]</xref></p>
        <p>The National Poison Data System (NPDS) reported 20,123 cases of pyrethrin and pyrethroid exposure in 2022. Roughly 21% of exposures involved&#x000a0;children younger than 6. Similar to prior data, 2.6% of exposures were cases of intentional self-harm. Approximately 17.3% of exposures were treated in a healthcare facility, with 0.2% of all cases resulting in severe toxicity.&#x000a0;Four of the 20,123 cases resulted in fatality, resulting in a case fatality rate of 0.02%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147427.r7">[7]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-147427.s4" sec-type="Pathophysiology">
        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>The primary mechanism of action of pyrethrin and pyrethroids is prolonged activation and opening of voltage-dependent sodium channels, resulting in a tail current and prolonged depolarization. Type II pyrethroids are more potent, causing a more prolonged depolarization.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147427.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Insect voltage-dependent sodium channels have a greater sensitivity to pyrethroids, and these compounds are approximately 2000 times more toxic to insects than humans. Type I pyrethroids have a negative temperature coefficient, indicating higher potency at temperatures lower than normal human temperature. In contrast, type II pyrethroids have a positive temperature coefficient, are more potent at higher temperatures, and are thus more likely to cause toxicity in humans.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147427.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147427.r10">[10]</xref></p>
        <p>Pyrethrins and pyrethroids also act as antagonists at &#x003b3; amino-butyric acid (GABA) chloride channels within the central and peripheral nervous system.&#x000a0;This affinity likely causes the salivation and choreoathetosis symptoms that led to the naming of the original CS syndrome caused by type II pyrethroids. This same antagonist effect at GABA chloride channels likely plays a role in the seizure activity observed after significant type II pyrethroid exposure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147427.r11">[11]</xref></p>
        <p>The clinical manifestations associated with these action mechanisms vary. Skin exposures may manifest with paresthesias and contact dermatitis. Eye exposures may result in excessive lacrimation.&#x000a0;Pyrethroid&#x000a0;ingestion is more likely to result in toxicity and may cause excessive salivation, nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, altered mental status, muscle fasciculation, seizure, respiratory distress, and pulmonary edema.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147427.r12">[12]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-147427.s5" sec-type="Toxicokinetics">
        <title>Toxicokinetics</title>
        <p>Pyrethrins and pyrethroids generally have higher bioavailability by ingestion than dermal exposure. Additives in insecticides containing these substances also affect absorption, particularly piperonyl butoxide, which enhances absorption in humans and insects. Results from a prior study showed that less than 2% of cypermethrin, a type II pyrethroid, is absorbed dermally, while 19% to 50% is absorbed when ingested. Piperonyl butoxide-containing formulas increased dermal absorption rate to around 8% and gastrointestinal tract absorption to greater than 70%. Pyrethroids are rapidly cleared hepatically, though piperonyl butoxide also slows this metabolism. Nontoxic metabolites are subsequently excreted in urine.</p>

      <sec id="article-147427.s6" sec-type="History and Physical">
        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>Several&#x000a0;aspects of the patient's history are paramount to proper treatment. Determining the route of exposure is critical, as&#x000a0;it may dictate subsequent evaluation and management&#x000a0;and the need for immediate skin decontamination. Common exposure routes include ingestion, inhalation, and dermal. The clinician should obtain as much information about the product to which the patient was exposed.</p>
        <p>Pyrethroid types I and II present with similar rates of nausea, vomiting, and tremor. However, type II pyrethroids are more likely to present with neurotoxic manifestations, such as paraesthesias, depressed mental status, and seizures.&#x000a0;Hypersalivation has been observed more frequently with type II than type I pyrethroids.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147427.r13">[13]</xref>&#x000a0;Additional compounds in pyrethroid products, such as piperonyl butoxide or hydrocarbon carriers, may increase the duration of symptoms or cause toxicity on their own.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147427.r14">[14]</xref> Symptoms generally appear within minutes to hours of exposure, with local signs of irritation, such as dermatitis and abdominal pain, manifesting before systemic problems like altered mental status and seizures.</p>
        <p>Pertinent examination findings,&#x000a0;such as confusion&#x000a0;and depressed mental status,&#x000a0;may be seen in systemic toxicity.&#x000a0;However, these signs are rare except in large ingestions. Muscle fasciculations may also be seen in the extremities. Crackles or rales may be heard on auscultation secondary to aspiration, typically of the hydrocarbon carrier. Patients may have abdominal pain and tenderness following ingestion. Local irritation and erythema&#x000a0;arise from contact dermatitis. Patients experiencing an allergic response to pyrethroids&#x000a0;may display respiratory distress, urticaria, hypotension, and oral swelling. Lacrimation and salivation&#x000a0;may be expected in patients with ocular and oral exposures, respectively.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-147427.s7" sec-type="Evaluation">
        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>No single laboratory test exists to identify specific pyrethroid compounds.&#x000a0;However,&#x000a0;mass spectrometry&#x000a0;may be utilized in some settings to detect metabolites.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147427.r15">[15]</xref>&#x000a0;Given the overlap of symptoms with organophosphate toxicity, cholinesterase measurement may be helpful to delineate the type of exposure further. However,&#x000a0;such tests are&#x000a0;not rapidly available and lack the ideal sensitivity and specificity. Thus, cholinesterase measurement should not delay treatment.</p>
        <p>A&#x000a0;basic metabolic panel&#x000a0;helps evaluate for electrolyte abnormalities in patients with significant vomiting. Chest radiography should be obtained if patients&#x000a0;develop respiratory distress or have evidence of pulmonary edema on examination. Chemical pneumonitis or pulmonary edema secondary to aspiration may be delayed several hours.

      <sec id="article-147427.s8" sec-type="Treatment / Management">
        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>The management&#x000a0;of toxic exposure to pyrethroids&#x000a0;or pyrethrins includes&#x000a0;close monitoring, observation, and supportive care.&#x000a0;Patients&#x000a0;often fail to identify the insecticide product. Thus, other agents should be included in the evaluation, most&#x000a0;critically organophosphates, which have overlapping signs and symptoms such as salivation, lacrimation, mental status changes, and tremors but are typically of more serious health consequences. Prior studies have identified pyrethroid toxicity cases initially misdiagnosed as organophosphate toxicity and treated with atropine, resulting in significant atropine toxicity and death.</p>
        <p>Decontamination should be included among the first management measures in any pesticide exposure to prevent further toxicity to the patient and secondary contamination of healthcare workers.&#x000a0;Individuals&#x000a0;displaying evidence of anaphylaxis should receive epinephrine, antihistamine, and corticosteroids in line with usual anaphylaxis treatment.&#x000a0;Prior case reports also highlight that hydrocarbon carriers in pyrethroid insecticide formulations can cause chemical pneumonitis, potentially leading to respiratory failure and death after ingestion. Patients in respiratory distress should receive supplemental oxygen and be closely monitored. Local irritation from contact exposure should be cleaned with soap and water. Paresthesias have been treated with topical vitamin E oil, though this symptom is generally self-limited and resolves within 24 hours.</p>
        <p>Patients who develop seizures should be treated with benzodiazepines.&#x000a0;Individuals requiring endotracheal intubation should receive benzodiazepines or other GABA-receptor agonists for sedation.&#x000a0;Continuous electroencephalography&#x000a0;must be considered if anticipating persistent seizures. Further, benzodiazepines may also be used to treat patients who present with tremors after pyrethroid exposure. Noting&#x000a0;the time since ingestion is critical in possible pyrethroid poisoning cases. Activated charcoal&#x000a0;may be considered if the patient presents within an hour of ingestion. However,&#x000a0;this measure&#x000a0;is contraindicated if the patient is vomiting or&#x000a0;exhibiting mental status changes, increasing the&#x000a0;risk of charcoal aspiration. Gastric lavage and bowel irrigation are not recommended. Atropine&#x000a0;may be considered for excessive salivation or pulmonary edema but should be used cautiously, given its adverse effect profile.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-147427.r16">[16]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-147427.s9" sec-type="Differential Diagnosis">
        <title>Differential Diagnosis</title>
        <p>Organophosphate toxicity may present with symptoms similar to those of pyrethrin and pyrethroid toxicity and should be considered in severe poisoning cases. Peripheral neuropathies should be considered when patients present with paresthesias in the absence of other toxic manifestations of exposure. Patients with altered mental status and seizures should have additional neurologic and medical assessment for other causes of their presentation, such as stroke, metabolic encephalopathy, infection, or other toxic exposures. Patients with evidence of&#x000a0;chemical pneumonitis may have been exposed to any number of products, particularly hydrocarbons, which pose the greatest aspiration risk.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-147427.s10" sec-type="Prognosis">
        <title>Prognosis</title>
        <p>Patients poisoned by pyrethrins or pyrethroids have a favorable prognosis, as symptoms are generally mild and resolve with supportive care.&#x000a0;Individuals with localized&#x000a0;skin irritation can expect their symptoms to resolve spontaneously, typically within 24 hours. Patients with larger ingestions are more likely to develop systemic toxicity symptoms, potentially requiring hospitalization. Fatality is exceedingly rare and often associated with other toxic concomitant ingestions.</p>

        <p>Most patients with pyrethrin or pyrethroid poisoning present with minor, self-limited symptoms. Altered mental status, seizure, and pulmonary edema have been reported in the literature, largely associated with large ingestions. A broad differential must be considered in a patient presenting with&#x000a0;neurologic symptoms, especially if suspecting a concomitant ingestion.</p>
        <p>Organophosphate insecticides have been mostly phased out of residential use in the United States.&#x000a0;However, toxicity with these products&#x000a0;should still be strongly considered as a possible diagnosis in occupational agricultural exposures, especially since concomitant ingestion with organophosphate slows the metabolism of pyrethroid insecticides. Pyrethroid insecticides are manufactured with hydrocarbon carriers.&#x000a0;Patients with even small ingestions should be monitored for signs of aspiration, pneumonitis, or other lung injuries,&#x000a0;as&#x000a0;hydrocarbon carriers are of low viscosity and high volatility, increasing the likelihood of aspiration upon ingestion.</p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>Collateral history from the employer, parent, or anyone who witnessed the patient develop symptoms in the field helps establish&#x000a0;a rapid differential diagnosis. Identifying the compound and its active ingredients can help narrow the differential diagnosis in occupational exposure cases, such as in agricultural settings. Material safety data sheets&#x000a0;may be helpful references.</p>
        <p>Patients are rarely able to tell providers exactly what chemicals&#x000a0;they have been exposed to immediately upon arrival. Thus, the physical examination remains the mainstay of early diagnosis. Treatment should not be delayed while awaiting precise identification of the toxic substance. Poison control should be contacted early to guide&#x000a0;evaluation and management. Medical toxicologists should also be consulted to assist with patient management if available.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Pyrethroid poisoning can mimic organophosphate toxicity.&#x000a0;Proper personal protective equipment use and decontamination&#x000a0;help prevent further toxicity to the patient and secondary contamination of healthcare workers. Early communication with clinicians about contamination risks ensures safe care delivery for the healthcare team.&#x000a0;Severe toxicity&#x000a0;cases require management by a team of emergency clinicians, nurses, medical toxicologists, neurologists, and critical care clinicians. Patients with suspected intentional ingestion may benefit from the early involvement of psychiatrists. In contrast, individuals who have been accidentally exposed should receive&#x000a0;appropriate precautions to prevent recurrence. Early and continuous interprofessional coordination is essential for achieving the best outcomes in pyrethrin and pyrethroid toxicity cases.</p>
