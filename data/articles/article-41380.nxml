        <p>Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective in preventing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and is an essential tool for decreasing HIV transmission in high-risk populations. However, PrEP is underutilized as a preventive measure due to multiple barriers faced by individuals with a high risk of acquiring HIV.</p>
        <p>This activity provides clinicians with vital knowledge to tackle the ongoing global challenge of HIV prevention. Exploring the rationale, treatment options, and adherence strategies for PrEP empowers participants with the insights needed to address the unique needs of diverse populations and deliver optimal care to individuals at significant risk of HIV infection. Clinicians learn strategies for effective care coordination and communication among team members, ensuring an approach beyond medication prescription. Empowering clinicians involves integrating quality improvement and public health perspectives, emphasizing the significance of local epidemiology and the social contexts influencing HIV transmission. This approach enables the development of tailored services, programs, and policies that effectively address the population's needs.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>While&#x000a0;human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is not curable, it is preventable. Yet worldwide, about 1.3 million people acquired HIV in 2022, approximately 130,000 of whom were children.[WHO.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-hiv-hepatitis-and-stis-programmes/hiv/strategic-information/hiv-data-and-statistics">HIV Data and Statistics.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2023] In the United States, the number of people newly diagnosed with HIV amounted to more than 36,000 people in 2021, the most recent year for which data is currently available.[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/statistics.html">Basic Statistics.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2023] Transmission occurs most commonly&#x000a0;via heterosexual contact in Africa, while in most other regions of the world, it&#x000a0;occurs predominantly in those with male-to-male sexual contact. Rates of acquisition are often highest in people who inject drugs (PWID) or transgender people. The rates of HIV acquisition are decreasing worldwide due mainly to reduced transmission in Africa. However, some areas are experiencing increasing incident rates, notably Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Eastern Mediterranean, North Africa, and Latin America.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>Preexposure prophylaxis of HIV (PrEP) is an essential component of the recommended package for HIV prevention, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) involves the intake of antiretroviral medications either continuously or for identified high-risk events and is highly effective in preventing HIV. Compared to placebo, consistent use of daily&#x000a0;oral PrEP reduces the risk of sexual transmission of HIV by up to 92%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;PrEP with bimonthly injectable cabotegravir lowers the chance of sexual transmission of HIV by about 70% compared to those taking tenofovir&#x000a0;disiproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r6">[6]</xref>[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-guidelines-2021.pdf">PrEP Guidelines.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2021]&#x000a0;Though one trial of PWID observed individuals 40 years or older, those who used methamphetamines, and those with recent incarcerations had lower adherence than those without these risk factors, other studies have indicated the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of PrEP in preventing HIV in this population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <p>In 2015, the WHO first recommended PrEP to anyone who&#x000a0;was at substantial risk for HIV infection as part of&#x000a0;combination HIV prevention programs.&#x000a0;Populations that may benefit from preexposure chemoprophylaxis are those with an HIV incidence rate of about 3 per 100 person-years or higher.[WHO. <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240031593">Consolidated HIV Guidelines.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2021]&#x000a0;The addition of PrEP to locally available prevention measures is necessary to end global transmission of HIV, particularly in areas with a high burden of HIV.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;However, PrEP remains underutilized. In 2022, more than 2.5 million people worldwide received PrEP at least once, far short of the 10 million person target, but a considerable advance from&#x000a0;2019 when only 233,00 people were estimated to have received PrEP.[UNAIDS. <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://thepath.unaids.org/wp-content/themes/unaids2023/assets/files/2023_report.pdf">Global Report.</ext-link> 2023]</p>
        <p>HIV can infect individuals of any age, gender, race, or social class, and anyone who is sexually active or shares illicit drug equipment should be advised of the availability of PrEP. However,&#x000a0;certain groups are at higher risk and are a global priority for the implementation of PrEP services: gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM); transgender individuals; people who trade sex for money, goods, or services; and people who share injection drug needles, syringes or other equipment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r21">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r21">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r10">[10]</xref>[UNAIDS.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://thepath.unaids.org/wp-content/themes/unaids2023/assets/files/2023_report.pdf">Global Report.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2023]</p>
        <p>Whenever possible, PrEP should be started on the same day the client seeking PrEP or identified via screening to be at high risk for HIV acquisition presents to healthcare services after exclusion of active HIV and baseline creatinine testing.[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-guidelines-2021.pdf">PrEP&#x000a0;Guidelines.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2021][WHO.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240031593">Consolidated HIV Guidelines.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2021] Treatment with PrEP requires an ongoing commitment to connection with healthcare as part of a combination package that includes support, risk factor reduction, and counseling to improve treatment adherence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r11">[11]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;Individuals who regularly miss doses of their medication are at high risk for acquiring HIV.</p>
        <p>However, barriers to&#x000a0;PrEP treatment exist. In many countries, the availability of PrEP is limited or nonexistent despite increases in available therapeutic options.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r13">[13]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r14">[14]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r15">[15]</xref>&#x000a0;Even&#x000a0;in countries with PrEP programs, availability&#x000a0;remains&#x000a0;limited for many in the highest-risk groups.&#x000a0;Understanding local epidemiology, social context, and implementation science aids in developing policies, programs, and services that best serve the local population.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>PrEP for&#x000a0;HIV&#x000a0;is an essential part of clinical HIV prevention and health maintenance. The rationale for PrEP, epidemiology of&#x000a0;HIV transmission in high-risk populations, the identification of those at risk, treatment options, monitoring of PrEP, management of complications, client support for adherence to therapy, and individual, programmatic, and systems methods to enhance healthcare team outcomes in&#x000a0;providing PrEP to clients are integral to HIV prevention. Using quality improvement and public health lenses ensures maximal benefit to those most at risk.&#x000a0;</p>

        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>HIV is a retrovirus that replicates primarily in CD4+ T cells and macrophages, resulting in an illness characterized by an acute phase, followed by a prolonged, generally asymptomatic infection, and then leads to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome with progressive destruction of the immune system as CD4+ cells are depleted.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r16">[16]</xref>&#x000a0;The HIV viral load is exceptionally high during the acute phase of illness but rapidly decreases at the start of the latent period and then increases as the disease progresses. Due to the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy, HIV infection is now widely seen as a manageable chronic disease. However, despite significant advancements in controlling the virus, the disease remains a significant global health concern fed by and contributing to inequities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r17">[17]</xref>&#x000a0;Prevention measures, including PrEP, are critical to decreasing the burden on patients, communities, and healthcare systems.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The WHO and public health authorities in many countries recommend PrEP for anyone at high risk of acquiring HIV.[UNAIDS.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://thepath.unaids.org/wp-content/themes/unaids2023/assets/files/2023_report.pdf">Global Report.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2023] PrEP's key role in the prevention of HIV is based on several factors, including the long-term consequences of HIV infection despite the availability of excellent treatments, the limitations of the other approaches in preventing HIV, and the effectiveness and efficacy of PrEP.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The WHO estimates that more than 630,000 people died from HIV-related causes in 2022.[WHO.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-hiv-hepatitis-and-stis-programmes/hiv/strategic-information/hiv-data-and-statistics">HIV Data and Statistics.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2023] Thirty-nine million people are living with HIV, two-thirds of whom are in Africa. The CDC estimates that 1.2 million people in the United States had HIV at the end of 2021.[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/statistics.html">Basic Statistics.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2023] Long-term survival is possible with appropriate treatment but can come at a very high cost to the patient and healthcare system, particularly in resource-limited settings.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="36007138">[18]</ext-link>&#x000a0;Those who survive, dependent on CD4+ count, may be at risk for new opportunistic or reactivated infections associated with high morbidity.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="30020717">[19]</ext-link>&#x000a0;The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy can be associated with numerous adverse effects, drug interactions, and viral resistance to therapy. Many patients treated with protease inhibitors developed lipodystrophy and an increased risk for premature atherosclerosis.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="10860898">[20]</ext-link><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="11273212">[21]</ext-link>&#x000a0;Older, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) such as efavirenz are associated with neuropsychiatric and neurological manifestations.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="26203180">[22]</ext-link>&#x000a0;Newer generation antiretroviral classes such as integrase inhibitors or tenofovir alafenamide have far fewer adverse events reported than previous agents and are generally well tolerated&#x02014;but may be associated with metabolic effects such as weight gain.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="37433218">[23]</ext-link></p>
        <p>Diversity of HIV prevention options is necessary to ensure suitable choices are available to all those at high risk of HIV transmission. Treatment as prevention is very effective worldwide in both resource-rich and resource-limited settings, with 0% of sexual transmission of HIV to sexual partners if antiretroviral therapy is taken consistently and the viral load is undetectable.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="34510009">[24]</ext-link><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="32124189">[25]</ext-link>&#x000a0;However, not everyone is aware they have HIV, can take HIV medications consistently, or even if they do, can achieve complete viral suppression.</p>
        <p>Other measures, such as behavioral approaches, lower the risk of HIV. However, people have limits in their capacity to comply; no measures eliminate the risk.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="32124189">[25]</ext-link><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="32041979">[26]</ext-link>&#x000a0;Condoms are modestly effective in preventing HIV, other sexually transmitted infections, and pregnancy. A meta-analysis showed condoms reduce HIV transmission by more than 70% when used consistently by HIV-serodiscordant heterosexual couples.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="26488070">[27]</ext-link>&#x000a0;However, many lack the ability to ensure consistent use, particularly women and girls.[WHO. <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240031593">Consolidated HIV Guidelines.</ext-link> 2021] A lack of knowledge of individual risk levels also decreases PrEP uptake, particularly among women and youths. Female condoms have the advantage of transferring decision-making to the female, yet the method lacks widespread acceptance and understanding.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="30326709">[28]</ext-link><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="32567987">[29]</ext-link><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="32567987">[43]</ext-link></p>
        <p>The advent of PrEP puts control into the hands of individuals who are unable or unwilling to prevent exposure to HIV through other methods and adds an extra layer of protection if other methods are already used; this is particularly important when vaccine development has experienced setbacks, with several candidate vaccines failing in phase 3 trials.

        <p>The use of antiretrovirals as PrEP is a less expensive, more straightforward, and more effective way to prevent HIV in higher-risk populations compared to treatment with antiretroviral therapy.

        <p>When targeted at individuals with risk factors for HIV acquisition at the partnership level, the use of PrEP as prescribed has a powerful influence on reducing incident HIV transmission at the population level. A 2022 mathematical modeling study estimates that 33% of HIV infections can be prevented in people&#x000a0;aged 15&#x000a0;to 34, with 6% to 17% PrEP coverage if individual-level partnership dynamics are used to determine eligibility for PrEP.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="36385504">[37]</ext-link>&#x000a0;If eligibility is determined based solely on risk groups, 46% PrEP coverage would be required to achieve the same reduction in HIV infections.</p>

Further, antiretroviral therapy consists of multiple, generally expensive drug combinations versus simpler and less costly options available for PrEP. The WHO defined being at "substantial risk" as anyone with greater than a 3 per 100 person-years risk of acquiring HIV in the absence of PrEP, the level above which PrEP was found to be cost-saving.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="24629217">[41]</ext-link>&#x000a0;Below this level, PrEP may still be cost-effective.&#x000a0;</p>

Injection drug use currently represents the most significant risk of HIV transmission via the blood-borne route, with an estimated 63 infections for every 10,000 exposures from an infected source.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The number of people acquiring HIV has decreased by 38% from 2010 to 2022, and the rates in children have decreased by 58%. The HIV acquisition rate in Africa has shown a remarkable 3-fold decline from 2010 to 2022, from 1.75 to 0.57 per 1000 population, with the most significant improvements in Eastern and Southern Africa.[WHO.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-hiv-hepatitis-and-stis-programmes/hiv/strategic-information/hiv-data-and-statistics">HIV Data and Statistics.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2023] Heterosexual contact is the most common route of infection worldwide, corresponding to the large number of infections that occur via this route in Africa, where half of all new global infections occur.</p>
        <p>In the United States, more than 36,000 people acquired HIV in 2021&#x02014;the most recent year for which data are currently available.

        <p>There remains much to be accomplished globally and in the United States to prevent HIV. The rates of new infections in Africa remain far higher than those experienced in the rest of the world, with 77% of all incident cases in sub-Saharan Africa occurring in adolescent girls and young women&#x000a0;aged 15 to 24 years in 2022.[UNAIDS.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/UNAIDS_FactSheet_en.pdf">Global HIV Fact Sheet 2022.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2023] The number and rates of new cases have increased in some regions; Eastern Europe and Central Asia, which has a sizeable HIV-positive population, experienced a 49% increase in new infections between 2010 and 2022.[UNAIDS.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://thepath.unaids.org/wp-content/themes/unaids2023/assets/files/2023_report.pdf">Global Report.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2023] However, the increase has been most remarkable in the Middle East and North Africa, with the lowest prevalence globally but the most significant increase in infections at 61% over the same period.</p>

<bold>Key Populations</bold>
</p>
        <p>A broad range of people are at risk for acquiring HIV and should be informed of PrEP; UNAIDS and the WHO have identified priority at-risk populations targeted to receive PrEP: gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals; men who have sex with men (MSM); people who inject drugs; people who partake in occupational sex; and people incarcerated or in other closed settings.[UNAIDS.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://thepath.unaids.org/wp-content/themes/unaids2023/assets/files/2023_report.pdf">Global Report.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2023] Youth from these groups are particularly at risk.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Globally, men who have sex with men face a prevalence of HIV that is 11 times higher than other members of society; this is disproportionately higher in low- and middle-income countries.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="25010898">[44]</ext-link><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="18052602">[45]</ext-link><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="21554742">[46]</ext-link>&#x000a0;As the group with the highest rate of HIV in the United States and most countries in the world outside of Africa, MSM must be a global priority group for HIV prevention.

<bold>Demand for and Use of Preexposure Prophylaxis</bold>
</p>
        <p>Studies show that many participants would like to use PrEP if it were readily available.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="23080358">[53]</ext-link><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="28691439">[54]</ext-link><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="28691439">[63]</ext-link>&#x000a0;However, PrEP remains underutilized, with many barriers to implementation that require the efforts of the entire healthcare team and public health partners to mitigate. In 2022, more than 2.5 million people worldwide received PrEP at least once, far short of the 10 million person target, but a huge advance from 2019, when only 233,000 people were estimated to have received PrEP.[UNAIDS.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://thepath.unaids.org/wp-content/themes/unaids2023/assets/files/2023_report.pdf">Global Report.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2023] The greatest increases in the use of PrEP have occurred in Western and Southern Africa, where rates of HIV acquisition are the highest.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="37415180">[55]</ext-link>&#x000a0;However, this progress is limited to a small number of countries.

        <p>Overall, progress in HIV treatment and prevention in priority groups has stalled between 2010 and 2022&#x02014;and has regressed in some areas. While those in sex occupations and their clients have experienced decreases in infections over this period, in some regions, MSM, transgender individuals, and people who inject drugs have not benefited equally from HIV prevention efforts. Globally, PrEP use among people from key populations remains very low, often under 5%.[UNAIDS.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://thepath.unaids.org/wp-content/themes/unaids2023/assets/files/2023_report.pdf">Global Report.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2023] This can be due to structural barriers from lack of awareness, availability of medications, or affordability to individual beliefs that they are not at risk or not a candidate for PrEP.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Racial, ethnic, and other disparities play a role in low PrEP uptake. For example, in the United States in 2019, approximately 40% of persons eligible for PrEP are Black.

        <p>Conducting a&#x000a0;careful and nonjudgmental sexual and drug use history and assessing for potential risks should be a routine part of clinical care. The history should focus on the risk of acquiring HIV and other sexual or blood-borne infections; this includes the frequency and type of sexual and drug use practices, use of preventive measures, sharing drug use equipment, number of sexual partners, HIV status of partner(s) if known, and whether their partner or partners are from a group with a higher prevalence of HIV. Symptoms of potential sexually transmitted infections should also be sought, as well as a history of hepatitis and hepatitis vaccination status. The clinician should ask about the possibility of pregnancy for all women and transgender men of reproductive age. The International Antiviral Society&#x02013;USA recommends considering additional risks, such as partners who come from high-incidence areas and the use of nonprescription drugs and alcohol.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r18">[18]</xref></p>

        <p>After deciding to prescribe PrEP, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive patient history and a focused physical examination to determine the appropriate therapy, considering factors such as bone loss, renal failure, and cardiac risk factors, including smoking. Weight should be recorded, as PrEP is restricted to those weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb), and some therapies may induce weight gain. Baseline blood pressure should be measured to gauge future cardiovascular risk. A thorough personal and social history can identify potential barriers to adherence to treatment and the need for social or other ancillary supports.</p>
        <p>Limited data exists on whether PrEP provides any additional benefit for people in a monogamous relationship with an HIV-positive partner who is on antiretroviral therapy and with an undetectable viral load&#x02014;though observational evidence suggests there is minimal added benefit of PrEP in limiting HIV transmission in serodiscordant couples with suppressed viral loads.

        <p>HIV testing is the first step in the evaluation of any patient who requests PrEP or may be at risk for HIV. A documented negative HIV test within 7 days before initiating, reinitiating, or continuing PrEP is crucial.

        <p>Antiretroviral medications used as PrEP are highly effective in decreasing HIV acquisition. These medications should be offered based on clinical judgment to all high-risk individuals as defined by local, state, or country guidelines. While the WHO highlights the need for PrEP according to key populations, individual countries or other authorities develop guidelines based on country or local epidemiology, and clinicians make decisions based on local epidemiology and individual risk factors.</p>
        <p>It is essential to consult the most recent guidelines when assisting patients in making decisions for PrEP as new indications and agents become available.

        <p>The individuals most at risk of HIV often have challenges with adhering to therapy due to multiple structural and systemic barriers, and loss to follow-up is common.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r21">[30]</xref>&#x000a0;Barriers may include a lack or loss of insurance, exposure to abuse and violence, such as&#x000a0;a partner throwing medications away, major stressful life events, the stigma of being at risk for HIV, discrimination, or other factors beyond the patient's control. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, decreased rates of prescription refills were observed, which may not be associated with changes in sexual behaviors.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="33534275">[66]</ext-link><bold>&#x000a0;</bold>Young adults experienced more barriers to accessing health services, and people who identify as Hispanic/Latin American, Black/African American, or other non-White identities or those who were on public health insurance had more lapses in PrEP.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="33534275">[66]</ext-link><bold>&#x000a0;</bold>Medical conditions such as mental health or substance use issues can also lead to decreased medication adherence.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="23264842">[67]</ext-link></p>
        <p>When a patient who takes oral PrEP presents,&#x000a0;members of the interprofessional&#x000a0;should&#x000a0;pay close attention to&#x000a0;the patient's adherence to therapy and potential barriers to adherence during every clinical visit, and collective problem-solving should be&#x000a0;engaged to overcome the identified obstacles. Data from clinical trials and observational studies have demonstrated that adherence to therapy is essential to PrEP effectiveness. A pharmacokinetic study of oral PrEP estimated effectiveness to be 99% if doses are taken 7 days a week, 96% for 4 doses per week, and 76% for 2 doses per week.[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-guidelines-2021.pdf">PrEP Guidelines.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2021] While this suggests that 100% adherence is not required for benefit, optimal benefit is only achieved with high adherence rates. Also, lower levels of active metabolites of PrEP medications have been found in vaginal tissues as compared with colorectal tissues, strongly suggesting that greater adherence may be required for women taking PrEP.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Patients receiving cabotegravir injections must be advised that if they discontinue medication, the gradually declining levels of cabotegravir raise the risk of developing a drug-resistant strain if HIV infection occurs at that time.[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-guidelines-2021.pdf">PrEP Guidelines.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2021] Therefore, individuals need to keep regular injection appointments.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>While adherence to therapy may be improved with intramuscular cabotegravir due to the simple bimonthly dosing schedule, patients may experience barriers similar to those encountered with oral PrEP due to the need for ongoing connection with healthcare services. Medication adherence requires an interdisciplinary team approach that identifies and addresses all adherence barriers.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Patients with Substance Use Disorders</bold>
</p>
        <p>People who inject drugs should be offered PrEP. In addition, efforts should be made to decrease or eliminate the risk of acquiring HIV through needle sharing by offering drug treatment and relapse prevention services. Medication-assisted treatment with buprenorphine, naltrexone, or methadone can be provided in the PrEP setting or by referral to a specialized clinic. If the patient is unable or not motivated to engage in drug treatment services, access to sterile injection equipment should be facilitated, where available and legal, through syringe services programs, prescriptions, or the purchase of needles without a prescription. Cognitive or behavioral counseling and referral to mental health or social services may also reduce high-risk practices.[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-guidelines-2021.pdf">PrEP Guidelines.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2021]&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p>

        <title>Differential Diagnosis</title>
        <p>The possibility of prior acquisition of HIV is the crucial alternative diagnosis to consider when a person seeks or is considering PrEP. HIV testing is vital before initiating therapy, with a confirmatory nucleic acid amplification test required if a recent high-risk exposure is identified or acute HIV illness is suspected. HIV testing must also be performed before each prescription refill or injection.</p>
        <p>Persons at risk for HIV often have other risks that may impact their health and should be considered as appropriate to the patient's medical and social history and clinical presentation. Other risks and suggested treatments include&#x000a0;those listed below.</p>

        <p>While HIV is not curable, people who are infected can live long, healthy lives due to the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapies. The prognosis for individuals seeking prevention of HIV infection is excellent if treatment adherence can be maintained. The effectiveness of oral PrEP in preventing HIV acquisition during sexual contact is approximately 99% when medication is strictly adhered to; effectiveness is significantly decreased if adherence is not maintained.[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-guidelines-2021.pdf">PrEP Guidelines.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2021] Pooled analyses of results from large trials of TDF/FTC versus placebo showed a relative risk of HIV acquisition of 0.46 after 4 months to 4 years of follow-up.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="31184746">[68]</ext-link>&#x000a0;After categorizing study outcomes based on PrEP adherence levels, the relative risk was 0.27 for studies with adherence of 70% or higher, 0.51 for studies with adherence between 40% and less than 70%, and 0.93 (95% CI .72-1.2).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r19">[52]</xref></p>

        <p>Overall, tenofovir formulations are well tolerated by most individuals, with overall rates of any adverse event identical between the 2 formulations at 94%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r21">[21]</xref><bold>&#x000a0;</bold>About 10% of patients starting oral PrEP experience what is known as a "startup syndrome," consisting of headache, nausea, and abdominal discomfort that usually resolves within the first month. The use of over-the-counter medications is recommended to treat these symptoms. Some patients on TAF/FTC report weight gain; appropriate lifestyle intervention measures should be recommended.[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-guidelines-2021.pdf">PrEP Guidelines.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2021]</p>
        <p>The ATN 110 and 113 studies showed decreased bone density in young men taking TDF/FTC oral PrEP compared to placebo, with greater declines in those aged 15 to 19 than those aged 20 to 22.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r22">[22]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r23">[23]</xref>&#x000a0;While declines resolved during the 48 weeks after the studies were completed, declines were persistent in younger men.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r21">[21]</xref>[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-guidelines-2021.pdf">PrEP Guidelines.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2021]</p>
        <p>Serious adverse events are reported in about 7% of both formulations, with between 1.5% and 1.9% of patients needing to stop the medication due to adverse events. Rates of kidney adverse events, kidney adverse events leading to discontinuation of therapy, and fracture were the same.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="32711800">[71]</ext-link>&#x000a0;Rarely, tenofovir-based medications can cause acute renal injury; patients should be advised of signs and symptoms and to follow up urgently with a physician. Given these precautions, guidelines recommend that tenofovir disoproxil<bold>&#x000a0;</bold>is avoided when the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and TAF is avoided when the eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="15889353">[72]</ext-link><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="28064418">[73]</ext-link></p>
        <p>Long-acting cabotegravir and TDF/FTC likewise demonstrated similar risks of serious adverse events.

        <p>
<bold>Potential for Drug Interactions</bold>
</p>
        <p>Recommended tenofovir formulations are known to interact with many drugs, including many often prescribed in conjunction with PrEP. TAF should not be coadministered with rifampicin, rifabutin, or rifapentin.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="30815689">[74]</ext-link>&#x000a0;Tenofovir alafenamide should not be coadministered with St. John's Wort, as decreased TAF concentrations are possible due to greater P-glycoprotein manipulation than with TDF.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="32295453">[75]</ext-link>[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-guidelines-2021.pdf">PrEP Guidelines.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2021]</p>
        <p>By comparison, TDF interacts with several medications for which TAF data are unavailable.[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-guidelines-2021.pdf">PrEP Guidelines.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2021] When TDF is coadministered with some antiretrovirals, aminoglycosides, high-dose or multiple nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and other medications that reduce renal function or compete for active renal tubular secretion, increased serum concentrations of TDF and these drugs may result.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="32295453">[75]</ext-link>&#x000a0;Other acyclic nucleotide drugs, such as adefovir and cidofovir, should not be coadministered with TDF as serum concentrations of TDF may be increased and cause substantial nephrotoxicity. When TDF is taken with ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, or voxilaprevir, this may result in increased serum concentrations of TDF.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="31081036">[76]</ext-link><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="27841981">[77]</ext-link>&#x000a0;These have no significant effect on TAF. Dose-related toxicities must be monitored when interactions may occur.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>No significant interactions have been found when TDF or TAF&#x000a0;is coadministered with buprenorphine, methadone, or oral contraceptives, and no dosage adjustments are necessary.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="23656339">[78]</ext-link><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="19637945">[79]</ext-link></p>
        <p>No studies on interactions with masculinizing hormones exist, and data&#x000a0;are limited on feminizing hormones. Some study results suggest lower tenofovir concentrations in blood and rectal tissue with the concurrent use of feminizing hormones; however, this evidence is limited by small sample sizes and potential recall bias.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="30963179">[80]</ext-link><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="31298497">[81]</ext-link><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="31692269">[82]</ext-link>&#x000a0;However, TDF is not known to affect levels of feminizing hormones.

        <p>Cabotegravir should not be coadministered with rifampicin or rifapentin due to increased metabolism and significantly reduced levels of cabotegravir.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="28739783">[83]</ext-link>[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-guidelines-2021.pdf">PrEP Guidelines.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2021] Rifabutin moderately increases the metabolism of cabotegravir and can be coadministered with caution. Until further data are available, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital should not be coadministered with cabotegravir as these convulsants may lower cabotegravir levels. Hormonal contraceptives can safely be taken with cabotegravir, but data on coadministration with feminizing hormones are lacking.[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-guidelines-2021.pdf">PrEP Guidelines.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2021]</p>
        <p>
<bold>HIV Acquisition</bold>
</p>
        <p>Acquiring HIV infection while being prescribed PrEP mainly occurs due to nonadherence to medication by stopping, infrequently using, or stopping and starting treatment.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="36894453">[84]</ext-link>&#x000a0;Socioeconomic disadvantage and a lack of awareness of the risks may contribute to nonadherence. Rarely, infection can occur despite high adherence because of exposure to a drug-resistant strain or simply because PrEP protection is not 100%.[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-provider-supplement-2021.pdf">PrEP Supplement.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2021]</p>
        <p>When a follow-up test indicates possible HIV infection, a history should be taken, seeking signs and symptoms of acute HIV testing. Confirmatory testing&#x000a0;is required unless the initial test was laboratory testing with confirmatory results already known. Diagnosis of HIV in patients on cabotegravir can be challenging due to cabotegravir's high potency and long half-life, resulting in repeat indeterminate or conflicting results, including those between qualitative and quantitative nucleic acid amplification test results.[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-provider-supplement-2021.pdf">PrEP Supplement.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2021]</p>
        <p>PrEP may need to be stopped or augmented with additional antiretroviral medication while confirmatory laboratory testing is completed. Once a diagnosis of HIV is confirmed, draw appropriate specimens for evaluating HIV infection and initiate antiretroviral therapy. A case report form should be completed for submission to the local health department.[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-provider-supplement-2021.pdf">PrEP Supplement.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2021]</p>

Guidelines on PrEP from the WHO, national health departments, the CDC, and other organizations identify barriers to care and provide evidence-based recommendations to improve PrEP policies, programs, and services.[WHO.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/360348/9789240053779-eng.pdf?sequence=1">Global Health Sector Strategies for HIV</ext-link>&#x000a0;2022][WHO.

<bold>Increasing PrEP Awareness</bold>
</p>
        <p>Some providers are not aware of prevention measures such as PrEP and treatment as prevention, or they have judgmental attitudes that lead to a lack of sharing and promoting information about these measures with people at risk of or living with HIV.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="34036459">[85]</ext-link><bold>&#x000a0;</bold>Education targeting healthcare professionals should be broad to ensure information and support are available to the patient where and when needed. This support system includes generalized primary care practitioners well known to the patient and others with less frequent connections, such as community health service providers, pharmacists, or specialist physicians.</p>
        <p>Healthcare professionals, including primary care physicians, advanced practitioners, pharmacists, and public health practitioners, can all increase awareness of PrEP among people at risk of HIV. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or inject nonprescribed drugs should be aware of measures to prevent the acquisition of HIV, including PrEP.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r18">[57]</xref>[WHO.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids#:~:text=HIV%20continues%20to%20be%20a,2.0%20million%5D%20people%20acquired%20HIV.">HIV Factsheet.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2023] Awareness can also be raised through social networks and in low-barrier healthcare services such as those provided in treatment centers, supported housing, or by community health workers.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Program and Service Improvement</bold>
</p>
        <p>Efforts to improve programming by nurse managers, physicians, and health care administrators should be targeted based on local data, and learnings from implementation science should be used to best deliver services to the patient population. Patients who currently access services and those who do not should be considered.</p>
        <p>Engagement in PrEP treatment allows many patients to engage safely and productively with the healthcare system, often for the first time. As such, other medical needs should be identified and addressed or a referral made, including vaccinations; screening and care for depression, alcohol use, and smoking; and screening for breast, cervical, or prostate cancer.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="23041705">[86]</ext-link><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="33417201">[87]</ext-link></p>
        <p>However, the need for long-term connection to healthcare services for those who use PrEP can also present barriers to treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that people can be trusted to take responsibility for a greater portion of their care, with outcomes maintained using innovative solutions such as telehealth replacing some or all in-clinic visits.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="32853536">[88]</ext-link><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="36204596">[89]</ext-link>[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-guidelines-2021.pdf">PrEP Guidelines.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2021] Consults for screening, initiating, or continuing PrEP can be&#x000a0;conducted using phone or web-based platforms. Specified HIV, sexually transmitted infections, or other PrEP-related tests can be mailed to patients' homes, and home collection can be used, with laboratory visits used only where necessary. The advent of point-of-care and self-testing options for an increasing number of tests facilitates further innovation in this area.</p>

        <p>The most effective means for people who inject drugs to prevent transmitting or acquiring HIV is to stop injecting.

        <p>
<bold>Regulatory and Policy Environments</bold>
</p>
        <p>Regulatory and policy environments vary significantly across the world, with few countries achieving optimal conditions for HIV prevention. Practitioners, public health officials, researchers, and community leaders can influence regulatory and policy environments via targeted advocacy.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Laws and regulations related to HIV testing and the provision of PrEP in adolescent minors vary by jurisdiction; these include consent, confidentiality, parental disclosure, and circumstances requiring reporting to local authorities. While often desirable, the involvement of parents or guardians can sometimes be contradicted due to patient safety. Clinicians need to be aware of any local laws and regulations that may apply when providing PrEP to adolescent minors.</p>
        <p>The addition of PrEP to locally available prevention measures is necessary to end global HIV transmission, particularly in areas with a high burden of HIV.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41380.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;However, recommendations for PrEP have not been adopted in national guidelines in Russia, China, Angola, Libya, Sudan, and Venezuela, among others, limiting the quality and effectiveness of HIV prevention efforts in those countries and worldwide.[WHO.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/hq-hiv-hepatitis-and-stis-library/who-hiv-policy-adoption-in-countries_2023.pdf?sfvrsn=e2720212_1">HIV Policy Adoption Fact Sheet.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2023] Only 9 countries in Latin America provide oral and on-demand PrEP to people from key populations.[UNAIDS.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://thepath.unaids.org/wp-content/themes/unaids2023/assets/files/2023_report.pdf">Global Report.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2023] In Western and Central Europe and North America, 30 of 42 countries have adopted the WHO recommendations for PrEP.[UNAIDS.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://thepath.unaids.org/wp-content/themes/unaids2023/assets/files/2023_report.pdf">Global Report.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2023]</p>
        <p>Significant prevention gaps often exist in the context of punitive laws, police harassment, or harsh stigma and discrimination. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa, the incidence of HIV infection amongst MSM is 5 per 100,000 person-years, which is 27 to 150 times higher than in other boys and adult men aged 15 or older. Even where WHO PrEP recommendations have been adopted, other local legislation can decrease the effectiveness of implementation. For example, while transgender rights were strengthened in 2022 in Kuwait and Spain, setbacks occurred in others, including Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Uganda, Zimbabwe, and the United States.[UNAIDS.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://thepath.unaids.org/wp-content/themes/unaids2023/assets/files/2023_report.pdf">Global Report.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2023] Most countries (145) still criminalize the use or possession of small amounts of drugs; 168 countries criminalize some aspect&#x000a0;of&#x000a0;occupational sex; 67 countries criminalize consensual same-sex intercourse; 20 countries criminalize transgender people; and 143 countries criminalize or otherwise prosecute HIV exposure, nondisclosure, or transmission.[UNAIDS.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://thepath.unaids.org/wp-content/themes/unaids2023/assets/files/2023_report.pdf">Global Report.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2023]</p>
        <p>
<bold>Funding&#x000a0;</bold>
</p>
        <p>Sufficient and stable funding for HIV programming is of critical importance for preventing HIV, influencing the availability and penetration of interventions, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="35925943">[98]</ext-link>&#x000a0;Yet total funding for HIV programming in low- and middle-income countries was 2.6% lower in 2022 than in 2021, the third annual decrease in a row and well short of what is needed to achieve targets.[UNAIDS.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://thepath.unaids.org/wp-content/themes/unaids2023/assets/files/2023_report.pdf">Global Report.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2023] External funding has decreased for several years, with low- and middle-income countries funding about 60% of their HIV programming in 2022, up from about 50% in 2010.[UNAIDS.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://thepath.unaids.org/wp-content/themes/unaids2023/assets/files/2023_report.pdf">Global Report.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2023] This gap in funding has increased since the COVID-19 pandemic emerged.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>This is particularly true for new PrEP technologies. In the United States, the initial pricing for long-acting cabotegravir was $22,000 per year. Under a voluntary licensing agreement, about 90 countries across Africa (except Libya) and other low- and lower-middle-income countries can purchase less expensive generic versions of cabotegravir.[UNAIDS.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://thepath.unaids.org/wp-content/themes/unaids2023/assets/files/2023_report.pdf">Global Report.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2023] However, generic production will take years to scale up, and the costs may remain prohibitively high for impoverished people. Upper- and middle-income regions such as Latin America, where the incidence of HIV is increasing, are not included in the deal.[UNAIDS.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://thepath.unaids.org/wp-content/themes/unaids2023/assets/files/2023_report.pdf">Global Report.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2023] Public subsidization of PrEP can face additional barriers, such as a lack of public support for subsidization in many jurisdictions.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="32976358">[99]</ext-link></p>
        <p>Programs in many locations make PrEP agents more affordable in many countries, including the United States. These may offer assistance with medication costs, copayments, and insurance. However, annual drug costs remain prohibitive for many. Several companies that manufacture antiretrovirals also have programs for individuals who cannot afford PrEP. Most US insurers cover the cost of PrEP, but copayments may be very high. For those without insurance, some medication assistance programs provide PrEP for free.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Similar to regulatory and policy environments, funding environments vary considerably worldwide. Practitioners, public health officials, researchers, and community leaders can effectively influence governments or funding agencies to prioritize HIV prevention funding.</p>
        <p><bold>Addressing Stigma</bold>&#x000a0;<bold>and Other Determinants of Health</bold></p>
        <p>Multiple sources of evidence support the notion that stigma and other socioeconomic factors affect access to prevention and care services, leading to poorer health outcomes. Individuals who are racialized, gender-diverse, disabled, migrant, unhoused, incarcerated, impoverished, or otherwise marginalized have decreased access to HIV testing, care, and prevention.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="34036459">[85]</ext-link><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="35925943">[98]</ext-link><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="30629090">[100]</ext-link>&#x000a0;Decreased access to HIV testing, care, and preventive measures&#x000a0;can result in individuals in these groups having lower knowledge of their HIV status, lower awareness of risk, lower awareness of PrEP and other prevention measures, and lower rates of viral suppression. Addressing inequities at the healthcare provider, social, and system levels is&#x000a0;key to achieving the WHO goals for HIV prevention.[WHO.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/360348/9789240053779-eng.pdf?sequence=1">Global Health Sector HIV Strategies.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2022]&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>For example, among the countries that reported, at least 33% stated that more than 10% of people from key populations avoid healthcare due to accompanying stigma and discrimination. More than half of countries reported avoidance of healthcare among those in sex occupations, people who inject drugs, and transgender people. Among the 5 countries that reported, an astonishing 72% of transgender people reported experiencing stigma in the last 6 months.[UNAIDS.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://thepath.unaids.org/wp-content/themes/unaids2023/assets/files/2023_report.pdf">Global Report.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2023]</p>
        <p>The prevalence of HIV was found to be 2.1% for heterosexual people living in urban poverty areas in the United States, more than 20 times greater than the rate among all heterosexuals in the United States.[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/poverty.html">HIV - Communities in Crisis.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2019] Household income was inversely correlated with HIV prevalence. People unemployed due to disability lived with HIV at 7 times the rate of those who were employed. The prevalence of HIV in areas of urban poverty in the United States was similar to that of low-income countries with generalized epidemics, such as Ethiopia and Haiti.[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/poverty.html">HIV - Communities in Crisis.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2019] Unlike in the entire US population, rates did not differ significantly by race or ethnicity in populations living in urban poverty. However, Black/African American gay and bisexual men have lower use of PrEP as compared to other ethnicities.[CDC.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/gay-bisexual-men/index.html">HIV and Gay and Bisexual Men.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2021]&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Efforts to improve determinants of health in the interest of preventing HIV can have additional benefits for patients and communities facing discrimination or other inequities. As an illustration, the global AIDS strategy includes a sub-target aiming to reduce the proportion of individuals from key populations who encounter physical or sexual violence to no more than 10%. This is crucial, as those experiencing such violence are at a heightened risk of HIV. In 2022, a median of 29% of transgender people (in 11 reporting countries), 28% of people who inject drugs (8 reporting countries), 20% of those in sex occupations (21 reporting countries), and 8% of gay men and other men who have sex with men (19 reporting countries) experienced violence in the past 12 months.[UNAIDS.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://thepath.unaids.org/wp-content/themes/unaids2023/assets/files/2023_report.pdf">Global Report.</ext-link>&#x000a0;2023] Reducing sexual and physical violence can also lead to decreased injuries and improved mental health outcomes, among other benefits.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p>
