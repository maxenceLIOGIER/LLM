        <p>The primary function of the FLM and FBM is eversion of the foot and ankle, while their secondary function is ankle plantarflexion.

        <title>Embryology</title>
        <p>The formation of a human limb is a complex process embryologically, with numerous molecular signaling pathways and factors being involved. Limbs arise from limb buds, which are small buds of undifferentiated lateral plate mesoderm cells surrounded by ectoderm cells. The lateral plate mesoderm cells give rise to the connective tissues of the limb, such as bone, cartilage, muscle, and tendon. Cells that migrate from the somites to the lateral plate mesoderm also gives rise to muscle cells. The limb buds are located bilaterally, on two distinct levels of the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. The limb buds located by the cervical-thoracic transition give rise to the upper limbs (forelimbs), while the limb buds located by the lumbar-sacral transition give rise to the lower limbs (hindlimbs). Specific genes, Pitx1 and Hox, have been found to determine the identity of limbs; whether they will be forelimbs or hindlimbs. Pitx1 has been found in the lateral plate mesoderm, and regulates Tbx4 expression, helping to form a hindlimb identity. Hox4 and Hox5 regulate Tbx5 expression and help to form a forelimb identity. Hox genes also contribute to the development of the interlimb region, including the vertebral column.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32240.r17">[17]</xref></p>
        <p>Signaling regions in the limb buds control the growth of the lateral plate mesoderm in three different positional planes: dorso-ventral (from the back of the hand to the palms), AP (from the thumb to the 5th digit), and the proximo-distal (from the shoulder to the fingertips).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32240.r17">[17]</xref></p>

        <p>The common fibular nerve normally splits into the superficial fibular nerve and the deep fibular nerve within the fibular tunnel, which is formed laterally by the deep fascia, medially by the fibular head, and anteriorly and posterior by the origin of the fibularis longus off the fibular head and fibular shaft.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32240.r13">[13]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32240.r18">[18]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32240.r13">[13]</xref></p>

        <title>Muscles</title>
        <p>There are normally two muscles in the lateral leg compartment, the FLM and FBM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32240.r7">[7]</xref> The FLM is the more superficial and longer of the two muscles. It originates on the superolateral surface of the fibular head, proximal two-thirds of the fibular shaft, the lateral tibial condyle, and the intermuscular septum.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32240.r3">[3]</xref> The FBM is located deep and medial to the FLM, and it is shorter than the FLM. The FBM originates on the lower two-thirds of the lateral fibular shaft and the anterior intermuscular septum. The muscle fibers of the FLM descend vertically and become the FLT along the midpoint of the lateral leg compartment. The muscle fibers of the FBM also descend vertically and become the FBT. THE FLT and FBT run together in the common fibular synovial sheath along the posterior aspect of the lateral malleolus, within the retro-malleolar groove. The FLT runs posterior to the FBT in the common fibular synovial sheath. The common fibular synovial sheath spans 4cm proximal and 1cm distal to the lateral malleolus. The common fibular synovial sheath is secured within the retro-malleolar groove by the superior fibular retinaculum. As the common fibular synovial sheath travels behind and under the lateral malleolus, it eventually splits into separate synovial sheaths for the FLT and FBT at the fibular trochlea (a bony prominence of the calcaneus). The inferior fibular retinaculum originates on the lateral sinus tarsi and attaches to the fibular trochlea and lateral calcaneus, and it secures the tendon synovial sheaths at the fibular trochlea. Its attachment to the fibular trochlea forms two separate compartments for the FLT and FBT, with the FBT synovial tendon sheath running in the compartment superior to the fibular trochlea, and the FLT synovial tendon sheath running in the compartment inferior to the fibular trochlea.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The FBT inserts onto the lateral aspect of the tuberosity at the base of the 5th metatarsal.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32240.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>The FLT&#x000a0; travels inferolateral along the calcaneus, and when it reaches the cuboid bone, the FLT tendon may have an os peroneum (a fibrocartilaginous nodule) that articulates with the cuboid, forming the peroneocuboid joint. The presence of this joint is variable. Distal to the cuboid, the FLT makes a sharp turn, passing between the calcaneal tuberosity and the base of the 5th metatarsal, traversing the cuboid tunnel anteromedially, and entering the plantar aspect of the foot. From there, the FLT inserts onto the base of the first metatarsal, with its synovial tendon sheath ending right before it inserts. Variable insertions of the FLT include the medial cuneiform, the plantar aspect of the base of the 2nd- 5th metatarsals, and the first dorsal interosseous muscle.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32240.r18">[18]</xref></p>

        <p>Fibularis Quartus (FQ)&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The FQ is a common accessory muscle in the ankle, with a prevalence of 4.3 to 21.7%. Possible origins of the FQ are the distal FBM (most common) and the distal fibula. The possible insertions of the FQ are the retrofibular trochlea of the calcaneus (most common), the base of the 5th metatarsal, and the cuboid bone. The FQ assists with supporting the lateral edge of the foot during eversion, as well as lateral foot and ankle stabilization. The presence of an FQ can increase a patient&#x02019;s risk of FBT degeneration through stenosis of the lateral leg compartment, which may cause lateral ankle instability. On the contrary, the FQ can be used to reconstruct a ruptured superior fibular retinaculum. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to be aware of the presence of the FQ, as it may be a cause of chronic lateral ankle instability, as well as be used in surgical reconstruction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32240.r6">[6]</xref> In patients with a symptomatic FQ, orthotics can be utilized, and if those are ineffective, surgical ablation of the FQ can be performed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32240.r19">[19]</xref></p>

<italic toggle="yes">Supernumerary Fibularis Muscle Bellies&#x000a0;</italic>
</p>
        <p>Although a very rare occurrence, patients may also have the presence of double fibularis muscle bellies, each with their own tendon. The FLM can have its normal origin, then divide into one large superficial muscle belly, with its normal FLM and FLT structure and insertion. It can also have a smaller deep muscle belly, which became a tendon after 8.6cm, and inserted into the lateral calcaneus directly inferior to the lateral malleolus. The point where the FLM split into two muscle bellies was 22.1cm proximal to the lateral malleolus. Additionally, the FBM originated in its normal location, and split into two muscle bellies, with one being superficial and lateral, and one being deep and medial. The split occurred 8.2cm proximal to the lateral malleolus. The superficial and lateral muscle belly followed the normal anatomy of the FBM and FBL, while the deep and medial muscle belly had a tendinous insertion on the lateral calcaneus, 1.4cm inferior to the lateral malleolus. There was 1.4cm of space between the insertions of the deep muscles of the FLT and FBT on the calcaneus. In conclusion, supernumerary fibularis muscles are an anatomic variant that can be found, and it is important to be aware of their occurrence while performing reconstruction surgeries involving the lateral leg compartment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32240.r8">[8]</xref></p>

</p>
        <p>Patients who have acute compartment syndrome or CECS that has not responded to conservative treatment require surgical intervention to relieve the symptoms associated with their condition and to prevent progressive damage. Patients with CECS of their lateral compartment have high surgical success rates at an average of two years following surgery, with a systematic review finding that 90% of patients had successful lateral compartment surgery. However, the success rate of surgical intervention for CECS as a whole (with different compartments being affected), was lower at 66%. Therefore, surgical intervention in patients who have lateral compartment CECS is more efficacious than surgical intervention in other lower leg compartments.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32240.r10">[10]</xref></p>

        <p>Many different incision locations and techniques are used. It is imperative that incisions are placed in locations that provide access to the fascial compartment that is being treated, and that incisions minimize iatrogenic neurovascular injury. It has been shown that while performing a fasciotomy of the anterior and lateral compartments, ultrasound can be utilized to locate the intermuscular septum separating the anterior and lateral compartments, providing a good location for surgeons to place their incision directly over the septum, in order to prevent damage to neurovascular structures in the area. Limitations of US include that it is not effective in patients with increased BMIs, especially patients who are obese, and the accuracy of US is heavily operator-dependent. Therefore, when properly trained individuals are utilizing US to locate the intermuscular septum between the anterior and lateral leg compartments, it can be an effective guide on the surgical incision placement.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32240.r21">[21]</xref></p>

Additionally, when the surgical duration is expected to exceed four hours, the lithotomy position should be relieved for a few minutes every two hours, to prevent excessive lower leg compression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32240.r12">[12]</xref></p>
        <p>It is also important to be careful when performing surgical operations that utilize lower limb compression stockings for DVT prophylaxis.

The patient returned two days following the operation with symptoms of acute compartment syndrome and needed surgical intervention.

        <p>When ischemia occurs for a prolonged time, necrosis can occur, resulting in the replacement of muscle with fibrous scar tissue (Volkmann&#x02019;s Ischemic Contracture). Rhabdomyolysis may also occur, which can cause acute renal injury and cardiac arrhythmias.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32240.r15">[15]</xref> Therefore, swift diagnosis and treatment of compartment syndrome are essential to prevent irreversible damage. The diagnosis of compartment syndrome is a clinical diagnosis, utilizing an adequate history, physical examination, intracompartmental pressure (ICP), ultrasound (US), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Surgical intervention for patients who need it should not be delayed by the lack of ICP or MRI availability, as &#x0201c;time is muscle.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32240.r25">[25]</xref></p>

<bold>Muscular Injury&#x000a0;</bold>
</p>
        <p>Injuries to the lateral leg compartment muscles normally involve the distal tendons of the fibularis muscles, with a prevalence of 11-37% in cadavers, which makes it a common occurrence. Additionally, in patients who have surgical correction of ankle instability, 30% of them have tears in the distal fibularis tendons. The FBM is more likely to be injured than the FLM, with tears of the proximal fibularis longus musculotendinous junction being a very rare occurrence. They can occur from an inversion ankle sprain mechanism, or from direct trauma to the proximal lateral leg compartment. Tears of the proximal fibular longus musculotendinous junction are commonly associated with lateral leg compartment syndrome, with the majority of the published case-studies reporting both conditions simultaneously. Therefore, it is important to keep lateral leg compartment syndrome on the differential diagnosis if a proximal fibularis longus musculotendinous tear is suspected. If patients have clinical symptoms of compartment syndrome with a proximal fibularis longus musculotendinous tear, the majority of them need to be corrected surgically. In other cases, patients may complain of numbness or tingling along the distribution of the common fibular nerve and superficial fibular nerve, along with swelling in the lateral leg compartment, which may be caused by compression of the nerves secondary to hemorrhage of the damaged structures, or from the traction of the nerves. Without the presence of other symptoms of lateral leg compartment syndrome, patients with these symptoms may be treated conservatively with a controlled ankle motion (CAM) boot and physical therapy, and achieve good outcomes. It is very important to use sound clinical judgment when managing patients with proximal fibularis longus musculotendinous junction injuries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32240.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>Although rarely reported in the literature, patients may also have ruptures of the origin of their EPM, which may cause lateral compartment syndrome and isolated deep fibular nerve palsy. Patients with isolated deep fibular nerve palsy can present with drop foot since the deep fibular nerve normally supplies the tibialis anterior, which performs ankle dorsiflexion. Typically caused by lumbar disc herniation, if patients present with drop foot, along with symptoms of a proximal EPM tear, it is important to keep lateral compartment syndrome causing deep fibular nerve palsy on the differential diagnosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32240.r13">[13]</xref></p>
