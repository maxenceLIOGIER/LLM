        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Medical errors have more recently been recognized as a serious public health problem, reported as the third leading cause of death in the US.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r1">[1]</xref> However, because medical errors are comprised of different types of failures (eg, diagnostic or medication errors) that can result in various outcomes (eg, near-miss, injury, or no harm), estimates of the incidence of medical errors vary widely in studies. One study reported that approximately 400,000 hospitalized patients experience some preventable harm each year, while another&#x000a0;estimated that &#x0003e;200,000 patient deaths annually&#x000a0;were due to preventable medical errors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;Moreover, the reported cost of medical errors is wide-ranging, with some experts estimating $20 billion each year and others approximating&#x000a0;healthcare costs of $35.7 to $45 billion annually for hospital-acquired infections alone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>The definition of a medical error varies, making analysis via uniform objectives difficult. Furthermore, a lack of standardized terminology has hindered data assessment, synthesis, and evaluation. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) Committee on Quality of Health Care in the US, which performed the first large study on medical errors, defined a medical error as "the failure of a planned action to be completed as&#x000a0;intended or the use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim."<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Another definition identifies medical errors as a failure in care that may or may not result in patient harm.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;Regardless of the definition, medical errors are associated with high morbidity, mortality, and economic burden. Moreover, they can negatively impact the patient, their family, involved clinicians and support staff, the healthcare facility, and the community.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;Healthcare professionals may experience profound psychological effects (eg, anger, guilt, inadequacy, depression, and suicidal ideation) due to actual or perceived errors, which the threat of impending legal action may compound. Clinicians can also equate errors with failure, a breach of public trust, and patient injury despite their mandate to do no harm, which may&#x000a0;lead to decreased clinical confidence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <p>Some experts believe the term <italic toggle="yes">error</italic> is excessively antagonistic and perpetuates a blame culture. Due to the negative connotation, limited use of the term is prudent when documenting patient records; some experts suggest the term not be used at all. However, adverse events secondary to medical errors occur; therefore, simply discontinuing the word's usage will not prevent or reduce these errors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;Uncovering the cause of these errors, as well as providing viable solutions to avoid these errors from occurring, is challenging.&#x000a0;Healthcare professionals should be familiar with the different types of medical errors to understand better the adverse events that may be caused.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Common types of medical errors include surgical errors, diagnostic errors, medication errors, equipment failures, patient falls, hospital-acquired infections, and communication failures. By identifying the deficiencies, failures, and risk factors that lead to an adverse event, corrective measures can be developed to prevent similar errors. Encouraging individuals involved in every aspect of healthcare to report medical errors is essential to this process. Confidential reporting options are necessary to identify deficiencies or failures a system may contain.&#x000a0;Changing workplace culture and developing protocols for&#x000a0;addressing medical errors can encourage medical error reporting. Institutions that adopt a patient safety culture and&#x000a0;implement corrective interventions can make healthcare safer for patients and healthcare workers.

        <title>Function</title>
        <p>Patient safety has previously been outcome-dependent, focusing on preventing adverse patient outcomes. However, several studies have recognized that understanding the organizational failures that often lead to medical errors is critical to developing effective prevention strategies. To accurately identify the type of medical errors occurring, assess their prevalence, and determine potential inciting events, healthcare professionals must be familiar with the nomenclature typically utilized.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r11">[11]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Active and Latent Errors</bold>
</p>
        <p>An active error is a specific event that causes patient harm and involves the healthcare professionals providing some aspect of patient care, such as operating on the wrong eye.&#x000a0;A latent error consists of intrinsic failures within the patient care process (eg, faulty equipment, ineffective organizational structure, or poor system design).&#x000a0;These errors may go unnoticed for a long time without adverse effects.&#x000a0;Latent errors are typically "accidents waiting to happen." An example of a latent error is a malfunctioning ventilator machine. However, the clinician's failure to check the device before use is an active error.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Medical Error</bold>
</p>
        <p>The IOM defined a medical error as the failure to complete the intended plan of action or implementation of the wrong plan to achieve an intended outcome. Other experts characterized medical errors as deviations from the standard care process that may or may not result in patient injury. Additionally, medical errors can be categorized as either errors of omission or commission.&#x000a0;Errors of omission cause adverse events through actions not taken (eg, not strapping a patient into a wheelchair or not stabilizing a gurney before patient transfer), while errors of commission occur secondary to a direct action by a healthcare team member (eg,&#x000a0;administering a medication to a&#x000a0;patient with a known allergy or mislabeling a laboratory specimen with the wrong patient name.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Subsequently, some experts define an adverse event as an act of omission or commission in medical management planning or execution that causes or can potentially cause patient harm.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;Subtypes of medical errors include errors of communication, diagnostic errors, surgical errors, and patient suicide.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r2">[2]</xref> (Refer to the <bold>Issues of Concern</bold>&#x000a0;section for more information on the types of medical errors.)</p>
        <p>
<bold>Adverse Event</bold>
</p>
        <p>The IOM identifies an adverse event as a patient injury resulting in disability or prolonged hospitalization caused by medical or surgical management rather than the patient's underlying condition. Adverse events can also include&#x000a0;complications from prolonged hospitalization or factors inherent in the healthcare system. However, not all adverse outcomes are the result of a medical error. Instead, a&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">preventable adverse event</italic>&#x000a0;refers to a patient injury caused by a medical&#x000a0;error.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Preventable adverse events are further categorized into the following subgroups:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p><bold>Negligent adverse event</bold>: Legal negligence is the failure of an average, qualified healthcare worker to meet the reasonably expected standard of care for a patient with similar circumstances (eg, failure to check a pathology report resulting in a missed cancer diagnosis). Similarly, a negligent adverse event refers to substandard medical or surgical management to the level that the legal criteria for negligence are met, which causes patient harm.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r5">[5]</xref></p>

        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p><bold>Near miss event</bold>: A medical error that could have resulted in patient harm but did not due to intervention or chance is identified as a <italic toggle="yes">near miss</italic>. Near misses are identical to adverse events except that a patient harm outcome does not occur. Therefore, near misses provide opportunities for developing preventive strategies and actions and should receive the same scrutiny as adverse events.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r1">[1]</xref></p>

          <list-item>
            <p><bold>Potentially compensatable event</bold>: An adverse event (eg, disability and prolonged hospitalization) that could lead to malpractice claims is referred to as a potentially compensatable event.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r5">[5]</xref></p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <list list-type="bullet">

          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>
<bold>Analyzing Root Causes and Sentinel Events</bold>
</p>
        <p>A deficiency or decision that, if corrected or avoided, would eliminate the adverse event is referred to as a <italic toggle="yes">root cause</italic>. Several factors may often contribute to a preventable outcome of patient harm. The most common types of root causes include human error (eg, deficiencies in education, incomplete assessments, misdiagnosis), communication issues (eg, failure to disclose problems, inadequate patient counseling, failure to obtain informed consent), and organizational process deficiencies (eg, inadequate methods of identifying patients, equipment failures, lack of organizational protocols, or poor staffing and supervision).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r12">[12]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r13">[13]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Furthermore, a <italic toggle="yes">sentinel event</italic>&#x000a0;is defined by the Joint Commission as any unexpected adverse event "involving death, serious physical or psychological injury, or the risk thereof. The phrase 'or the risk thereof' includes any process variation for which a recurrence would carry a significant chance of a serious adverse outcome." Sentinel events indicate the need for an immediate investigation to discover the cause and develop corrective measures. Moreover, the Joint Commission&#x000a0;reviews all sentinel events that have resulted in unexpected mortality,&#x000a0;significant permanent harm, or severe, temporary harm requiring intervention to sustain life, which they&#x000a0;require all member healthcare agencies to report.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r14">[14]</xref>&#x000a0;Sentinel events include:</p>

Members of the RCA team focus primarily on systems and processes, not individual actions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r13">[13]</xref>&#x000a0;For instance, when a hospital conducts a root cause investigation of a patient allergic to erythromycin who developed an acute anaphylaxis reaction after being prescribed azithromycin, an action plan to educate the entire medical staff on drug-drug interactions and similarities may be developed. Furthermore, an electronic medical record "stop alert" may be implemented to prevent this error from reoccurring. The Joint Commission is then provided this report, which is aggregated with all other RCA reports, and a risk-reduction strategy is published in the "Sentinel Event Alert" newsletter. Healthcare agencies failing to perform an RCA are placed on an "accreditation watch" by the Joint Commission, a public disclosure that a sentinel event occurred without completing an acceptable action plan. When a sentinel event threatens patient health and safety, the Joint Commission conducts onsite reviews.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r13">[13]</xref></p>

Subsequently, individuals involved in every aspect of healthcare can help implement appropriate preventative strategies to reduce future medical errors and improve patient safety.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r15">[15]</xref>&#x000a0;Common types of medical errors being studied include surgical errors, diagnostic errors, medication errors, equipment failures, patient falls, hospital-acquired infections, and communication failures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r12">[12]</xref></p>

<bold>Surgical Errors</bold>
</p>
        <p>Errors in surgery have the highest risk of severe patient injury and death. Intraoperative errors are estimated to be the primary issue in 75% of malpractice cases involving surgeons. Surgical errors involving the wrong site, patient, or procedure should never occur. Investigations into the factors that led to these types of surgical errors have demonstrated that common causes include clinician factors (eg, feeling rushed, distractions, and fatigue), miscommunication, changing or inadequate staffing, organizational factors (eg, discarding specimens as waste and not labeling specimens), medical record issues, and cognitive errors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r17">[17]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Prevention measures have frequently consisted of adopting checklists,&#x000a0;counting instruments, initiating antithrombotic prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, and utilizing radio-frequency marked sponges.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Additionally, the performance of a surgical time-out has become a widespread strategy to reduce surgical errors. A time-out is a pause before a surgical procedure begins. The surgical team pauses and reviews the patient's identity, the consent form, the procedure&#x000a0;being performed, and the correct anatomical structures and side involved, which should be marked on the patient's skin. If multiple procedures by separate surgical teams are planned, separate time-outs must be done. Surgeons and every surgical team member involved in the procedure must be present during the time-out, and any disagreement during the time-out should trigger an investigation by the surgical team until the discrepancy is resolved.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r18">[18]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Diagnostic Errors</bold>
</p>
        <p>The National Academy of Medicine defines a diagnostic error as "the failure to establish an accurate and timely explanation of a patient's health problems or to communicate that explanation to the patient," therefore, delayed or missed diagnoses are considered errors as well.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r19">[19]</xref> According to the Joint Commission, diagnostic errors result in the death or injury of 40,000 to 80,000 patients annually. Diagnostic errors are most common in primary care solo practices due to workload, time constraints, and the inability to confer easily with colleagues.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r20">[20]</xref> One study estimated that 12 million patients in the US had a diagnostic error made during their care, with 33% of those errors resulting in patient injury.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r21">[21]</xref> Conversely, patients seen in teaching medical institutions have many clinicians (eg, attendings, residents, fellows, and medical students), decreasing the chance of diagnostic error.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r22">[22]</xref>&#x000a0;Diagnostic errors cause adverse events for approximately 5% of outpatients and 17% of hospitalized patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r20">[20]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>

Identifying these commonly misdiagnosed conditions is beneficial, as diagnostic errors are primarily cognitive rather than organization-based errors; therefore, clinicians can be forewarned of the potential challenges when caring for these patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r25">[25]</xref>&#x000a0;In addition to a clinical knowledge deficiency, common contributing factors to diagnostic error include a clinician's fatigue, distraction, failure to consider differential diagnoses, neglect of diagnostic testing follow-up, and inadequate patient follow-up care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r20">[20]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Reducing diagnostic errors requires a comprehensive approach that implements various strategies due to the many factors that can lead to these errors.&#x000a0;System-based safety checks and cognitive aids are often recommended as interventions to help prevent diagnostic errors. Cognitive aids include algorithms to help guide decision-making based on accepted guidelines, "trigger tools" within&#x000a0;electronic health records that remind clinicians to consider differential diagnoses for commonly misdiagnosed conditions, and checklists to prevent the omission of critical steps.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r26">[26]</xref>&#x000a0;The use of cognitive aids and trigger tools has been shown to decrease the rate of misdiagnoses in recent studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r26">[26]</xref>&#x000a0;Addressing deficiencies through various other strategies (eg, device-based decision support, simulation-based training, and increased specialist utilization) may also help reduce diagnostic errors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r21">[21]</xref>&#x000a0;Though ingrained practice methods and physician overconfidence can attenuate the success of these interventions, fostering critical thinking and promoting "pause and reflect" methods have been found to help avert diagnostic errors, especially in cases with obscure clinical findings or unexpected clinical trajectories.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r27">[27]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r25">[25]</xref>&#x000a0;Aside from encouraging critical thinking, opportunities for case discussions and second opinions should be made available for the treating providers.

        <p>
<bold>Medication Errors</bold>
</p>
        <p>Because there are several components involved with patient medications (eg, prescribing, dispensing, dosing, and administering), errors can occur in any of those areas. However, many medication errors are considered preventable.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r28">[28]</xref>&#x000a0;Common medication errors include overriding medication-use safeguards, mistakenly administering a similar-sounding medication, or using out-of-date medications.&#x000a0;System changes that can help decrease medication errors include computerized provider order entry (CPOE), barcoding systems to identify patients and medications, standardized units of measure, weight-based dosing, and having a pharmacist available to assist with calculating the correct dose. Furthermore, rechecking medication names and dosing before administration is critical to avoid preventable medication errors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>Barcode administration and handheld personal digital assistants increase medication administration safety by providing real-time patient information, medication profiles, laboratory values, drug information, and documentation. Moreover, electronic medication administration helps identify incorrect medications and orders that have been canceled or modified. However, circumventing barcode procedures decreases safety at the point of care. Automatic dispensing systems that quickly make drugs available to patients allow pharmacy clinicians to engage in other safety activities, such as medication reconciliation. Additionally,&#x000a0;look-alike medications should be stored away from more dangerous&#x000a0;medications. Hospitals can also standardize storage areas and avoid medication containers that have a similar appearance. Pharmacy clinicians should remove dangerous medications&#x000a0;from floor stock and discard out-of-date drugs as a preventative measure. Other strategies include using color-coded intravenous lines, utilizing standard concentrations of vasoactive agents, labeling syringes immediately after preparation, and capitalizing the differences on the labels of medications with similar names.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r3">[3]</xref></p>

<bold>Device and Equipment Errors</bold>
</p>
        <p>Health professionals generally believe technology will improve healthcare efficiency, lower cost, increase quality, and promote safety; however, these same technologies may also introduce errors and adverse events. Millions of healthcare providers use approximately 5000 types of medical devices worldwide, so device-related errors are inevitable.&#x000a0;Medical equipment design flaws, mishandling, user error, and malfunction are common causes of medical errors. Additionally, a significant number of medical devices have been implanted in patients (eg, pacemakers, defibrillators, and nerve and brain stimulators), which may malfunction and result in life-threatening complications. Equipment errors can be due to device differences between manufacturers, inadequate testing and maintenance, poor design, and poor maintenance.&#x000a0;Errors involving tube and catheter connections (eg, using catheters for unintended purposes, running the wrong line through a pump, and misplacing feeding tubes into the lung) are also common. These adverse events can have life-threatening effects if a misconnection is not corrected early.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r29">[29]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r30">[30]</xref>&#x000a0;To complicate the situation further, medications and food supplements are often delivered via these routes, and placement errors can result in administration or omission mistakes.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Health professionals should be involved in setting and evaluating institutional, organizational, and public technology-related policies. Safety primarily can be improved by developing&#x000a0;protocols for equipment maintenance, training, monitoring, and reporting adverse events related to technology. Additionally, clinicians should be educated in remaining vigilant despite clinical assistance by devices and able to manage equipment failure situations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r31">[31]</xref>&#x000a0;Unique connectors for anesthesia catheters&#x000a0;and feeding tubes can be used to reduce the chances of tubing misconnections.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r32">[32]</xref>&#x000a0;Furthermore, clinicians and support staff should always trace lines back to the origin before connecting or disconnecting devices or starting infusions and labeling high-risk catheters.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r29">[29]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r30">[30]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Hospital-Acquired Infection</bold>
</p>
        <p>Healthcare-related infections are considered a failure of the system. As many as 1 in 20 hospitalized patients may acquire a healthcare-related infection, increasing complications and the length and cost of the hospital stay. Healthcare-related infections add close to $35 billion to the annual cost of healthcare in the United States.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r33">[33]</xref>&#x000a0;Common causes of hospital-acquired infections include failure to practice basic hand hygiene and poor technique in placing indwelling urinary and vascular catheters.

        <p>Changing the behaviors of healthcare team members is effective in reducing iatrogenic infections.

        <p>
<bold>Communication</bold>
</p>
        <p>Optimal interprofessional communication, as well as with patients, is essential for patient care. Therefore, communication errors commonly result in adverse events.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r39">[39]</xref>&#x000a0;Reasons for impaired communication include disruptive patient behavior, environmental distractions (eg, cell phones and pagers), cultural&#x000a0;differences, hierarchy issues, personality differences, language barriers, and socioeconomic variables, such as education and literacy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>A courteous and respectful workplace where the interprofessional team collaborates promotes a safe work environment for all healthcare team members, families, and patients. Risk management committees and interprofessional task forces should&#x000a0;work collaboratively on risk assessment and reduction. Joint education programs help providers and support staff learn roles and develop relationships to improve safety.&#x000a0;The Joint Commission's Safety Goals require that for critical test results and verbal or telephone orders, a "read-back" verbatim to the practitioner by the person receiving and recording the result or order. The practitioner should then verbally acknowledge the accuracy of the order.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>Additionally, healthcare staff should avoid common errors in written communication, such as using nonstandard abbreviations, illegible handwriting, failure to question inappropriately written orders, and failure to complete correct specimen labeling. Therefore, staff should be encouraged to ask questions when uncertain and trained to double-check that the patient's name is spelled correctly and their correct date of birth is present.&#x000a0;The Joint Commission requires healthcare professionals to use 2 or more patient identifiers when labeling, delivering, and maintaining specimens. Since this is a National Patient Safety Goal, The Joint Commission closely monitors healthcare institutions' adherence to this requirement as they prepare medications and transfusions and transfer patients from unit to unit.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>Clinicians should also follow well-communicated protocols that guide care and communication with patients. Providers should&#x000a0;listen to patients' questions concerning how care is delivered. Concerns must be respected and accepted if care plans contradict established evidence-based medicine. Moreover, the Joint Commission has supported "speak up" initiatives, which encourage hospitals to inform patients about the importance of their contributions to the care they receive in preventing medical errors. To make patients active participants in avoiding medical errors, encourage patients to ask about unfamiliar tests, unplanned diagnostic tests, and medications and to verify the correct surgical site.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Implementing standardized clinician-family communication at the patient bedside with family engagement and bidirectional communication also decreased the frequency of harmful medical errors and positively impacted the family experience.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r40">[40]</xref></p>
        <p>Communication errors during patient hand-offs can occur when&#x000a0;incorrect information is passed to the receiving clinician or pertinent information is omitted.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r41">[41]</xref>&#x000a0;Several techniques developed to minimize errors when handing off patients include using electronic records and mnemonics (eg, situation, background, assessment, and recommendation [SBAR])&#x000a0;to address all pertinent information.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r42">[42]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r43">[43]</xref>&#x000a0;The SBAR tool is considered a best-practice communication technique to deliver information in an organized and logical fashion during hand-off and critical patient care situations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r43">[43]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>

        <title>Clinical Significance</title>
        <p>Medical error is a common cause of injury or death in the United States. Health professionals work hard to save countless lives; however, the incidence of concomitant error is high. All health professions should be focused on the effort to "do no harm" and work towards decreasing human and system errors. Most medical errors do not occur solely as the result of one practitioner or a group of practitioners; most are due to systems or process failures that lead to mistakes such as keeping dangerous and routine medications together without pharmacist supervision or&#x000a0;cost-control measures that increase workload and the rate of medical errors.</p>
        <p>Errors can be prevented by modifying processes to make performing incorrect actions more difficult, such as utilizing electronic systems for various aspects of patient care. However, system and process changes can not be made unless problems are identified. Through reporting protocols, medical error pattern recognition, root cause analysis, and outcome monitoring can be performed to address institutional deficiencies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;However, healthcare professionals may be reluctant to report errors due to fear of punishment or legal consequences. While individuals need to be held accountable for individual mistakes, the system and culture must be revised so that reporting errors leads to system improvement, not individual punishment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r45">[45]</xref></p>
        <p>The greatest good for the greatest number of patients is achieved when processes are constantly focused on quality improvement and avoiding repetition of the same error. While they desire increased patient safety, healthcare professionals and other staff may fear reporting an incident may result in disciplinary action, including losing their jobs. Though failing to report medical errors contributes to the likelihood of severe patient harm, many healthcare institutions have rigid policies that create an adversarial environment. This can cause staff to be hesitant to report errors, minimize problems, or fail to document problematic issues, contributing to an evolving cycle of medical errors and eventually tarnishing a healthcare institution's reputation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Therefore, an essential first step in reducing medical errors is encouraging reporting by removing&#x000a0;any reporting barriers so that adverse events and near misses are identified. The most common barrier to medical error reporting is a fear of consequences.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r46">[46]</xref>&#x000a0;Implementation of confidential reporting options is critical to the success of a reporting system to overcome any hesitancy an individual may have.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r1">[1]</xref> Furthermore, changing workplace culture, in addition to developing protocols for&#x000a0;addressing medical errors, can encourage medical error reporting. Adopting a patient safety culture, where clinicians are empowered and rewarded for identifying medical errors that could lead to patient harm, has been shown to overcome the fear of consequences. Consequently, patient safety is improved by institutional cultures that incorporate both training and improvement efforts that target system redesign and an environment where individuals feel safe from retribution. All individuals on the healthcare team must play a role in making healthcare safer for patients and healthcare workers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r47">[47]</xref></p>

The IOM also recommended limiting direct patient care nursing to 60 hours every 7 days.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r50">[50]</xref></p>
        <p>Other interventions recommended by the IOM focus on establishing a work environment that allows for easy monitoring of patients, limits interruptions, and minimizes clerical tasks. Special education and training should be provided for error-prone tasks such as medication administration, patient hand-offs, and supervising trainees.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r50">[50]</xref>&#x000a0;The latter is essential to promote an ongoing culture of patient safety and error-free medication administration. A recent study surveying nursing students regarding their perception of medical errors committed during direct patient care reported that "less knowledge" about the task or procedure and "lack of supervision" were the primary causes of medical errors they committed during training.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r51">[51]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>An overall commitment to patient safety at the organizational level greatly influences a nurse's adherence to and compliance with patient safety principles. Creating an organizational patient-safety climate, managing workload, reducing time pressure, and providing education for improving knowledge and skills enhances their adherence to patient-safety principles.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r52">[52]</xref>&#x000a0;Close monitoring for medical errors, near misses, and nurse fatigue should follow the implementation of patient safety interventions, as nonpunitive, focused, and effective feedback can improve patient safety adherence and clinical outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r49">[49]</xref></p>
        <p>Additionally, emphasis should be given to individuals who require&#x000a0;personal motivation, resist change, or are averse to innovation. These individuals need empowerment and a nonjudgmental approach in their training toward patient safety practices. Improving knowledge regarding patient care tasks and the breadth of medical errors that&#x000a0;can be prevented with adherence to patient safety principles has been shown to enhance their commitment to patient safety.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-40659.r52">[52]</xref></p>
