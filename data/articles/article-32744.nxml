        <p>Dermatoses of pregnancy are a heterogeneous and distinct group of skin disorders that are specific to the pregnancy and postpartum periods. These dermatoses occur due to an interaction of multiple factors in the body and skin during pregnancy. The dermatoses specific to pregnancy include pemphigoid gestationis, polymorphic eruption of pregnancy, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, pustular psoriasis of pregnancy, and atopic eruption of pregnancy. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of dermatoses of pregnancy and identifies the role of the interprofessional team in managing these conditions.</p>
        <p>Participants will gain invaluable insights into the broader implications of these dermatoses, acknowledging their potential impact on both maternal and fetal health. With a focus on addressing distressing symptoms, notably severe itching, this CME activity emphasizes a holistic approach, dissecting the interplay of various factors within the body and skin during pregnancy. Participants will emerge equipped not only with enhanced diagnostic and treatment skills but also a heightened awareness of the collaborative role of the interprofessional team in effectively managing these complex dermatological conditions.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Three main factors cause skin changes commonly seen in pregnancy. These changes include an increase in hormone levels, intravascular volume expansion, and skin compression from the pregnant uterus. Melasma, venous congestion, varicosities, spider telangiectasias, palmar erythema, cutis marmorata, acrochordons, and striae are common skin changes seen during pregnancy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r1">[1]</xref> However, there are several&#x000a0;pathological dermatoses&#x000a0;that are specific to pregnancy.

        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p><bold>Pemphigoid gestationis (PG)</bold> involves the formation of autoantibodies against bullous pemphigoid antigens 180 and 230.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;The disease process begins with&#x000a0;an immune response within the placenta, where abnormal expression of antigens occurs. This stimulates maternal antibody production to the abnormal placental antigens. These antibodies bind not only to the placental antigen but also to the antigen in the basement membrane of the skin. The inflammatory cascade of the skin is subsequently activated, causing the splitting of the epidermis and dermis. Tense bullae are formed on the skin, which is a distinct feature of pemphigoid gestationis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy (PEP) </bold>is the updated name of the pregnancy dermatosis formerly called pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP) in the United States.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r6">[6]</xref> It commonly begins in the abdominal striae. Although the etiology is poorly understood, it has been suggested that damage to the underlying collagen connective tissue of the skin from abdominal distention may play a role in developing this pregnancy-specific dermatosis. An inflammatory response is activated&#x000a0;in the skin of the abdomen, which may spread to the collagen of the skin in other areas of the body.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Frequently, PEP is seen in women with multiple gestations or who have gained large amounts of weight during pregnancy. Another proposed etiology is a maternal immune response to fetal antigens in the maternal blood.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy&#x000a0;(ICP)&#x000a0;</bold>is caused by the buildup of bile salts within the cells of the liver. This results in elevated levels of bile salts in the blood. The underlying cause of this phenomenon during pregnancy is poorly understood.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;It is likely due to a combination of genetic, environmental, and endocrine factors. Mutations in biliary transporters could play a genetic role in the etiology of cholestasis. Potential environmental factors include low vitamin D levels and low dietary intake of selenium, as noted by an increased incidence of cholestasis of pregnancy in the winter months. Endocrine factors include elevated levels of estrogen and progesterone metabolites during pregnancy, which can disrupt the influx and efflux of bile acids from liver cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Atopic eruption of pregnancy (AEP)</bold> is usually seen in pregnant women with a history of atopy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;It most likely occurs due to a change in the maternal immune response during pregnancy, including the downregulation of T-helper 1 cytokine production and cell-mediated immune function. There is an increase in T-helper 2 cytokine production and humoral immune response. This shift in the immune response, which is specific to pregnancy, exacerbates the imbalance already seen in people with atopy, resulting in the itching and skin lesions seen with atopic eruption of pregnancy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r10">[10]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Pustular psoriasis of pregnancy (PPP),&#x000a0;</bold>also known as impetigo herpetiformus, is likely a variant of pustular psoriasis seen outside of pregnancy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref></p>

        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>Dermatoses of pregnancy are skin conditions seen in reproductive-aged&#x000a0;females throughout the world.</p>
        <p><bold>Pemphigoid gestationis (PG)</bold> is a rare skin disease of pregnancy. The incidence of pemphigoid gestationis is 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 60,000 pregnancies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref> The most significant risk factor for PG is having it in a previous pregnancy.</p>
        <p><bold>Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy</bold>
<bold>(PEP)</bold> affects 1 in 200 pregnancies and typically occurs in the third trimester and in primigravid women. It is a self-limiting skin dermatosis that may also present postpartum. It is seen more commonly when the fetus is male. Seventy-five percent&#x000a0;of women with PEP are primiparous.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy</bold>
<bold>(ICP)</bold> is seen in varying frequencies based on patient population. Araucanian Indian women, indigenous to the South American country of Chili,&#x000a0;have the highest incidence at 28%. In Europe, the incidence is 1.5% or less. In the United States, the incidence is as low as 0.32% in white populations to as high as 5.6% in&#x000a0;Hispanic groups.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Risk factors for developing ICP include personal or family history of ICP, hepatobiliary disease, and advanced maternal age. Risks for severe disease include smoking, previous cholecystectomy, history of ICP in an earlier pregnancy, and pregestational diabetes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r11">[11]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Atopic eruption of pregnancy</bold>
<bold>(AEP)</bold> is the most common skin disorder seen in pregnancy, accounting for half of all dermatoses. Most cases present early in pregnancy, in the first trimester. In 75% of patients, AEP begins before the third trimester, which is earlier in pregnancy than the other dermatoses specific to pregnancy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p><bold>Pustular psoriasis of pregnancy</bold>&#x000a0;<bold>(PPP)</bold> or impetigo herpetiformus is a very rare dermatosis of pregnancy that is seen most commonly in third-trimester patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;It frequently occurs in primigravidas.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r1">[1]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-32744.s5" sec-type="Pathophysiology">
        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p><bold>Pemphigoid gestationis</bold>&#x000a0;<bold>(PG)</bold> is an autoimmune disease similar to bullous pemphigoid. It may rarely occur with hydatiform moles or choriocarcinoma. The immune response begins in the placenta and stimulates maternal antibody production. These antibodies to the placenta then cross-react with antigens in the skin. Autoantibodies react with collagen XVII in the skin, causing splitting of the dermis and epidermis resulting in tense bullae formation. Initially, bullae form in the periumbilical region but then spread to other parts of the trunk and extremities. Itching is very common. PG develops most commonly (34% of the time) in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. However, it may occur in the first trimester 18% of the time and postpartum 14% of the time. The skin lesions frequently resolve in the last few weeks of pregnancy. However, 10% of women have a recurrence of lesions with the use of oral contraceptives, and 75% of women have recurrences postpartum.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p><bold>Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy</bold>&#x000a0;<bold>(PEP)</bold> is usually seen in primiparous patients in the last trimester or sometimes in the second trimester of pregnancy. The lesions first appear as pruritic, erythematous papules and plaques that begin in the abdominal striae and may later spread to the skin of the breasts, back, arms, or thighs. Sparing of the periumbilical area as well as the face, soles of feet, and palms of hands is characteristic.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Recurrence in subsequent pregnancies is rare.&#x000a0;Only about 15% of cases&#x000a0;begin in the postpartum time frame.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r13">[13]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy</bold>&#x000a0;<bold>(ICP)</bold>&#x000a0;starts as pruritus without any primary skin lesions. Typical itching occurs on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Secondary skin lesions like linear excoriations, erosions, and scabbing may be present. It frequently recurs during subsequent pregnancies in 45% to 70% of cases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Atopic eruption of pregnancy&#x000a0;(AEP)</bold> includes&#x000a0;a variety of dermatoses that have been placed in a category together due to shared clinical features. In atopic eczema, the eczematous lesions appear for the first time during pregnancy. They usually occur during the first or second trimester. In the majority, lesions are in flexures&#x000a0;or atopic sites. In the remaining, about one-third of the lesions are distributed on the trunk and limbs. In prurigo of pregnancy, groups of excoriated papules are seen on the limbs and trunk. In pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy, occurring in the&#x000a0;second or third trimester, erythematous follicular papules resembling steroid-induced acne are seen.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r14">[14]</xref>&#x000a0;The pathophysiology may be due to an exaggerated shift in the immune response, which normally occurs in pregnancy to prevent fetal rejection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Pustular psoriasis of pregnancy&#x000a0;(PPP)</bold> may be caused by underlying hypocalcemia, low vitamin D, hyperparathyroidism, genetic variations, or hormonal changes. The underlying&#x000a0;pathophysiology is overall poorly understood.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref></p>

        <title>Histopathology</title>
        <p><bold>Pemphigoid gestationis (PG)</bold>&#x000a0;is characterized by eosinophilic spongiosis, eosinophilic epitheliotropism, and dense superficial dermal eosinophils. It is confirmed by histopathology&#x000a0;of a skin biopsy and direct immunofluorescence staining.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p><bold>Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy (PEP)</bold>&#x000a0;has non-specific histopathology findings. It variably shows scattered stromal mast cells, polymorphous mononuclear infiltrates with eosinophils, and dermal edema. Histology may manifest with superficial and deep perivascular mononuclear cells with eosinophils in half of cases. In approximately one-third of biopsies, parakeratosis, focal spongiosis, and acanthosis may be seen in the epidermis. Direct immunofluorescence is consistently negative.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Superficial or deep perivascular dermatitis and lymphocytic vasculitis may be present. In some cases, nuclear dust may be noted, but no fibrin extravasation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r6">[6]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy&#x000a0;(ICP)</bold> shows abnormal placental histopathology, including increased terminal villous and capillary surface area, increase in the number of syncytial knots, as well as decidual arteriopathy, delayed villous maturation, choriangiosis, and decidual arteriopathy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r15">[15]</xref> There are no primary skin&#x000a0;lesions with ICP.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p><bold>Atopic eruption of pregnancy (AEP)</bold>&#x000a0;shows subepidermal pustules and perifollicular neutrophilic infiltration on microscopic examination.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;Epidermal hyperplasia, spongiosis, and parakeratosis may be seen in the skin on histopathology.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r6">[6]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Pustular psoriasis of pregnancy (PPP)</bold>&#x000a0;is usually diagnosed by clinical findings rather than microscopic exams. Multiple tender and sterile pustules are noted on the skin. Blotchy erythema is found underneath these pustules. If biopsied, histopathology shows neutrophilic infiltrates in the dermis and micropustules in the epidermis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r16">[16]</xref></p>

        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>When a new rash occurs during pregnancy, a diagnosis&#x000a0;must be made to alert the patient and clinician of potential risks to the mother or fetus. A medical history, including personal and family history as well as obstetrical history, is important since some dermatoses of pregnancy recur in subsequent pregnancies. Specifics about the onset and particular symptoms are important, as well as a detailed skin exam and possibly a skin biopsy. Laboratory evaluations may be needed based on the clinical and history findings.</p>
        <p><bold>Pemphigoid gestationis (PG)</bold> usually develops in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. The main symptom is severe itching. Skin papules and plaques on the abdomen and back are characteristic. The&#x000a0;urticarial papules, plaques, and vesicles appear first in the periumbilical region. Spread to the truck and extremities may occur later, but the face and mucous membranes are typically spared. The initial skin rash turns into vesicles or tense bullae on an erythematous base, with the&#x000a0;time between initial rash formation and bullae formation&#x000a0;being days to up to 4 weeks. The bullae that develop during pregnancy&#x000a0;typically regress spontaneously in the final weeks of pregnancy,&#x000a0;before delivery. However, many patients develop flares immediately postpartum. PG may recur during subsequent pregnancies, and about 10 percent of cases will recur while patients take oral contraceptives.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy&#x000a0;(PEP)&#x000a0;</bold>is&#x000a0;usually present&#x000a0;during the third trimester. Urticarial lesions involve the abdominal striae. PEP spares the periumbilical area. The erythematous lesions may be surrounded by pale halos, forming target-like lesions. It is the most&#x000a0;frequent pregnancy dermatosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r14">[14]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p><bold>Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP)</bold> presents as generalized pruritus in the late second or third trimester, frequently starting on the palms and soles. The itching is worse at night. There are no visible primary skin lesions. Secondary lesions like excoriations, erosions, and scabbing are seen. Jaundice, pale stools, and steatorrhea may or may not be present. ICP may recur during subsequent pregnancies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Atopic eruption of pregnancy (AEP)</bold>&#x000a0;is associated with intense itching. It usually presents in the first or second trimester of pregnancy. It is a clinical diagnosis that is confirmed by ruling out other diagnoses. There are P-type and E-type of skin eruptions. P-type are commonly erythematous groups of small papules or lesions on the extensor surfaces of the extremities and on the trunk. E-type lesions are eczematous lesions that often involve the face, neck, upper chest, and flexural aspects of the extremities, which are common areas affected by eczema. Frequently, patients have a personal or family history of atopy, asthma, or seasonal allergies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Pustular psoriasis of pregnancy (PPP)</bold> or impetigo herpetiformis is a rare finding in pregnancy, but when it occurs, it is frequently&#x000a0;seen in the third trimester of pregnancy when circumferential rings of erythematous plaques covered with sterile pustules along the periphery occur in flexural areas. The lesions do not typically itch. These plaques may spread to the trunk and extremities. Hands, feet, and face are generally spared. The plaques may become centrally crusted and eroded. This is a rare disorder of pregnancy but&#x000a0;systemic symptoms may be associated, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, anorexia, lymphadenopathy malaise, and even seizures. Onycholysis may result. The plaques then spread to involve the trunk and extremities, often sparring the hands, feet, and face.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref></p>

        <p><bold>Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy (PEP)</bold> is usually diagnosed based on the clinical presentation and history. Rarely a skin biopsy is needed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;No bullae are noted on the skin with PEP.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r17">[17]</xref></p>
        <p>PG and PEP can be difficult to distinguish clinically, as they both involve urticated papules and plaques. It is important to evaluate and differentiate between these&#x000a0;2 dermatoses of pregnancy, however, because PEP is not associated with pregnancy complications, but PG may be associated with placental insufficiency. In areas of the world where direct immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunoassays are not available, a scoring system for differentiating PG and PEP may be helpful.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r17">[17]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP)</bold> is associated with elevated serum total bile acid&#x000a0;levels &#x0003e;11 micromoles/L. If bile acids are &#x0003e;40 micromoles/L, the disease is considered severe. Direct or indirect bilirubin and liver transaminases may be elevated. Ultrasound of the liver may help exclude other causes of transaminitis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Atopic eruption of pregnancy</bold>&#x000a0;<bold>(AEP)</bold> is a diagnosis usually made by clinical presentation; however, a skin biopsy may be used to rule out other conditions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;There are no reliable diagnostic criteria for AEP.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r12">[12]</xref></p>

        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p><bold>Pemphigoid gestationis (PG):</bold> The main goals of treatment are to minimize itching and decrease blister formation. The first-line treatment is topical steroids such as fluocinonide 0.05% cream or ointment or clobetasol propionate 0.05% cream or ointment. Oral antihistamines, like 10 mg of loratadine daily, may help treat itching. Systemic corticosteroids may be necessary if topical therapy does not achieve an adequate response. Intravenous immune globulin, azathioprine, and dapsone have also been used as therapy. Rituximab has been used for the treatment of postpartum flares.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy (PEP):</bold> The main goal of treatment is to decrease itching. The lesions frequently resolve on their own in 4 to 6 weeks. Oral antihistamines and topical steroids are commonly used for treatment. Topical hydrocortisone 2.5% ointment or cream, desonide 0.05% ointment or cream, triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% ointment or cream, mometasone furoate 0.1% cream, or fluocinolone acetonide 0.025% ointment may be used. Systemic corticosteroids may be used as a short course if topical treatment is not satisfactory. Common regimens include prednisolone or prednisone 0.5 mg/kg daily for a week, followed by a taper over the subsequent 1 to 2 weeks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP):</bold> Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is currently&#x000a0;the most effective pharmacologic treatment for&#x000a0;ICP and has the most benefits. However, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine states that UDCA therapy does not improve fetal outcomes with ICP. It significantly improves maternal pruritis. A starting dose of UDCA of 10 mg/kg to 15 mg/kg per day can be divided into&#x000a0;2 or&#x000a0;3 daily doses. After&#x000a0;1 week, the dose can be increased to a maximum of 21 mg/kg per day to control symptoms. A dose in the range of 450 mg/day to 1200 mg/day reduces total bile acids in cord blood, colostrum, and amniotic fluid.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r19">[19]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Alternative treatment options include oral antihistamines, S-adenosyl-l-methionine, and rifampin. Cholestyramine has a high side-effect profile and does not improve itching but does reduce bile acid resorption.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Delivery is recommended at 36 weeks gestation when bile acid levels are&#x000a0;<bold>&#x02265;</bold>100 micromoles/L due to&#x000a0;the increased risk of stillbirth. Delivery between 36 and 39 weeks of gestation is recommended when bile acid levels are &#x0003c;100 micromoles/L.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Atopic eruption of pregnancy (AEP):</bold> Topical therapies to improve itching and relieve dryness, including urea and 1% to 2% menthol, are initial treatment recommendations. Adequate skin hydration is critical as fundamental therapy. Antihistamines such as chlorpheniramine, loratadine, and cetraizine may also be used.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Topical&#x000a0;medium to high potency steroids in the amount of 200 mg/month are considered safe in pregnancy. Fluticasone propionate should not be used in pregnancy because the placenta does not metabolize it and can, therefore, reach the fetus in higher concentrations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r12">[12]</xref> Oral corticosteroids may be needed when initial treatment is not successful. Prednisone or prednisolone at a maximum dose of 0.5 mg/kg/d for&#x000a0;2 to 3 weeks may be necessary to control symptoms. Broad and narrowband UVB and UVA-1 light therapy have also been utilized.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;Cyclosporin A and azathioprine (off-label use) may be used in pregnancy when the benefits to the mother are deemed to outweigh any potential risk to the fetus. Methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil use are contraindicated during pregnancy. Janus kinase inhibitors, baricitinib, upadacitinib, and abrocitinib are also contraindicated for use in pregnancy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r12">[12]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p><bold>Pustular psoriasis of pregnancy (PPP):</bold> Prednisolone 15&#x000a0;mg to 30 mg daily, a systemic corticosteroid, is the most common treatment for PPP. The dose may be increased to prednisolone 60 mg to 80 mg daily if needed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0; Topical betamethasone 0.05%&#x000a0;at a dose of 15 g/day to 30 g/day has also been used. Dapsone, H1-receptor antagonists, and colchicine have been tried. Acitretin has been successfully used in postpartum women.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r18">[18]</xref>&#x000a0;Cyclosporine or tumor necrosis inhibitors, infliximab&#x000a0;and adalimumab, may be&#x000a0;used in very severe cases. Several other medications have been used in pregnancy to treat PPP, but since this disease is so rare, there is limited data on the efficacy and safety in pregnancy. Delivery is curative, so this may be considered, especially when close to term and with refractory disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-32744.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>

        <title>Deterrence and Patient Education</title>
        <p>The first steps in achieving the best possible outcome in patients with specific dermatoses of pregnancy are recognition, correct diagnosis, and adequate treatment of symptoms. Improving symptoms, as well as providing education to patients regarding the specific diagnosis, will lead to better outcomes for patients affected by the dermatoses specific to pregnancy. A consultation with a dermatologist may provide an additional expert evaluation to optimize treatment strategies and outcomes. Proper treatment strategies are crucial to reduce and prevent disruptive itching and potential adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. Patient education about the risk of recurrence in future pregnancies will help with family planning decisions.</p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>&#x000a0;Healthcare professionals involved in managing dermatoses of pregnancy should possess diagnostic skills to accurately identify both common physiological skin changes and specific pathological dermatoses related to pregnancy. Competence in treatment selection, considering the unique challenges of pregnancy, is crucial. Skills in patient education are essential, ensuring individuals understand their conditions, treatment plans, and potential implications for both maternal and fetal well-being.&#x000a0;The primary care physician, advanced care practitioner, nurse midwife, and&#x000a0;obstetrician should seek consultation from a maternal-fetal medicine specialist or dermatologist&#x000a0;if diagnoses and recommendations on treatment are not straightforward or successful.</p>
        <p>Developing a comprehensive strategy involves a collaborative and multidisciplinary approach.&#x000a0;Physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and other health professionals share responsibilities in delivering patient-centered care. This includes the formulation of evidence-based protocols for evaluating and treating dermatoses of pregnancy.&#x000a0;Ensuring patient safety is paramount, and&#x000a0;interprofessional team members should identify and mitigate potential risks associated with dermatoses and their treatments during pregnancy.</p>
        <p>Establishing clear communication channels contributes to a cohesive strategy. Regular case discussions and multidisciplinary meetings enhance understanding and coordination, leading to more holistic and patient-centered care. Continuous education and training programs can further refine strategies, keeping&#x000a0;clinicians updated on the latest advancements in managing these dermatological conditions.&#x000a0;Coordinated efforts contribute to improved patient outcomes, reduced healthcare disparities, and enhanced overall healthcare experiences for individuals&#x000a0;affected with dermatoses of pregnancy.</p>
