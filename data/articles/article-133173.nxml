        <p>Prompt differentiation of EAH from other exertional illnesses is critical, as isotonic fluid administration that may be given for other exertional diagnoses can worsen EAH, resulting in life-threatening sequelae of hyponatremia. EAH is treated with fluid restriction or sodium replacement, depending upon severity. Avoiding overhydration can prevent EAH. Athletes, coaches, healthcare providers, and athletic event staff must be educated on EAH prevention strategies and presenting symptoms to decrease athletes&#x02019; risk of development and progression to hyponatremic encephalopathy, coma, or death.</p>

        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>EAH develops due to increased total body free water relative to total body sodium via two major mechanisms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Firstly, before and during strenuous physical activity, athletes often increase their intake of hypotonic fluids such as water and sports drinks due to conditioned behaviors, leading to increased total body water. Secondly, physical exertion itself may result in inappropriate non-osmotic antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion, leading to free water retention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r4">[4]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-133173.s4" sec-type="Epidemiology">
        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>EAH occurs in a wide variety of athletes in activities of various intensities, including ultramarathon and marathon running, triathlon, shorter distance running, military training operations, team ball sports, recreational hiking, and yoga.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0; The greatest risk factors for EAH are excessive hypotonic fluid consumption beyond the capacity for normal renal free water excretion, high ambient temperature, and longer exercise time, usually exceeding 2 hours.&#x000a0;Several studies demonstrate a linear relationship between temperature and incidence of EAH.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Men and women are at equal risk for EAH when adjusted for body mass index and exercise duration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;Low oral intake, specifically of high sodium foods, may also contribute. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug use may exacerbate or propagate EAH by potentiating the water retention effects of ADH by the kidney.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>EAH is commonly an incidental finding in asymptomatic athletes. Incidences of 5-51% are reported following endurance events where athletes are screened, or their serum is analyzed for another reason.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;It is estimated that 0.1% to 1.0% of endurance athletes experience symptomatic EAH, with marathon runners, ultramarathon runners, Ironman athletes, long-distance backpackers, and military service members most commonly affected.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;The incidence in military service members is 6.9 cases per 100,000 person-years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r6">[6]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-133173.s5" sec-type="Pathophysiology">
        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>EAH stems from both increased consumption of hypotonic fluids and inappropriate water retention. Before and throughout strenuous physical activity, athletes often over hydrate with hypotonic fluids (water, sports drinks). When intake exceeds that of water lost via urine, sweat, and insensible respiratory and gastrointestinal losses (often greater than 1.5 liters), athletes may retain free water, resulting in dilutional hyponatremia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;The contribution of sodium loss from excessive sweat is controversial and not well characterized, as sweat loss varies greatly between individual athletes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>It is postulated that stimuli related to physical exertion may result in sympathetic activation of the hypothalamus, which stimulates ADH secretion from the posterior pituitary inappropriately during low osmolar states. These stimuli include pain, emotional stress, nausea, emesis, hypoglycemia, heat exposure, and medication use (particularly NSAIDs).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r4">[4]</xref> Elevated ADH leads to stimulation of renal V2 receptors, causing water reabsorption rather than excretion. The retained free water is returned to the extracellular fluid resulting in a net lowering of serum sodium concentration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>Subsequent hyponatremia results in an osmotic gradient that favors free water movement from the vascular space to the extravascular and intracellular spaces, leading to tissue edema (particularly brain and lung), which drives the most severe symptoms of EAH.</p>

      <sec id="article-133173.s6" sec-type="History and Physical">
        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>Prompt identification and differentiation from other common exertional injuries are essential to caring for an athlete with EAH. Healthcare providers should suspect EAH when athletes present during or within 24 hours following intense physical exertion, such as marathon running, cycling, triathlon, hiking, backpacking, or prolonged military field training or combat operations. The likelihood of EAH is increased if the exertional event occurred over a period greater than 2 hours or in hot weather.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>Presenting symptoms range from asymptomatic, to mild, to severe. Mild symptoms include lightheadedness, malaise, fatigue, irritability, generalized weakness, headache, nausea, and sluggish urine output.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Severe symptoms include vomiting, oliguria or anuria, altered mental status, collapse, seizure, coma, and death during sport or soon after.</p>
        <p>Diagnosis of EAH is further supported by the absence of signs of symptomatic heat illness or dehydration, such as thirst, postural dizziness, dry mucous membranes, orthostatic hypotension, and elevated core temperature.&#x000a0;Differentiating EAH from exercise heat illness and dehydration is critical, as isotonic fluid administration that would be given for the empiric treatment of either heat illness or dehydration could be life-threatening if the true diagnosis is EAH.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>On physical examination, patients with mild EAH may demonstrate mild hyperthermia, tachycardia, flushing, diaphoresis, and lethargy. Patients with severe EAH may demonstrate altered sensorium ranging from inattentiveness to complete obtundation, loss of sweating, hypotension, and abnormal limb movements.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-133173.s7" sec-type="Evaluation">
        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>Initial evaluation of suspected EAH includes vital signs, determination of mental status via the Glasgow coma scale, and assessment of airway patency, adequate respiration, and intact circulation. Accurate core temperature is key and should be taken rectally if possible to differentiate from heat illness. Exertional heat illness such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion can occur concurrently with EAH, given the similarities in precipitating events and risk factors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r6">[6]</xref></p>
        <p>The serum sodium should be determined if point-of-care (POC) serum sodium testing is available (though this is not often practical due to cost and limited functional temperature range of POC testing devices).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;A history supporting excessive hypotonic fluid intake and prolonged exertion should be taken if the patient can participate in an interview or a coach, teammate, partner, or another witness is available. A serum sodium level of less than 135 mmol/L with accompanying excessive fluid intake history is diagnostic for EAH.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r2">[2]</xref> The serum glucose should also be determined if POC glucose testing is available, as hypoglycemia can present similarly.</p>

        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>
<bold>Prehospital</bold>
</p>
        <p>Prior to treatment, EAH must be correctly differentiated from other exertional illnesses such as heat exhaustion, heatstroke, and exercise collapse associated with sickle cell trait (ECAST), as their treatments are often contradictory. Treatment is dictated by the presence or absence of neurologic symptoms. The goal of treatment is the correction of serum sodium and improvement in symptoms.</p>
        <p>If a patient does not demonstrate neurologic symptoms, EAH is considered mild, and the patient is eligible for oral fluid restriction. Patients restrict their total fluid intake to induce osmotic ADH suppression and, therefore, free water excretion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Patients may also be given concentrated oral sodium repletion, though this may be poorly tolerated due to taste or nausea and vomiting. Proposed regimens include 100 ml of hypertonic saline, 3&#x000a0;or 4 broth bouillon cubes in 125 ml of water, or a serving of salted pretzels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Oral hypertonic saline is as effective as IV hypertonic saline in mild EAH. One study demonstrated faster time to recovery and shorter duration of hospital stay for athletes who receive oral treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;IV isotonic fluids of any type or volume are not recommended in mild EAH.</p>
        <p>EAH is considered severe if a patient demonstrates neurologic symptoms (altered mental status, seizure, coma). The patient should receive a bolus of 100 ml of IV hypertonic saline.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r2">[2]</xref> This can be repeated every 10 minutes for a total of 3 doses. Up to 600-1000 ml over 1 hour of hypertonic saline has been given without complication in case studies, though larger volumes of sodium repletion increase the risk for rapid sodium correction and osmotic demyelination.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Hospital</bold>
</p>
        <p>On transfer to the hospital for advanced care, patients with suspected EAH should have immediate measurement of serum sodium and other electrolytes. Treatment in the hospital is similar to that in the field. Athletes with severe hyponatremia or evidence of cerebral edema with neurologic symptoms should be treated with a bolus of hypertonic saline as described above, with a goal serum sodium increase of 4-5 mmol/L and reversal of neurologic symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Patients with EAH encephalopathy may require ICU admission depending upon institutional criteria.</p>

        <title>Differential Diagnosis</title>
        <p>EAH falls on the spectrum of exertional injuries. The differential diagnosis for exertional injuries includes heat exhaustion, heatstroke, exercise-associated collapse, and exertional collapse associated with sickle cell trait (ECAST). Providers caring for athletes must also consider hypovolemia, hypoglycemia, sudden cardiac arrhythmia (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, prolonged QT syndrome, channelopathy), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, sudden cardiac death of unknown cause, seizure, vasovagal syncope, and malingering.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-133173.s10" sec-type="Prognosis">
        <title>Prognosis</title>
        <p>The majority of athletes recover from acute mild EAH within hours in the emergency care setting and do not require hospital admission. The duration of the emergency room stay after treatment with either oral or IV hypertonic saline solution has been reported between 50 and 79 minutes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Severe EAH requires ward or ICU admission depending upon institutional criteria.

        <title>Complications</title>
        <p>The major complications of EAH and its treatment include exercise-associated hyponatremic encephalopathy (EAHE), noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, central pontine myelinolysis, and improper treatment resulting from an alternate diagnosis.</p>
        <p>If left untreated, mild EAH can progress to severe EAH with profoundly altered mental status, seizure, and coma&#x02014;an end-stage finding due to cerebral edema termed EAHE.&#x000a0;EAHE is often fatal, though the exact mortality rate is not defined.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;The treatment for EAHE is a prompt correction of serum sodium with hypertonic saline and supportive care for its sequelae (respiratory support, seizure management).&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema may also develop secondary to osmotic dysregulation in EAH, leading to respiratory distress and the need for respiratory support.</p>
        <p>Rapid correction of hyponatremia may result in central pontine demyelination, a catastrophic and permanent demyelinating event that presents with neurologic deficits despite correction of the serum sodium.</p>

        <p>EAH can be prevented by avoiding overhydration, ensuring adequate oral sodium intake, and educating athletes, event staff, and healthcare providers on the prevention strategies and presenting symptoms.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>EAH occurs when hypotonic fluid intake exceeds total body fluid losses. Therefore the safest strategy for fluid repletion is a thirst-driven replacement to avoid overhydration. Estimates of individual athlete replacement needs by monitoring weight changes during training activities may also be used, though this may not be practical. Forced hydration, particularly at large volumes, should be discouraged.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>Salty foods may be consumed in conjunction with oral fluids as desired by the athlete to support osmotic balance during endurance events. Supplementing the serum sodium with salt tablets or packets at any particular rate or total dose during activity has not been shown to decrease rates of EAH.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-133173.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>Athletes participating in organized endurance events should be educated on the risks of overhydration, the importance of concurrent food intake, and the signs and symptoms of EAH and other heat injuries.
