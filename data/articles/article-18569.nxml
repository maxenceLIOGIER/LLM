        <p>Breast cancer is the most common non-skin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Early detection through screening can significantly reduce both morbidity and mortality. Screening recommendations distinguish between women at average and high risk for developing breast cancer, as this risk stratification guides the selection of screening methods and timing. Most major guidelines recommend starting routine mammography at age 40 for women at average risk. Although the frequency of screening&#x02014;either annually or biennially&#x02014;varies among guidelines, the overall trend is toward increased surveillance due to its potential to save lives.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Clinical breast examinations are recommended every 1 to 3 years for women aged 25 to 39 and annually for women aged 40 or older. Screening typically continues until the patient&#x02019;s life expectancy is less than age 10, with the decision to discontinue based on individual health status and overall life expectancy.&#x000a0;This activity reviews breast cancer screening for average-risk patients and offers healthcare professionals guidance on assessing breast cancer risk, conducting appropriate screenings, and implementing interprofessional management strategies to enhance patient outcomes. This activity also highlights the significance of multidisciplinary collaboration among healthcare providers to ensure comprehensive and personalized care for patients with varying levels of breast cancer risk.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18569.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;and it is the most prevalent non-skin cancer.&#x000a0;Breast cancer is also considered the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Stage IV breast cancer currently has no curative treatment and is managed with palliative care. Early detection of tumors significantly reduces morbidity and mortality. The primary challenge lies in determining who should be screened and when.&#x000a0;Additionally, as our understanding of the pathophysiology of breast cancer develops, treatment decisions are shifting away from focusing solely on tumor size and extent. Increasingly, the incorporation of genetic and biological characteristics is being used to guide prognosis and&#x000a0;treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18569.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>In addition to self-breast examinations, the primary screening methods include clinical breast evaluations and imaging techniques such as mammography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Multiple randomized studies have established that routine screening mammography should be offered to women aged 50 to 69. Historically, the recommendation for routine mammograms for women aged 40 to 49 or those aged 70 or older has been debated. However, the latest guidelines from the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS), and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) now advocate starting routine mammograms at age 40.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18569.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The frequency of screening remains a topic of debate, with some groups recommending annual screening for average-risk individuals while others advocate for biennial screening. Overall, there has been a trend toward expanded screening, as breast cancer detection at early and treatable stages has saved countless lives. Differentiating between average-risk and high-risk patients is crucial for optimizing patient outcomes, as screening recommendations vary for these populations. Our growing understanding of oncogenic genetic mutations and other breast cancer risk factors has led to the development of several breast cancer risk prediction models, such as the Gail model and the Tyrer-Cuzick model. These models facilitate the stratification of breast cancer screening based on an individual's lifetime risk of developing the disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18569.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>In addition to mammography, ultrasonography and breast MRI are recommended for screening for high-risk women.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18569.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;High-risk patients, symptomatic individuals, and breast cancer survivors should be identified and referred to a breast center for evaluation by a breast cancer specialist to receive appropriate screening recommendations.&#x000a0;Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/18564">Breast Cancer</ext-link>," for more information on high-risk factors for breast cancer.</p>

        <title>Anatomy and Physiology</title>
        <p>The mature adult breast&#x000a0;comprises skin, subcutaneous tissue, and epithelial and stromal components. The epithelial component includes branching ducts that connect the structural and functional units of the breast, known as lobules, to the nipple. The stromal component, made up of fibrous and adipose tissue, constitutes the majority of the breast's volume in a non-lactating state.</p>
        <p>Breast tissue extends vertically from the second to the sixth ribs and horizontally from the sternal edge to the midaxillary line. A portion of the breast tissue, known as the axillary tail of Spence, projects into the axilla. The skin of the breast is thin and contains sebaceous glands, exocrine sweat glands, and hair follicles. While the nipple lacks hair follicles, it is rich in sensory nerve endings and contains sebaceous and apocrine glands. The areola, which measures approximately 16 to 60 mm, is nearly circular and features increased pigmentation. Elevations near the periphery of the areola, known as Morgagni tubercles, form due to the openings of large sebaceous glands called Montgomery glands, which represent a transitional stage between sweat and mammary glands.</p>
        <p>The breast is covered by superficial pectoral fascia, which extends into the superficial abdominal fascia of Camper. From beneath, the breast is encased in deep pectoral fascia, which covers the pectoralis major and serratus anterior muscles. These 2 fascial layers are interconnected by fibrous bands known as Cooper's suspensory ligaments, which provide natural support to the breasts. Most of the breast's blood supply comes from the internal mammary vessels. Sensory innervation primarily originates from the anterolateral and anteromedial branches of thoracic intercostal nerves T3 to T5. Lower fibers from the supraclavicular nerves of the cervical plexus also contribute to breast sensation.</p>

<bold>The American Society of Breast Surgeons&#x000a0;Screening Recommendations</bold>
</p>
        <p>The ASBrS guidelines recommend that all women aged 25 or older undergo a formal breast cancer risk assessment, with updates provided at appropriate intervals. Screening mammography should be discontinued when a woman's life expectancy is less than 10 years.</p>
        <p>Women with an average risk of breast cancer and normal breast density should initiate yearly screening mammography, preferably 3-dimensional (3D) mammography, starting at age 40 without the need for supplemental imaging. For women with an average risk of breast cancer and heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts, yearly screening mammography, also preferably 3D, should start at age 40, with supplemental imaging considered.</p>
        <p>Women at higher-than-average risk of breast cancer due to hereditary susceptibility from pathogenic mutation carrier status or prior chest wall radiation between the ages of 10 and 30 should begin yearly screening mammography at age 30 and be offered annual supplemental MRI starting at age 25. Additionally, women with a higher-than-average risk of breast cancer due to a predicted lifetime risk greater than 20% from any model or a strong family history should undergo yearly screening mammography and be offered annual supplemental MRI&#x000a0;starting at age 35, as recommended by&#x000a0;their clinician.</p>
        <p>For women aged 50 or older with a prior history of breast cancer and non-dense breasts who did not undergo bilateral mastectomy, annual mammography, preferably 3D, is recommended. For women younger than 50 or those with dense breasts who have a prior history of breast cancer and did not undergo bilateral mastectomy, annual 3D mammography along with yearly supplemental MRI starting at age 35, as recommended by their clinician, is advised.</p>

        <p>Supplemental screening options such as breast MRI with and without contrast, abbreviated breast MRI, ultrasound, molecular breast imaging, or contrast-enhanced mammography can improve cancer detection rates but may also increase recall rates and lead to benign breast biopsies. For individuals at high risk of breast cancer, current evidence and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) safety announcement on gadolinium-based contrast agents support the continued recommendation for annual MRI in combination with annual screening mammography with tomosynthesis following shared decision-making.</p>
        <p>For high-risk individuals who cannot undergo breast MRI, supplemental screening with contrast-enhanced mammography or molecular breast imaging is recommended. Whole breast ultrasound may be considered if contrast-enhanced or functional imaging is unavailable or inaccessible. Individuals with a residual lifetime breast cancer risk of 15% to 20% may be considered for supplemental screening based on individual risk factors. Abbreviated MRI demonstrates a higher cancer detection rate than mammography with tomosynthesis or ultrasound and likely offers similar sensitivity compared to a full diagnostic breast MRI protocol.</p>
        <p>The NCCN panel recommends that women with average risk between the ages of 25 and 39 undergo a clinical assessment, risk-reduction counseling, and a clinical breast examination every 1 to 3 years. They should also be advised to notify their clinician immediately if they notice any changes in their breasts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18569.r7">[7]</xref></p>

            <p>In limited-resource settings with relatively strong health systems, organized population-based mammography screening programs are recommended for women aged 50 to 69, conducted every 2 years, provided the conditions for implementing such a program are met. The WHO advises against mammography screening for women aged 40 to 49 and those aged 70 to 75 in these settings.</p>

<bold>Breast Mammography</bold>
</p>
        <p>Mammography is a low-dose x-ray modality used for detailed imaging of the breast and is considered the most effective population-based screening method. This technique can detect microcalcifications smaller than 100 &#x003bc;m, allowing for the identification of lesions before they become palpable. Mammography is performed in 2 forms&#x02014;screening and diagnostic.</p>
        <p>A screening mammogram is the appropriate study for asymptomatic patients at average risk. A diagnostic mammogram is required for further evaluation if an abnormality is detected during screening.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18569.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;Tomosynthesis and 3D mammography are preferred methods due to their enhanced ability to detect small cancers and reduce the likelihood of false positives.</p>
        <p>Breast Imaging Reporting and Data Systems (BI-RADS) are used to guide breast cancer diagnostic evaluation. BI-RADS&#x000a0;categorizes breast lesions in a standardized format, allowing for consistent interpretation among radiologists. However, most screening mammograms do not reveal evidence of cancer upon further testing. Approximately 1% to 2% of screening mammograms identify an abnormality that necessitates a biopsy, and around 80% of the biopsied lesions are benign.</p>

<bold>Additional Breast Imaging Studies</bold>
</p>
        <p>MRI of the breast is generally more expensive than mammography, and it requires intravenous gadolinium contrast and takes longer to perform. However, MRI is more sensitive than mammography for detecting specific breast lesions and provides expanded views of the lymph nodes. In high-risk women, screening MRI is considered less specific but more sensitive than mammography for detecting invasive cancers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18569.r5">[5]</xref> Breast MRI is not recommended for women at average risk; however, it is advised for those with an elevated lifetime risk of breast cancer. This includes women with dense breast tissue, some patients with silicone breast implants, and individuals who cannot tolerate the discomfort caused by traditional mammography compression.</p>
        <p>Thermography techniques measure elevated skin temperatures overlying breast cancers but are not routinely used in screening or included in standard screening guidelines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18569.r14">[14]</xref>&#x000a0;Ultrasound is usually used to evaluate&#x000a0;abnormalities detected during a clinical examination or screening mammography. This imaging modality can aid in assessing patients with dense breasts as an adjunct to screening mammograms. However, ultrasound has limited use as a primary screening technique due to various factors, including the inability to find microcalcifications and poor specificity.</p>

        <p>Patients may sometimes detect breast cancer by noticing changes in their breasts. They should be advised to inform their clinician of any changes occurring in their breasts. Any alteration in the breast should prompt a clinical assessment, with further diagnostic evaluation performed as indicated by current guidelines.</p>
        <p>Primary clinicians should remain vigilant for patients at high risk for breast cancer, defined as having a greater than 20% lifetime risk according to any breast cancer risk assessment model (eg, Gail and Tyrer-Cuzick). For high-risk screening recommendations, these patients should be evaluated by a breast cancer specialist at a dedicated breast cancer center. Additionally, patients with a strong family history of cancers&#x02014;particularly breast, ovarian, prostate, stomach, or pancreatic cancer&#x02014;should be considered for genetic testing and referred to a genetic counselor if they express interest.</p>

        <title>Preparation</title>
        <p>Periodic assessment of the patient's personal and family history is essential for healthcare clinicians. This evaluation should include risk factors, prior biopsy results, radiation exposure, and family history of breast cancer. Identifying women who may benefit from genetic counseling and high-risk screening by a breast cancer specialist is crucial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18569.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Recent studies promote the concept of breast self-awareness, which involves being attuned to the appearance and feel of a woman's breasts and the ability to notice any changes. Women are encouraged to report any changes to their primary healthcare clinician. In contrast, breast self-examination involves a regular and systematic approach to assessing the breasts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18569.r15">[15]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-18569.s9" sec-type="Technique or Treatment">
        <title>Technique or Treatment</title>
        <p>Imaging techniques for breast cancer screening are most effective when considering both sensitivity and specificity while also accounting for potential complications and harms to the screening population. The preferred imaging method is mammography, followed by commonly used modalities such as ultrasonography and MRI. Additionally, breast self-examination and clinical breast examinations remain important components of breast cancer detection.</p>
        <p>Screening methods, such as mammography, are most effective when targeted strategies are used, considering age and other factors, including hormonal exposure, family history, and risk factors such as radiation, obesity, and genetics. MRI involves the injection of intravenous contrast material, which enhances the ability to differentiate normal breast tissue from abnormal lesions.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-18569.s10" sec-type="Complications">
        <title>Complications</title>
        <p>Mammography has its limitations as a screening imaging method. Research indicates that it is less sensitive in detecting cancer in dense breast tissue, which can result in false-negative outcomes and the potential for missed cancers, if&#x000a0;present. Some breast cancers may be mammographically occult, failing to appear on traditional mammograms. Thus, it is essential to conduct imaging alongside a physical examination by a healthcare clinician. Further diagnostic imaging, such as MRI or ultrasound, should be ordered when discrepancies arise. Additionally, high-risk patients should be screened appropriately, often utilizing MRI for more accurate detection.</p>
        <p>Increased treatment interventions are associated with screening, which may not always be effective or necessary. Individuals who undergo screening are more likely to experience surgery and radiation therapy. Overscreening can have negative consequences for patients, including economic, psychological, cosmetic, physical, and productivity-related harm. The overall lifetime radiation exposure increases with the age of initiation, frequency, and cessation of screening, as women are exposed to approximately 3.7 mGy per digital mammogram. This raises the risk of radiation-induced breast cancer to 125 cases per 100,000 women aged 40 to 74, potentially leading to an increase in deaths attributed to breast cancer screening.</p>
        <p>Ultrasonography is generally considered a highly operator-dependent modality and supplemental screening test that requires a skilled practitioner, high-quality examination, and state-of-the-art equipment. Based on the findings from various studies, a prospective, multicenter study is warranted to further investigate the role of this imaging modality in breast cancer screening.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18569.r16">[16]</xref></p>

        <title>Clinical Significance</title>
        <p>Age should not be the sole factor in determining breast cancer screening. A comprehensive assessment of all relevant risk factors&#x02014;including breast density, genetics, and personal history&#x02014;should guide the screening process.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18569.r17">[17]</xref> Additionally, the sensitivity and specificity of mammography tend to improve with advancing age compared to younger women.</p>
        <p>Dense breast tissue is a common finding on mammograms, particularly in younger women, as breast density typically decreases with age. However, dense breasts, especially in older patients, are associated with a higher likelihood of developing breast cancer, and small lesions can be more challenging to detect on traditional mammograms. While mammography may reduce sensitivity in detecting breast cancer among women with dense breasts, alternative screening strategies such as MRI and ultrasonography can be utilized. These methods are particularly recommended for women at higher risk of developing breast cancer.</p>
        <p>An early age of initiation for screening and the use of MRI and ultrasound may be considered for women with first-degree relatives diagnosed with breast cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18569.r5">[5]</xref> For BRCA mutation carriers, a combination of annual breast MRI and mammography is recommended for breast cancer screening. It is essential to accurately identify patients with a greater than 20% lifetime risk of breast cancer and to recognize that standard screening guidelines for asymptomatic average-risk patients do not apply to this population. High-risk individuals should be referred to a breast cancer specialist for tailored screening recommendations and, if appropriate, to a genetic counselor for genetic testing.</p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>Screening average-risk breast cancer patients necessitates a collaborative and interprofessional approach to enhance patient-centered care, improve outcomes, and ensure safety. Physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, radiologists, and technicians must work together to balance the benefits and risks of screening. Clinicians are responsible for identifying risk factors and providing appropriate screening based on age, breast density, and family history. Effective counseling, especially for patients with genetic predispositions, requires shared decision-making. Radiologists and technicians must skillfully perform and interpret imaging to minimize false positives and negatives. This coordinated effort fosters a comprehensive care strategy that improves diagnosis and patient outcomes.</p>
