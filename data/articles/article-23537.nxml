        <p content-type="pubmed-excerpt">Poliomyelitis is a highly infectious&#x000a0;viral illness&#x000a0;that can lead to permanent disability. Global vaccination efforts have drastically reduced the incidence of polio, bringing the disease to the brink of eradication. The oral polio vaccine remains a vital tool in many parts of the world due to its low cost and ease of administration, though there is a rare risk of paralysis associated with this vaccine. In contrast, the inactivated polio vaccine is used exclusively in countries with&#x000a0;adequate sanitation infrastructure, including the United States, where the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus is minimized.</p>
        <p>This activity reviews the mechanisms of action, administration routes, formulations, adverse events, and patient eligibility for both oral and inactivated polio vaccines. With ongoing wild-type polio transmission in Afghanistan and Pakistan and the emergence of vaccine-derived poliovirus, vaccination remains a priority for global public health. The role of the interprofessional healthcare team is crucial in achieving the eradication goal, ensuring widespread immunization, and monitoring for adverse effects.</p>

<bold>World Health Organization Recommendations</bold>
</p>
        <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) provides global guidance for poliomyelitis vaccination. Individual countries have developed national guidelines based on WHO recommendations while considering&#x000a0;national epidemiology, risk&#x000a0;tolerance levels, resources, and other factors.&#x000a0;Clinicians should always check&#x000a0;national policies to ensure they follow the latest indications and recommendations for administering the poliovirus vaccine.&#x000a0;Please refer to the <bold>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes&#x000a0;</bold>section for more information on vaccine types and their uses in outbreak situations.</p>
        <p><bold>Routine vaccination:&#x000a0;</bold>As of 2022, the WHO recommends one of the following polio vaccination regimens using the injectable polio vaccine (IPV)&#x000a0;with or without the oral polio vaccine (OPV) as part of routine immunization for all children worldwide.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-WER9725-277-300">[World Health Organization.

        <p>Countries may choose alternative schedules of OPV followed by IPV based on the local epidemiology, feasibility of delivery, and costs. Some countries with high vaccination&#x000a0;rates and a low risk of introducing poliovirus may have concerns regarding vaccine-associated paralytic polio; guidelines in these countries may&#x000a0;recommend a&#x000a0;sequential schedule with 2 doses of IPV followed by at least 2 doses of bivalent&#x000a0;OPV.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-WER9725-277-300">[World Health Organization.

        <p>The WHO&#x000a0;also recommends that all countries maintain high&#x000a0;vaccination rates as part of the global effort to eradicate poliovirus. On the individual level, the WHO emphasizes vaccination&#x000a0;for the following groups:</p>

<bold>United States Recommendations</bold>
</p>
        <p>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), authorized by the&#x000a0;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), provides specific recommendations for vaccine administration in the United States. After being declared free of wild-type poliovirus (WPV) in 1994, the United States began administering IPV exclusively in 2000.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23537.r1">[1]</xref><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/polio/about/index.html">[CDC. About Polio in the United States]</ext-link>&#x000a0;The United States Food and Drug Administration no longer approves OPV.</p>
        <p><bold>Children:&#x000a0;</bold>The CDC recommends the polio vaccine as part of routine vaccination for all children.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23537.r2">[2]</xref> The recommended series&#x000a0;consists of 4 doses&#x02014;the first two doses are given at 2 and 4 months, followed by a third dose at 6 to 18 months, and&#x000a0;a final dose at 4 to 6 years.</p>
        <p>Infants at increased risk of exposure, such as outbreak and travel, or who are off-schedule may require&#x000a0;individualized&#x000a0;vaccination scheduling.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23537.r2">[2]</xref> The minimum recommended age for the first dose is 6 weeks. Each of the first 3 doses must be separated by at least 4 weeks.

        <p>Infants typically receive IPV as part of a 4-dose multivalent vaccine schedule, with all doses generally administered before the child is 2<bold>.</bold> This practice is acceptable to the ACIP. However, these children should still receive a booster dose after 4 years, making 5 IPV doses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23537.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;A&#x000a0;fourth dose is unnecessary assuming 2 conditions are met&#x02014;the child is 4 years old when receiving&#x000a0;the third dose,&#x000a0;and this third dose is administered at least 6 months after the second.</p>
        <p>Children immigrating to the United States who have been vaccinated with OPV only since April 2016 should be revaccinated with a complete IPV series to provide full protection against WPV2.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23537.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;Any fully documented IPV doses are acceptable&#x000a0;towards the completion of&#x000a0;the series.&#x000a0;Children with insufficient documentation should be revaccinated;&#x000a0;only written&#x000a0;and correctly dated records are acceptable.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/infections-diseases/poliomyelitis">[CDC.

        <p>The CDC's 2023 update for adults contains a strengthened recommendation to provide a primary polio vaccination series to all adults known or suspected to be unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated, focusing on those at higher risk.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23537.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;All household members&#x000a0;and caregivers of international adoptees from countries with active WPV or vaccine-derived poliovirus circulation who are incompletely vaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown should&#x000a0;be assessed and vaccinated before the child enters the country.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/infections-diseases/poliomyelitis">[CDC. Poliomyelitis]</ext-link>&#x000a0;This recommendation has been reinforced by a recent case of paralytic polio caused by vaccine-derived poliovirus and the continued risk of imported wild-type or vaccine-derived viruses in the United States. Although most&#x000a0;adults in the United States were vaccinated as children, vaccine hesitancy or refusal among some groups leaves pockets of people susceptible to infection and paralytic polio. Unimmunized adults require 3 doses of polio vaccine, with the second dose given 1 to 2 months after the first&#x000a0;and the third dose administered 6 to 12 months after the second.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/polio/vaccines/index.html">[CDC. Polio Vaccination]</ext-link></p>
        <p>
<bold>Rationale for Polio Vaccination</bold>
</p>
        <p>The polio vaccine effectively prevents poliomyelitis, a severely disabling and deforming disease caused by poliovirus. There is no cure for polio, and survivors&#x000a0;experience&#x000a0;significant morbidity and a poor quality of life; therefore, prevention is vital. This&#x000a0;single-stranded RNA virus is highly infectious, spreading from person to person through the fecal-oral or oral-oral routes. Although children younger than&#x000a0;5 are most commonly infected, the virus can infect people of any age who are under or unimmunized.</p>
        <p>After exposure, the virus multiplies in the infected individual's throat and gastrointestinal tract.&#x000a0;As many as 75% to 90% of infected individuals remain asymptomatic, although they may shed the virus and infect others.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/poliomyelitis#tab=tab_1">[World Health Organization. Poliomyelitis (polio)]</ext-link><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/polio/about/index.html">[CDC. About Polio in the United States]</ext-link>&#x000a0;Among individuals who become symptomatic, most develop an acute nonspecific illness, with fever, fatigue, headache, myalgias, sore throat, abdominal pain, and vomiting that resolves within 10 days.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt12-polio.html">[CDC. Chapter 12: Poliomyelitis]</ext-link></p>
        <p>The poliovirus invades the central nervous system (CNS) in a small percentage of individuals, including those who are asymptomatic.&#x000a0;The return of fever,&#x000a0;headache, and meningismus often heralds invasion.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/polio/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html">[CDC. Clinical Overview of Poliomyelitis]</ext-link>&#x000a0;In 1% to 5% of individuals infected with the poliovirus, CNS invasion results in viral meningitis that typically resolves with no sequelae.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/polio/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html">[CDC. Clinical Overview of Poliomyelitis]</ext-link>&#x000a0;However, approximately 1 in every 200 to 2000&#x000a0;infected individuals experiences headache and meningismus accompanied by severe extremity pain and muscle spasms, followed by weakness or paralysis of the extremities, trunk muscles, or diaphragm.&#x000a0;Paralytic polio has a&#x000a0;high mortality risk, with 10% to 20% ultimately dying due to respiratory failure.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmid" xlink:href="29959591">[6]</ext-link><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/polio/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html">[CDC. Clinical Overview of Poliomyelitis]</ext-link></p>
        <p>Following massive global outbreaks beginning in the early 20th&#x000a0;century, Jonas Salk pioneered an IPV comprised of inactivated (or killed) poliovirus particles.&#x000a0;This vaccine became available in the United States in 1955. Albert Sabin introduced a live, oral, attenuated (or weakened) polio vaccine&#x000a0;6 years later.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23537.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;These vaccines protect against all known WPV strains, called types 1, 2, and 3.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23537.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <p>The widespread use of these vaccines led to the&#x000a0;elimination&#x000a0;of WPV disease in Canada, the United States, and the rest of the Americas, with the last recorded cases in 1977, 1979, and 1991, respectively. Successes in the Americas led to establishing the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) in 1988, a partnership&#x000a0;formed by the WHO, CDC, national governments, and others. The GPEI coordinates and supports global activities, following an&#x000a0;evolving strategy informed by&#x000a0;updated epidemiological data and incorporating the newest polio vaccine research technologies.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240031937">[World Health Organization.

Polio vaccines: WHO position paper &#x02013; June 2022]</ext-link>&#x000a0;WPV1 remains endemic in only 2 countries&#x02014;Pakistan and Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>Although&#x000a0;the world is tantalizingly close to achieving polio eradication, this goal has proven more challenging than the successful eradication of smallpox.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23537.r1">[1]</xref> A primary obstacle is the emergence of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses, which cause disease indistinguishable from wild polioviruses. Recombination with other enteroviruses or reversion of OPV strains allows circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses to regain WPV virulence and transmissibility.&#x000a0;Circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses account for more polio cases worldwide than WPVs, predominantly occurring in countries with inadequate water, poor sanitation, and poor hygiene infrastructure.&#x000a0;Recent findings of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses in wastewater from several industrialized nations show that polioviruses can still spread despite high vaccination rates with IPV.&#x000a0;Circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses&#x000a0;also resulted in paralytic polio&#x000a0;in&#x000a0;a young, unimmunized individual who had not traveled outside the United States in 2022.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Recent outbreaks of WPV in previously polio-free&#x000a0;nations such as Malawi and&#x000a0;Mozambique are also of continued concern, as is the silent spread of WPV in Israel among a population highly vaccinated with IPV. Many nations remain at high risk of polio reintroduction due to factors such as insufficient water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure,&#x000a0;war,&#x000a0;poverty, political instability, and lack of political commitment.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240031937">[World Health Organization. Polio eradication strategy 2022&#x02013;2026: delivering on a promise]</ext-link></p>
        <p>To ensure optimal patient outcomes while contributing to global polio eradication, clinicians must be aware of national polio vaccination guidelines&#x000a0;and promote complete vaccination&#x000a0;for all at-risk children and&#x000a0;adults, including travelers and&#x000a0;immigrants. As long as poliovirus exists anywhere, it remains a global threat.</p>

        <p>IPVs contain inactivated (killed) forms of all 3 poliovirus types.&#x000a0;Available vaccines include the Salk IPV, which contains WPV strains, and the Sabin IPV, which contains Sabin strains. The Sabin IPV has limited global use and is unavailable in the United States. The modern Salk IPV&#x000a0;is more antigenic than&#x000a0;earlier versions,&#x000a0;often referred to as enhanced IPV.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-WER9725-277-300">[World Health Organization.

        <p>Polioviruses for IPV are grown in human diploid cells or Vero cell culture and inactivated with formaldehyde before being incorporated into the vaccine. The inactivated antigens produce a robust humoral response in the vaccine recipient but limited mucosal immunity. Compared to individuals experiencing primary infection, those vaccinated with IPV shed less poliovirus from the pharynx but similar amounts through the gastrointestinal tract.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23537.r17">[9]</xref><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-WER9725-277-300">[World Health Organization.

Poverty, crowding, inadequate water, poor sanitation, and other associated socioeconomic factors increase the likelihood of&#x000a0;spread. When administered after exposure to WPV&#x000a0;or OPV, IPV also boosts mucosal immunity.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-WER9725-277-300">[World Health Organization.

Following immunization, most non-immune individuals who receive OPV shed vaccine-derived poliovirus from the pharynx for a few days and from the stool for 4 to 6 weeks. Contact with viruses shed by OPV vaccination&#x000a0;individuals&#x000a0;enhances immunity among household members and others close to these&#x000a0;individuals, thereby extending the impact of vaccination programs.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-WER9725-277-300">[World Health Organization.

        <p>Host mucosal immunity&#x000a0;suppresses the replication and excretion of poliovirus, reducing the risk of transmission during subsequent exposure to wild-type or vaccine-derived polioviruses.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-WER9725-277-300">[World Health Organization.

        <p>Affordable, easy to administer, and effective in halting transmission, OPVs remain vital tools for global polio eradication, primarily used in endemic countries and at risk of reintroduction of WPV.&#x000a0;Although immensely successful in eliminating the WPV, the high mutability of the virus causes vaccine-associated paralytic polio and has led to the emergence of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses.&#x000a0;Novel OPVs have&#x000a0;enhanced genetic stability compared to the original OPVs, created by modifying the&#x000a0;genomes&#x000a0;of the original Sabin OPV strains at specific locations&#x02014;domain V, <italic toggle="yes">cre</italic>-element, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-WER9725-277-300">[World Health Organization.

        <p>In children and infants, IPV is preferentially administered as part of multivalent vaccines for&#x000a0;multiple routine childhood diseases, such as&#x000a0;pentavalent or hexavalent vaccines with diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis, <italic toggle="yes">Haemophilus influenza</italic> type&#x000a0;b, hepatitis B, or, most recently, whole-cell pertussis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23537.r9">[9]</xref><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-WER9725-277-300">[World Health Organization.

No interference occurs with the coadministration of IPV with other vaccines. The site of IPV administration depends on the patient's age and size, with preference given to the anterolateral thigh in infants and the deltoid in children and adults.</p>
        <p>Standalone IPV is a 0.5 mL intramuscular injection used most frequently&#x000a0;for&#x000a0;patients with sufficient immunity to other diseases or require&#x000a0;rapid development of immunity. For example, clinicians may provide standalone IPV to travelers heading to an endemic area&#x000a0;or individuals presenting to vaccination clinics during campaigns or outbreak responses in endemic countries. Some countries use standalone IPV administered as a subcutaneous fractional dose (0.1 mL or one-fifth of a regular dose) in vaccination campaigns to extend vaccine supply and decrease costs.&#x000a0;IPV may be administered safely to immunocompromised, pregnant, and breastfeeding individuals.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-WER9725-277-300">[World Health Organization.

        <p>Seroconversion rates following the administration of IPV and OPV vary across settings, polio types, age of vaccine receipt, and interval between doses.

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>The interprofessional healthcare team is pivotal in planning, monitoring, and administering polio vaccinations. Counseling people who are vaccine-hesitant, providing routine vaccines in the primary care office, pharmacy, or public health clinic, delivering mass immunization campaigns to control outbreaks, and monitoring vaccination rates are examples of interprofessional&#x000a0;team&#x000a0;functions&#x000a0;contributing to polio eradication.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Outbreak Control</bold>
</p>
        <p>Coordinated immunization activity between public health authorities, clinicians, pharmacists, community agencies, community health workers, and other healthcare providers&#x000a0;is critical for rapid polio outbreak control. An outbreak is defined as&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;or more genetically linked polioviruses from patients, asymptomatic contacts or carriers, or environmental samples.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23537.r16">[16]</xref>&#x000a0;The WHO and national and local governments provide essential support for vaccine program implementation during outbreaks.</p>
        <p>Using the polio vaccine appropriate to&#x000a0;the poliovirus outbreak strain rapidly interrupts transmission and stops outbreaks due to wild-type or circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus. Based on local epidemiology and the circumstances of the outbreak, public health authorities may recommend IPV or monovalent, bivalent, or trivalent&#x000a0;OPVs. Novel OPV2 was licensed under Emergency Use Listing in 2020 for response to outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-WER9725-277-300">[World Health Organization. Polio vaccines: WHO position paper &#x02013; June 2022]</ext-link>&#x000a0;The vaccine remains in limited supply, necessitating the continued use of OPV2 in some outbreak situations. Novel OPV2&#x000a0;is not used in routine immunization programs.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Improving Vaccine Coverage Rates</bold>
</p>
        <p>The interprofessional healthcare team has a crucial role in improving polio vaccination rates, which are suboptimal in many jurisdictions.&#x000a0;Globally, the coverage rate for 3 doses of either OPV or IPV at 12 months was approximately 84% in 2022.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23537.r12">[12]</xref> This rate&#x000a0;compares to an estimated coverage rate of 81% and 83% in 2021 and 2022 and an 85% to 87% average between 2014 and 2019, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on polio and other routine vaccinations.</p>
        <p>The global vaccination rates for at least&#x000a0;1 dose&#x000a0;of IPV after bivalent&#x000a0;OPV were 83% in 2019, 80% in 2020 and 2021, and 84% in 2022.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23537.r12">[12]</xref> The estimated coverage rates of 3 OPV doses and at least 1 IPV dose were 76% and 71% in Afghanistan and 85% and 90% in Pakistan in 2022. However, rates in areas with circulating WPV1&#x000a0;are much lower.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23537.r17">[17]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23537.r12">[12]</xref></p>
        <p>Among children&#x000a0;younger than 2 in the United States born in 2017-2018 and 2019-2020, vaccination rates were&#x000a0;92.6% and 93.0% for at least 3 doses of IPV.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23537.r18">[18]</xref>&#x000a0;These rates indicate the United States maintained vaccination rates in this age group in the early stages of the COVID pandemic. However, rates&#x000a0;are variable across populations. Specifically, infants who are non-Hispanic White, living at or above the poverty line, privately insured, or&#x000a0;living in urban areas&#x000a0;have higher vaccination rates. The differences can be stark. For example, 95.6% of infants with full private insurance had 3 or more doses of IPV,&#x000a0;compared to 80.0% of those without insurance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23537.r18">[18]</xref> A lower rate of attachment to the healthcare system is&#x000a0;a critical barrier in this group.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23537.r17">[17]</xref>&#x000a0;Other children eligible for the Vaccines for Children program likewise had lower polio vaccination rates than entirely privately insured children, with lower completion rates of multi-dose vaccines following the first year of life.</p>
        <p>An increasing number of parents&#x000a0;are&#x000a0;reluctant to provide polio or other vaccinations for their children, a preexisting problem&#x000a0;that worsened during the pandemic. Through building relationships, consistent messaging, and answering all questions, the interprofessional team&#x000a0;can gain the trust of patients and their families and improve vaccination rates. The inactivated polio vaccine has no long-term adverse effects. Furthermore, the complications of acquiring polio can be&#x000a0;severe and long-lasting.&#x000a0;OPV is the primary contributor towards a greater than 99.9% reduction in polio around the world, and severe side effects are extremely rare.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://polioeradication.org/about-polio/the-vaccines/">GPEI. The Vaccines</ext-link></p>
        <p>Many unvaccinated or under-vaccinated people in the United States and elsewhere have inadequate opportunities for immunization&#x000a0;due to time; logistics; costs associated with financial barriers, such as copayments, childcare, and transportation; bureaucratic hurdles; or a multitude of other&#x000a0;factors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23537.r17">[19]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23537.r17">[17]</xref> A lack of awareness about available services or the absence of nearby, patient-centered healthcare options further contributes to lower vaccination rates. For example, services requiring multiple visits or visits across different providers can cause barriers, and patients may be unaware of the United States Vaccines for Children Program. Coordinated activity across interprofessional teams and others reduces barriers and increases opportunities for vaccination.</p>
        <p>Using open communication and data sharing, the interprofessional healthcare team can leverage non-governmental agencies, community leaders, governments, and others to educate the public about the risks and benefits of polio and other vaccinations, overcome vaccine hesitancy, and contribute to patient and public health.</p>
        <p>Supplementary immunization activities, also known as vaccination campaigns, are an important way to increase local vaccination rates in areas not&#x000a0;adequately covered by routine immunization programs and to control outbreaks. The WHO recommends bivalent or monovalent&#x000a0;OPV for these activities, depending on the epidemiology and purpose of the campaign.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240031937">[World Health Organization.

<bold>The Evolution of Polio Immunization</bold>
</p>
        <p>Since Jonas Salk developed the first polio vaccine in 1955, public health authorities, clinicians, researchers, and healthcare providers&#x000a0;have improved and adapted polio immunization technologies and strategies to address current challenges optimally. Sabin OPV largely replaced Salk IPV in the 1960s due to OPV's lower cost, ease of administration, and ability to prevent onward transmission. Trivalent OPV&#x02014;OPV1, OPV2, and OPV3&#x02014;replaced the original monovalent OPVs&#x02014;OPV1, OPV2, or OPV3&#x02014;starting in 1963. Polio-free countries switched to enhanced IPVs, as the risks of vaccine-associated paralytic polio and circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses outweighed the benefits of OPV. In 2016, the GPEI organized a coordinated global switch from trivalent to bivalent OPV (OPV1 and OPV3) due to increasing global rates and&#x000a0;expanding distribution of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2. In 2022, the WHO recommended adding 2 doses of IPV in&#x000a0;countries that previously used only OPV. The recent availability of novel OPV2 for outbreak control is one of the latest updates to the strategy over time.</p>
        <p>New approaches remain essential. The vaccination strategy priorities of the GPEI and other public health authorities include the following:</p>

            <p>Reducing and eliminating the risk of WPV release from vaccine production</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>New and developing strategies include fractional dosing of IPV and aluminum-adjuvanted IPV, which require less antigen content per dose, thus extending the IPV vaccine supply and decreasing costs.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-WER9725-277-300">[World Health Organization. Polio vaccines: WHO position paper &#x02013; June 2022]</ext-link></p>
        <p>Extending Sabin-based IPV to more countries reduces the risk of accidental WPV release. Sabin-based&#x000a0;IPV production requires less stringent biocontainment requirements than Salk IPV, lowering production costs. Meta-analysis showed no significant differences&#x000a0;in seroconversion compared to Salk IPV.</p>
        <p>Research continues into the development of new vaccines, including increasingly stable novel OPV2; novel OPV1 and OPV3 to eventually replace Sabin OPV; and other IPVs with a noninfectious process&#x000a0;to reduce the accidental poliovirus reintroduction risk, including virus-like particle vaccines and messenger&#x000a0;RNA vaccines.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240031937">[World Health Organization.
