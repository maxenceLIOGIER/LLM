        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>The trachea is a tube-like structure beginning at the base of the cricoid cartilage and extending to the carina. It has cervical and thoracic portions, separated at the level of the thoracic inlet above and below respectively. It includes 18 to 22 D-shaped rings which are cartilaginous anteriorly and laterally and membranous posteriorly. Blood supply to the cervical portions of the trachea comes from branches of the subclavian artery where they enter laterally and anastomose superiorly, inferiorly, and anteriorly. Thoracic portions receive their blood supply from the bronchial arteries which branch off the aorta. The trachea is near the esophagus, vagus nerve, recurrent laryngeal nerves, thyroid, carotid arteries, jugular veins, innominate arteries and veins, the pulmonary trunk, the azygos vein, and the aorta with the vertebra and spinal cord posteriorly.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>With so many vital structures adjacent to the trachea, the majority of patients with tracheal injuries may expire before arrival at an emergency department. The major causes of tracheal injury include iatrogenic, blunt trauma, penetrating trauma, inhalation and aspiration of liquids or objects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r2">[2]</xref> The most common site for tracheal injuries from blunt trauma is within 2.5 cm of the carina.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r3">[3]</xref> Tracheal lacerations can be transverse, spiral, or longitudinal with varying degrees of tissue involvement.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>One of the most crucial factors for reducing morbidity and mortality is early detection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r5">[5]</xref> With a high index of suspicion, the physical and radiographic signs most frequently seen with tracheal injury were dyspnea, pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, and subcutaneous emphysema.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Proper airway management is vital. When appropriate, it is best achieved by awake intubation over a flexible bronchoscope with the placement of an endotracheal tube distal to the site of injury.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r5">[5]</xref> Management of laceration repair can then be accomplished either conservatively or surgically depending on the cause of the injury, the depth, and the concomitant injuries sustained.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r6">[6]</xref> Despite early recognition and appropriate management, potential complications include; decreased lung function, infection, vocal cord paralysis, and strictures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r3">[3]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-30413.s3" sec-type="Etiology">
        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>Iatrogenic causes include percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy, endotracheal intubation, and rigid bronchoscopy. &#x000a0;With endotracheal intubation, certain situations predispose the patient to complications including emergency, the skill of the operator, improper use of a stylet, use of a high-pressure cuff, and manipulation of the tube with a blocked cuff. &#x000a0;Patient-specific risk factors for iatrogenic tracheal injury include age between 50 and 70, elevated BMI, female gender, and long term use of corticosteroids.&#x000a0; Most iatrogenic tracheal injuries tend to occur in the posterior membranous portion of the trachea.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>Blunt trauma primarily affects the thoracic trachea. In the cervical trachea, blunt trauma will typically cause damage to the cartilaginous portions. For blunt thoracic trauma, three theories exist to explain the cause of tracheal injury. The first primarily occurs in crush injuries where increased force causes shortening of the anteroposterior axis and widening the transverse axis with lungs remaining in contact with the chest wall and causing increased tension on the carina and resultant separation. The second theory suggests that with the glottis closed increased pressure within the trachea causes rupture of the intercartilaginous membrane.&#x000a0;The third suggests that rapid deceleration like that seen in motor vehicle accidents causes shearing forces between the more affixed carina and the looser lung tissue.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>Although penetrating trauma occurs more frequently in the cervical portions of the trachea, it can occur anywhere along the path of the trachea and involve any of the adjacent structures. More caution is necessary with penetrating gunshot wounds due to the force of the blast.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>Both inhalation and aspiration cause damage to the mucosal lining of the trachea, leading to inflammation, ulceration, and softening of the cartilaginous portions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r7">[7]</xref></p>

        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>When evaluating a patient with a tracheal injury early detection, proper airway management, and appropriate treatment of the trachea and possible concomitant injuries are key. As discussed previously early detection requires a high degree of suspicion, physical exam findings, and radiographic or bronchoscopic identification. Once a tracheal injury has been identified, the first question that needs to be addressed is what to do with the patient&#x02019;s airway. The ideal method for securing the airway in patients with tracheal injury is the awake placement of an endotracheal tube over a flexible bronchoscope and inflation of the cuff distal to the site of injury. Patients with tracheal injury may benefit from awake intubation in order to limit apnea and loss of the smooth muscle tone. Paralysis for intubation may lead to the collapse of a trachea that is already distorted and traumatized and being held open by the surrounding musculature. In situations where the patient is rapidly desaturating, hemodynamically unstable, and/or awake intubation is not tolerated rigid bronchoscopy with inhalation induction may be the method of choice. This method is especially beneficial if clots, tissue, or strictures impair viewing the area of injury.&#x000a0; However rigid bronchoscopy is more difficult in patients with cervical instability who are unable to extend the neck. Tracheostomy should be considered in patients with concomitant craniomaxillofacial injury or in whom previous attempts at endotracheal intubation were unsuccessful. Additionally, patients with penetrating cervical injuries could undergo the insertion of a tracheostomy tube directly through the site of injury thereby preserving tissue for future repair.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <p>Conservative management in select patients is superior to surgical treatments.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r8">[8]</xref> Injuries best treated conservatively are usually the result of iatrogenic injury, have lacerations less than 2 cm, have no concomitant injury, and can be stabilized without the persistence of symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r4">[4]</xref> Both Fuhrman and Cardillo have established guidelines to aid in deciding if a tracheal injury is amenable to conservative treatment or not.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r10">[10]</xref> For patients who are not good candidates for surgical repair application of surgical adhesive glue for lacerations under 5 mm has been utilized along with stenting.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0; In patients who tolerate jet insufflation and who have membranous posterior wall attachments, an endoluminal repair may prove effective.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>Stenting has become a mainstay of treatment for tracheal injuries.&#x000a0; The two broad categories of stents are metallic and silicone with metallic stents having varying degrees of coating and both classes being offered in straight, T, and Y shapes to accommodate the variety of injuries that can occur. Placement of both classes of stents can be performed by a rigid or flexible bronchoscope. With regards to either modality ensure to secure the airway distal to the location requiring stenting and observe for potential complications. Complications of stents include migration, fracture, infection, biofilm formation, and obstruction with either defective mucus passage, or granulation tissue.&#x000a0; Future advancements in stent technology may yield drug-eluting stents, 3-dimensional printed stents, and biodegradable products to reduce the complications seen with conventional stents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r12">[12]</xref></p>
        <p>Surgical management even in patients with delayed identification of tracheal injury has proven beneficial in restoring lung function and reducing complications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r3">[3]</xref> Location and concomitant injury guide the decision on approach. In general, cervical injuries can be approached through a collar incision.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r4">[4]</xref> Extension of the incision to the level of the second intercostal through the manubrium can provide access down to the level of the innominate artery and vein.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r4">[4]</xref> If exposure of the hemithorax or mediastinum is required a median partial sternotomy or clamshell incision could be utilized but does not provide better access to the trachea.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r4">[4]</xref> For tracheal injuries at the level of the carina or involvement of the bronchi including the middle portion of the left main bronchus, a right anterolateral or posterolateral thoracotomy may be used.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r4">[4]</xref> The distal portion of the left main bronchus could be approached through a left posterolateral thoracotomy if needed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Once access has been obtained to the injured area, carefully debride the wound margins in preparation for primary closure using a 3-0 or 4-0 absorbable suture. Transverse wounds should be closed using a simple interrupted suture. Longitudinal repairs are most amenable to a continuous suture. In circumstances where extensive damage has occurred, circumferential resection with end to end anastomosis may be necessary and except for injuries to the carina is preferred to partial debridement with attempted primary repair. When the blood supply is impaired and there is a concern for dehiscence covering with pericardial or mediastinal fat flaps could be of benefit. In all closures, an absorbable suture should be used with the knots on the outside to avoid granuloma and stricture formation and potential lifelong irritation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>After repair, closed thoracic drainage and negative intrathoracic pressure may aid in the expansion of the lungs and occlusion of the repaired defect.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r13">[13]</xref> Consideration should also be given to head immobilization to reduce tension on repair for 1 to 2 weeks, continued antibiotic coverage, bronchoscopic assisted secretion removal, and incentive spirometry.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r13">[13]</xref> Steroids, proton pump inhibitors, and cough suppressants can also aid in relieving strain on healing tracheal injuries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r14">[14]</xref></p>

Utilization of low-pressure cuffs on endotracheal tubes, correct endotracheal tube size, avoidance of over inflation, and appropriate use of stylets and bougies are a few of the things providers can do to avoid tracheal injury.

        <p>Tracheal injury requires the collaborative efforts of multiple professionals. Care begins with emergency medical services to increase the number of tracheal injuries that survive en route to the emergency department.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30413.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0; This action must be followed by prompt recognition of the severity of the injury and appropriate management of the airway by the emergency staff to help stabilize the patient for further intervention. The extent of the injuries will require elucidation by direct visualization by an otolaryngologist or by review of imaging by a radiologist. For life-threatening injuries not amenable to conservative treatment consultation with a surgical specialist is needed. Many of these patients will require close management within an intensive care unit where pulmonologists and infectious disease staff may work to avoid potential complications after injury repair; this can be significantly aided by trauma and surgically trained specialty nursing staff.&#x000a0; Some patients will require rehabilitation to regain pulmonary function and close follow up to ensure proper healing.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>With 70 to 80% of medical errors occurring due to poor communication and understanding with a vast majority of those occurring in trauma situations, it is crucial to have good interprofessional collaboration.&#x000a0; A Scopic review of interprofessional collaboration in trauma situations found successful teams to have fluid interactions, collaborative leaders, and post-trauma analysis.
