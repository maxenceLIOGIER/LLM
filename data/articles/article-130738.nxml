        <p>The disparity in the healthcare provided to the American Indians and Alaskan Natives is a long-standing issue that continues to plague the United States. Since the establishment of Indian health services, many of these issues have been addressed. However, the disparities continue to exist along with the rise of new issues like heart disease, cancer, and other non-communicable diseases. This activity reviews the history of the American Indian and Alaskan Native community, the etiology and epidemiology of the healthcare disparities, and highlights the interprofessional team's role in bridging this gap in healthcare disparity.</p>

        <p><italic toggle="yes">"The American Indian, once proud and free, is torn now between white and tribal values; between the politics and language of the white man and his own historic culture. His problems, sharpened by years of defeat and exploitation, neglect and inadequate effort, will take many years to overcome."</italic>-<italic toggle="yes"> Excerpt from the speech of&#x000a0;Lyndon B. Johnson, 36th President of the United States delivered on&#x000a0;March 06, 1968, as "Special Message to the Congress on the problems of American Indian: "The Forgotten American"</italic>&#x000a0;(The American Presidency Project- Peters G and Woolley JT, University of California. Santa Barbara).</p>
        <p>American Indians and Alaska Natives (AIAN) are the original indigenous people of North America. Since the Iroquois League of Five Nations (Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca) was established in the 1100s, the individual tribal nations have undergone a series of&#x000a0;upheavals. Since the arrival of European colonists, they became aliens in their own land.&#x000a0;It was not until June 2, 1924, that American Indians were granted full citizenship when&#x000a0;the&#x000a0;Indian Citizenship&#x000a0;Act was signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge. However, it took another 22 years until the US government recognized the sovereignty of the tribal nations. To show gratitude for their service in the second world war, the US government passed the Indian Claims Act in 1946 to set up the Indian Claims Commission that acted as a Judicial arbiter between the US government and the land claims of the AIAN. The last of these claims were settled in the early 21st century. Although it may seem that the tribal nations exist as sovereign nations within a nation, the disparities in economics, literacy, and healthcare continue to be an egregious challenge in the 21st century. These disparities have been further laid bare with the raging pandemic that has come to pass as a defining moment of this century.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Despite the progress being made in recognizing the sovereignty of AIAN people, the stark disparities between the healthcare provided to the indigenous people and the non-Hispanic whites (NHW) have continued to exist. The first arrival of European settlers 500 years ago brought devastating diseases like smallpox, measles, yellow fever to the virgin lands and wiped out multiple tribes over the next two centuries, since the recognition of the right of Indian Nations to health in 1832 (Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall, Worcester v. Georgia, 31 (6 Pet.) 515, 561 (1832), little changed in the health care allotment towards AIAN communities. The federal government continued to provide healthcare to the AIAN community under various treaties, executive orders, and legal bases over the next century. In 1849, the AIAN community's healthcare passed from the war department to the department of the interior.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130738.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;However, little change came about with the transfer of the responsibility. These treaties were broken numerous times, leading to high mortality and morbidity in the AIAN community. It was not until 1921 when the Snyder Act provided a clear mandate for delivering improved healthcare to the AIAN community. It led to a concentrated effort towards providing the healthcare rights of the AIAN community.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130738.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>Post-second world war, under the mandate of "the highest attainable standard of health" from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations, a progressive change began in the Indian health policy. The transfer of health affairs from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to the Indian Health Services (IHS) in 1955 was a pivotal point in integrating the services and administration of healthcare to the AIAN community.&#x000a0;Nixon-administration passed the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act in 1975 and the Indian health care Improvement Act in 1976, which&#x000a0;have been instrumental in improvement&#x000a0;in the health of the AIAN community.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130738.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130738.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>Since the establishment of IHS in 1955, and through commitments shown by various governments in the following years, the health of the AIAN community has improved significantly.&#x000a0;Better sanitation programs, increased immunization rates, increased use of antibiotics, and healthcare provision have reduced morbidity and mortality in the AIAN community. An 82% decline in the infant mortality rate (IMR) is an astonishing feat achieved since the establishment of IHS. Although the morbidity and mortality from communicable diseases have reduced since the establishment of IHS, non-communicable diseases like obesity, diabetes, alcohol abuse have risen to the forefront.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130738.r3">[3]</xref> Several 'social' parameters like poverty, low literacy level, unemployment, etc., remain higher amongst indigenous tribes than the rest of the country. Currently, these social disparities are the main drivers behind the numerous health care disparities seen in the AIAN community.&#x000a0;This chapter reviews the health care disparities in the AIAN community compared to the non-Hispanic White (NHW) group. We also address the AIAN community as "indigenous people/tribe" at various points for this review.</p>

        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>The etiology of health care disparities in AIAN includes both policy issues and personal factors. The personal demographic differences in the community (compared to the NHW population) coupled with the&#x000a0;policy failure that plagued the health care services for centuries have certainly added to the disparities in healthcare.&#x000a0;</p>

<bold>Policy Failures</bold>
</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>The federal government's initial commitment to provide healthcare to the AIAN community was through a series of treaties.&#x000a0;For example, at least 367 treaties were signed between the federal government and the tribes between 1778 and 1868.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130738.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;As the Bureau for Indian Affairs (BIA) changed hands from the War Department to the Department of Internal Ministry in 1849, the vested interest of various lobbyists led to the poor execution of healthcare policies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130738.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Throughout the latter half of the 19th century and early 20th century, BIA worked as a tool to meet the "assimilation" goals of the government without much regard for the healthcare needs of the AIAN community. Despite this, few people worked tirelessly and, at times, aggressively towards the welfare of the AIAN community.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130738.r4">[4]</xref></p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>In the 19th century and early 20th-century, several policies were introduced to improve the living standards of the AIAN community's welfare. However, most of these policies were either misguided or were outright attempts to diminish the sovereignty of the indigenous tribes- For example, the New Deal (Launched during the Great Depression), the Termination era (federal attempt at terminating its responsibility toward the AIAN community), and the relocation policies (relocating returning soldiers to urban areas to achieve a better economic status)- led to the increased burden of healthcare in the AIAN community.</p>

<bold>Demographic Differences</bold>
</p>
        <p>The stark prevalence of poverty, lack of education, and higher unemployment rates in the AIAN community also add to healthcare disparity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130738.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130738.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>

            <p>Poverty and unemployment:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>According to the 2018 US Census, 25.4% of the AIAN population lived in poverty, the highest amongst all ethnicities.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The median household income for&#x000a0;AIAN is $45,448, as compared to $65,845 for&#x000a0;NHW households. 30.5 percent of&#x000a0;AIAN of the age 16 and over; work in management and professional occupations, compared to 42.9 percent of NHW. Also, 21.9 percent of this racial group live at the poverty level compared to 9.6 percent of NHW in 2017.&#x000a0;The scarcity of employment puts pressure on the communities to seek hazardous employment that increases injury and death.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130738.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;</p></list-item><list-item><p>According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics data, in 2018, the unemployment rate was higher than the national rate (3.9%) for the AIAN community (6.6 percent).</p></list-item><list-item><p>AIAN are more likely to live in so-called food deserts, which is a major factor contributing to the high rates of diabetes, obesity, and heart disease in the community. For example, in the Navajo Nation, the second biggest tribe in North America, there are 13 grocery stores and 12 medical facilities scattered across more 27 000 square miles of land. One in three inhabitants does not have access to electricity, and one in three does not have access to running water.&#x000a0;</p></list-item></list>

        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>One of the principal reasons for healthcare disparities in the AIAN population is the community's mistrust in the federally supported clinics. The long history of trauma, ethnocide, and genocide has left a deep void in the minds of the AIAN community that is hard to fill.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130738.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Since the late 19th century, multiple policies were adopted by respective federal governments in an attempt to destroy the native culture and identity. These policies led to the confiscation of land,&#x000a0;banning native language and religious practices, use of traditional healers, etc. that left a deep mistrust in the AIAN community.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130738.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;One of the most vivid practices is exemplified by policies introduced by Captain Richard H. Pratt, founder of Carlisle Indian Industrial School. His motto of "Kill the Indian, and save the man" led to forcibly removing young children from families and put them in federally owned Indian Boarding School, where they were subjected to&#x000a0;the federal government&#x02019;s Indian Education Program, designed explicitly to extinguish Indian cultures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130738.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;These practices continued well into the&#x000a0;early 20th century.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130738.r8">[8]</xref></p>

          <list-item>
            <p>Although the situation started to change after the passing of the Snyder Act in 1921 and the establishment of Indian health Services in 1955, there were still periods when federal policies led to discrimination of the AIAN community. For example, the period between 1946 and 1964 was called the 'Termination era' when the federal government attempted to end its trust relationship with AIAN nations. Congress adopted the House Concurrent Resolution 108 (HCR 108) on August 1, 1953, which was designed to terminate the sovereignty of the tribal nations and impose on the federal authority.&#x000a0;During the Termination period, 109 tribes were terminated, 12,000 tribes lost affiliations, and approximately 2.5 million acres of tribal land were taken away from the tribes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130738.r8">[8]</xref></p>

            <p>The social injustice continued even after the establishment of IHS. Multiple instances of social injustices (like forced sterilization, unethical research, and clinical misconduct in the name of research) have come forth that explain the mistrust of the AIAN community in the federal health services.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130738.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;The most recent of these is the sterilization of American Indian women between 1973-76 by either force or coercion to consent. Several high-level lawsuits like&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Havasupai Tribe v Arizona State University Board of Regents </italic>and<italic toggle="yes">&#x000a0;Tilousi v Arizona State University Board of Regents&#x000a0;</italic>mark misrepresentation of research projects in the AIAN community.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130738.r8">[8]</xref></p>

<bold>Underfunding of the Indian Health Services</bold>
</p>
        <p>The IHS suffers from chronic underfunding.&#x000a0;For example,&#x000a0;between 1993 and 1998, although the appropriations of IHS increased by 8%, medical inflation jumped by 20.6%.&#x000a0;When adjusted for the growth in the AIAN population, per-capita appropriations decreased by 18% for this period.&#x000a0;A level of need-funded (LNF) workgroup created in 1998 reported that the AIAN community's funding falls short by 46% compared with Federal Employee Health Benefits.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130738.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>Federal funding is divided into discretionary funding and mandatory funding. As the name suggests, discretionary funding is at the discretion of Congress and the President. The funding for AIAN healthcare programs is under the category of discretionary funding.&#x000a0;In comparison, Medicare funding comes under mandatory funding. A few illustrative examples of the gaps in the IHS funding are listed here:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Between 1980 and 2002, the disparity between Medicare and IHS funding and spending is glaring.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The growth in the per capita spending of IHS (4.8% per year) lags far behind the growth in per capita spending of Medicare (7.8% per year) and Medicaid (6.9% per year).</p></list-item><list-item><p>The Medicare spending per person grew by $5200, IHS per person appropriations grew by only $1121.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The gap in the IHS per capita spending and the Medicare per capita spending has widened between 1980 to 2002. The gap was 90% the size of IHS per capita spending in 1980, and the gap has increased to 250% by 2002.&#x000a0;</p></list-item><list-item><p>In dollars per capita, the gap between IHS and Medicare widened from $569 to $4448.&#x000a0;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Nothing has changed in 2017 either-According to a report by the National Congress of American Indians, in 2017, the IHS spent $3,332 per patient. In contrast, Medicare spent $12,829 per patient that year, and Medicaid spent $7,789 per patient.</p></list-item></list>
</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>The salaries paid to physicians and allied health workers working for AIAN have never equaled the national average:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The Commissioner of Indian Affairs annual report in 1890 stated that clinicians working in the AIAN communities were paid almost a third of the salary ($1028) compared to the army ($2983) and navy clinicians ($2622).</p></list-item></list>
</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>The above examples demonstrate the lack of resources that have plagued the Indian healthcare services. Although many governments have taken steps to increase the funding for IHS, it remains an underfunded organization.</p>

        <p>Since the inception of IHS in 1955, the agency has been working relentlessly to improve the AIAN population's healthcare outcome. Although communicable diseases have drastically reduced within the AIAN community, the incidence of chronic conditions, cancer, obesity, and diabetes have risen to the forefront. The latest data available on the Center for Disease Control (CDC) website and the Office of Minority Health website gives an idea of the healthcare disparities in the AIAN community.</p>

<bold>COVID-19 and Impact on AIAN community</bold>
</p>
        <p>Each pandemic brings an insurmountable amount of suffering in the world and exposes the fault lines in the healthcare of underserved communities. Historically all pandemics have hit the AIAN community much harder compared to other communities. For example, during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, the AIAN community had four times higher mortality rates than the general population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130738.r20">[20]</xref> Likewise, during the Spanish flu in 1918, natives comprised 80% of the death toll in Alaska. The COVID-19 pandemic laid bare the vulnerability of the AIAN communities. From January to June 2010, AIAN were noted to have 3.5 times higher risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19 than NHW. The risk of mortality amongst the AIAN community was twice as high compared to NHW.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130738.r21">[21]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130738.r22">[22]</xref>&#x000a0;Until December&#x000a0;2, 2020, CDC has reported 4,506 COVID-19&#x02013;&#x000a0;related deaths in the AIAN community. As of Feb 7, 2021, 181 576 cases of COVID-19 among&#x000a0;AIAN have been reported to the IHS.</p>
        <p>The Color of Coronavirus (CoC) project looking at the racial disparities in the death toll from COVID-19 brings out the stark differences in the healthcare disparities in the AIAN community. The latest figures have reported that&#x000a0;1 in 475 Indigenous Americans has died (or 210.6 deaths per 100,000) through February 2021 since the start of the pandemic. This death rate is the highest amongst all racial and ethnic groups and is twice as high as NHW, which stands at 120.9 deaths per 100,000.&#x000a0;As of Feb 2021, the CoC project has reported 4,506 COVID-19&#x02013;&#x000a0;related deaths in the AIAN community. In another study, collecting data between January to June 2020 from 14 states and representing 46.5% of all the AIAN population in the US reported that the age-adjusted COVID-19 related mortality was higher in AIAN (55.8 deaths per 100,000) compared to NHW (30.3 death per 100,000). Although the death rate amongst various age groups increased with increasing age for both AIAN and NHW, 35.1% of AIAN deaths occurred in age group less than 60 years compared to 6.3% in the NHW population. The mortality from COVID-19 on the AIAN community in different age groups is much higher compared to NHW. In the 20&#x000a0;to 29 year age group, the mortality is 10.5 times higher. In the 30-39 years age group, it is 11.6 times higher, and in the 40&#x000a0;to 49 years age group, mortality is 8.2 times higher in the AIAN community than NHW.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130738.r21">[21]</xref></p>

        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>The clinicians and social workers working for the IHS face a special challenge. The mistrust of the&#x000a0;AIAN community in the IHS and the inability to provide comprehensive services due to chronic underfunding raises innumerable barriers to providing care to the AIAN community.</p>
        <p>When approaching a patient from the AIAN community, it is important to pay special attention to their traditions and history. Many patients, especially those living in non-urban areas, use the services of traditional healers. It is important to note this, as a negative approach towards a traditional healer may break the communication with the patient.&#x000a0;It is important to note the&#x000a0;habits of the patient (like the use of alcohol, tobacco, etc.), occupational history, family history.</p>
        <p>As noted above, post-traumatic stress disorder is prevalent in the AIAN community, and the majority of the community reports trauma in one form or the other.&#x000a0;The history of trauma, especially in women and children, must be elicited. In addition to this, every opportunity should be used to suggest and promote vaccinations and cancer screening.</p>

            <p>The ACA allows provisions that help extend preventive care to the AIAN community by making the health insurance companies pay for preventive services, including cancer screening. For example,&#x000a0;when a screening colonoscopy was&#x000a0;not available through IHS, it&#x000a0;was challenging to get one through the contract system. The ACA remedies this challenge and makes the insurance company liable to cover the cost of screening colonoscopy.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p>

<bold>Indian Health Services</bold>
</p>
        <p>The IHS is a federally funded program that provides healthcare to the AIAN community. They provide primary care services and limited dental services to nearly 2.6 million AIAN citizens and descendants. The establishment of IHS has attempted to bridge the gap in the disparities. For instance, since the IHS came into being, the overall mortality rate has dropped by 15 years. However, several parameters in the AIAN community continue to show poor outcomes and reveal the stark disparity in healthcare. In this review, we will discuss the disparities in healthcare for the AIAN community.</p>
        <p>Currently, the IHS funds 41 urban Indian health organizations. These organizations operate in various cities throughout the United States, providing care to the AIAN community that lives in the urban area. Apart from the medical services, the programs also extend dental services, community services,&#x000a0;HIV and sexually transmitted disease education, alcohol and drug use prevention. Apart from this, they also provide prevention services, mental health services, nutrition education, counseling, pharmacy services, health education, optometry services, social services, and home health care.</p>
        <p>When IHS came into being, the disparity in the health of the AIAN community seemed insurmountable. The infant mortality rate (IMR) was three times higher than other races, and life expectancy was nine years lower than the average population. A quarter of all deaths occurred in infancy before attaining one year of age. Maternal deaths associated with childbirth were three times higher than NHW. Infectious diseases like diarrhea, tuberculosis, chlamydia eye infection were rampant. Despite the chronic issues faced by the IHS (listed above), there are some notable achievements of the organization in reducing the disparities in the healthcare of the AIAN population.</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>In the first 25 years of its existence, the IMR dropped by 82%, whereas the maternal mortality rate (MMR) dropped by 89%. By 1992, the IMR in the AIAN community was only 4% higher than the general population, and the MMR was 12% lower than the general population.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Similarly, the death rate from tuberculosis dropped by 96%, and the deaths from diarrhea and dehydration dropped by 93%.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>The AIAN community's rate of improvement outpaced other underserved communities (between 1980-1994, IMR dropped by 50% in the AIAN community, compared to a 25% drop in the African-American community).</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Mortality from dehydration has dropped from 138% in the earlier years to less than 15% in the early 1990s.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Although non-communicable diseases have risen in the AIAN community, the IHS has been phenomenal in implementing a sanitation program and immunization programs that have brought down the mortality rates from communicable diseases.</p>

<bold>Approaching a Patient from the AIAN Community</bold>
</p>
        <p>The approach to the AIAN population is multifaceted. Psychological/Psychiatry support is a critical part of providing healthcare to the AIAN community. It is important to understand the cultural differences that exist amongst various tribes as well the differences that exist in the belief of people from the AIAN community. Although many tribes may have adopted Christianity, their culture is still deep-rooted in their traditions. It is important to understand these differences and apply them when serving the AIAN community.</p>
        <p>The American Psychiatric Association has listed a few steps in approaching patients from the AIAN community. It is important to understand the cultural beliefs of any native/tribe that the healthcare providers are serving. The&#x000a0;psychiatric assessment of a patient belonging to the AIAN community starts by knowing the history of the indigenous people.&#x000a0;</p>

          <list-item>
            <p>Evaluation should be thorough to avoid stereotypes and misdiagnosis. If an indigenous person does not speak the native language, it does not mean that they do not practice their culture. Avoiding stereotypes at all points helps in preventing misdiagnosis.&#x000a0;</p>

        <p>Providers serving the AIAN community must appreciate the cultural differences and the history of the community. Although many of the AIAN community has moved out of reservations into the urban areas, significant disparities still exist in their healthcare and health outcomes. Coupled with the constant lack of resources and funding in the IHS, healthcare disparity tends to increase exponentially. Having a flexible approach towards individual patients may help to navigate tough situations and provide optimal care.</p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>The clinical issues in the AIAN community need to be addressed through a coordinated care plan amongst all healthcare providers, including doctors, nurses, and the supportive staff. The entire&#x000a0;interprofessional healthcare team (clinicians, mid-level practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, therapists, ancillary staff) needs to&#x000a0;understand the history of the tribe they are serving and respect their culture and differences. There is Level 3&#x000a0;to 4 evidence (in terms of historical cohorts, cohort-case control studies) demonstrating an improvement in the care provided to this community when the providers respect the culture and differences in the AIAN community.</p>
