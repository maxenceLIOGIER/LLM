        <p>The Texas Nursing Practice Act (NPA) ensures that only licensed individuals can practice nursing in the state. In addition, other nursing laws, such as Nursing Peer Review and the Nurse Licensure Compact, have been established to regulate nursing practices and establish minimum standards for licensure and education programs. These standards and regulations reassure the public that nursing care providers are qualified and committed to ethical conduct. The rules and regulations established by the Texas Board of Nursing (BON) establish a standard of care for public protection and offer nurses guidance on their duties and the expected scope of practice at each nursing level. This activity assists nursing professionals in gaining familiarity with the Texas laws that govern nursing practice in their state. These laws primarily include the Texas NPA and the rules and regulations set forth by the Texas BON. In addition, participants will also develop an understanding of the Texas BON Position Statements, the Standards of Nursing Practice, and the principles of ethical nursing conduct, which are encompassed within these laws.&#x000a0;</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>The Texas Nursing Practice Act (NPA), enacted on March 28, 1909, ensures that only licensed individuals practice nursing per its provisions. In addition, the NPA grants authority to the Texas Board of Nursing (BON) to regulate nursing practices and establish minimum standards for nursing education programs. By doing so, the Act helps protect the public and assures them that the individuals providing their care are qualified to do so.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Nursing jurisprudence refers to the rules or laws that govern nursing practice, while nursing ethics outline the code of conduct for nurses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-128213.r1">[1]</xref> For nurses seeking to practice in Texas, the Texas BON requires them to know the laws guiding the practice of nursing in Texas as defined in Chapters 301 (the Nursing Practice Act, NPA), 303 (Nursing Peer Review), and 304 (the Nurse Licensure Compact, NLC) of the Texas Occupations Code. Furthermore, nurses at all levels must familiarize themselves with the Texas BON rules, particularly Rule 217.11 (Standards of Nursing Practice), and the Texas BON Position Statements. These regulations and guidelines established by the Texas BON provide direction for a nurse's responsibilities&#x000a0;concerning patient safety, the scope of practice, and ethical standards and professional conduct. The Texas BON Position Statements offer further clarity to the nurses regarding applying BON's rules in specific situations.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Nurses are required to pass The Texas Nursing Jurisprudence and Ethics examination before obtaining their initial nursing license. Furthermore, 2 hours of Continued Nursing Education (CNE) on Nursing Jurisprudence and Ethics must be completed during every third biennial licensing period [TOC Sec. 301.305.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bon.texas.gov/pdfs/law_rules_pdfs/nursing_practice_act_pdfs/NPA2019.pdf">bon.texas.gov</ext-link>, 2019]. A summary of the regulations covered in this examination is provided below.&#x000a0;To access comprehensive and up-to-date information, individuals should visit the Texas BON website at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bon.texas.gov/laws_and_rules_nursing_practice_act.asp.html">bon.texas.gov</ext-link>&#x000a0;and navigate to the Law &#x00026; Rules page.

<bold>The Texas Nursing Practice Act (NPA, Chapter 301)</bold>
</p>
        <p>Chapter 301 of the Texas Occupations Code, commonly referred to as the NPA, serves as the primary set of regulations governing nursing practice in Texas. It establishes the Texas BON and delineates its responsibilities for overseeing CNE, licensure, and practice. The NPA accomplishes this by establishing criteria for licensure, defining the scope of practice for Registered Nurses (RNs) and Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVNs), outlining ethical conduct and professional boundaries, setting requirements for continuing competency, and outlining disciplinary measures in case of non-compliance with these regulations. The main objective of this act is to ensure public safety and the delivery of high-quality nursing care. While the NPA can change every 2 years, such changes require approval from the Texas legislature. On the other hand, the Texas BON may revise its regulations more frequently, given the continuously evolving nature of nursing practice. As a result, nurses are mandated to stay updated on the provisions of the NPA [<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bon.texas.gov/pdfs/law_rules_pdfs/nursing_practice_act_pdfs/NPA2019.pdf">bon.texas.gov,</ext-link> 2019].</p>

<bold>The Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC, Chapter 304)</bold>
</p>
        <p>The NLC aims to facilitate the nursing regulation and licensure process for nurses across multiple member states that are part of the compact. Since its enactment on December 31, 2018, the NLC legally authorizes RNs and LPNs/VNs to practice nursing in other compact states. This compact ensures compliance with nursing laws in each participating state and enables the exchange of information between states [TOC Section 304.0015.&#x000a0;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bon.texas.gov/pdfs/law_rules_pdfs/nursing_practice_act_pdfs/NPA2019.pdf">bon.texas.gov,</ext-link> 2019].</p>

        <title>Clinical Significance</title>
        <p>The state of Texas mandates the NPA, Standards of Nursing Practice, Texas BON Position statements, and Nursing Code of Ethics due to their clinical significance. Healthcare holds immense importance in the lives of those receiving it, emphasizing the necessity of delivering care professionally, compassionately, and ethically. Upholding a consistent standard for all nurses ensures that only licensed individuals who meet these standards can practice nursing. The NPA grants authority to the Texas BON to regulate nursing practices and establish minimum standards for nursing education programs. This regulatory role safeguards the public by ensuring that those providing care are adequately qualified.</p>
        <p>Nurses are responsible for collaborating with the entire healthcare team to ensure optimal care for each patient by coordinating treatment plans and addressing individual dietary preferences. As representatives of the nursing profession, every member must be familiar with ethical standards of conduct, ensuring the fulfillment of nursing duties aligned with the expectations of other healthcare professionals and the general public. Moreover, healthcare professionals from other disciplines may be unfamiliar with the specific educational requirements and responsibilities associated with different levels of nursing licensure. Therefore, nurses should thoroughly understand their practice scope and patient-related responsibilities.</p>
        <p>These regulations and codes of ethics provide valuable guidance to nurses in their provision of care, outlining their duties, the scope of their practice, and the expected conduct. Conflicts and errors commonly encountered in healthcare can be mitigated by having clarity on these matters. Familiarity with the laws governing nursing practice in Texas is crucial for nurses to understand the requirements set forth by the state for their employers. Upholding these standards contributes to establishing high-quality nursing care and promotes excellence within the nursing profession. Each member of the nursing profession must remain vigilant in adhering to these rules and regulations, as it enhances the protection of patients who often find themselves in vulnerable situations.</p>

<p>As an RN, they must provide safe, compassionate, and comprehensive nursing care to patients and their families who require complex healthcare needs. The RN&#x02019;s nursing care is based on the principles they learned from completing their nursing program in an approved school of professional nursing.

<bold>The Texas BON Position Statement 15.28&#x02014;The RN Scope of Practice</bold>
</p>
        <p>As stated in the above Table, the BON recommends that all nurses consult the Scope of Practice DMM-1&#x000a0;to determine whether a job position, policy, or assignment offered by an employer falls within their scope of practice. RNs generally advocate for the patient and the patient&#x02019;s family and adhere to the Texas NPA and BON. The practice of an RN requires specialized judgment and skills acquired through the completion of an approved program of study at a professional nursing school. It&#x02019;s important to note that RNs are not authorized to make medical diagnoses or prescribe treatments.[<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bon.texas.gov/practice_bon_position_statements_content.asp.html#15.28">bon_position_statements/15.28</ext-link>]</p>
        <p>BON Position Statement 15.28 further provides information on the nursing process, highlighting the variations between RNs and LVNs and among different levels of RN education. The nursing process encompasses assessment, nursing diagnosis, implementation, evaluation, and reevaluation. In addition, this process relies on essential skills such as effective communication, clinical reasoning, and the assessment of practice settings to ensure alignment with their scope of practice. For specific details on the LVN scope of practice, please refer to BON Position Statement 15.27.[<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bon.texas.gov/practice_bon_position_statements_content.asp.html#15.28">bon_position_statements/15.28</ext-link>]</p>
        <p>
<bold>The Nursing Process</bold>
</p>
        <p>
<bold>Assessment</bold>
</p>
        <p>The&#x000a0;initial&#x000a0;step of the nursing process is to comprehensively assess and interpret data, which continues throughout a nurse&#x02019;s care for a patient.&#x000a0;After&#x000a0;the assessment is complete, the nurse can utilize the findings to make nursing judgments and determine the patient&#x02019;s physical and mental health status. Furthermore, the RN should also identify the patient&#x02019;s needs and cultural preferences and be prepared to anticipate and recognize any changes in the patient&#x02019;s condition.[<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bon.texas.gov/practice_bon_position_statements_content.asp.html#15.28">bon_position_statements/15.28</ext-link>]</p>
        <p>
<bold>Patient Diagnosis/Problem Identification/Planning</bold>
</p>
        <p>The second step in the nursing process is identifying problems from the assessment findings and formulating a care plan for patients, their family members, populations, and communities using evidence-based practice.</p>
        <p>The third step in the nursing process is planning. RNs synthesize the data collected during the comprehensive assessment to identify problems, participate in the patient diagnoses, and formulate goals. RNs develop a nursing care plan for patients using evidence-based practice.[<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bon.texas.gov/practice_bon_position_statements_content.asp.html#15.28">bon_position_statements/15.28</ext-link>]</p>
        <p>
<bold>Implementation</bold>
</p>
        <p>The fourth step in the nursing process is implementing the plan of care. RNs are responsible for delegating assignments only to individuals with the necessary education, training, skill, competence, and physical and emotional abilities to ensure patients&#x02019; safety. In addition, RNs are responsible for supervising LVNs or other RNs, including directing and guiding their performance and activity.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, RNs may determine when it is appropriate to delegate tasks to unlicensed individuals, bearing in mind that they are still responsible for supervising the unlicensed person and are accountable for their performance.[<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bon.texas.gov/practice_bon_position_statements_content.asp.html#15.28">bon_position_statements/15.28</ext-link>]</p>
        <p>
<bold>Evaluation and Reassessment</bold>
</p>
        <p>The final step in the nursing process is evaluation, which entails the RN assessing patient outcomes and responses to therapeutic interventions. The RN should compare these responses to benchmarks derived from evidence-based practice and research findings and subsequently plan for follow-up care and/or referrals to relevant resources. RNs should also consistently reassess and report the patient&#x02019;s condition, determining the effectiveness of interventions and the need to adjust the care plan.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Essential Skills Used in the Nursing Process</bold>
</p>
        <p>
<bold>Communication</bold>
</p>
        <p>Communication is a fundamental skill used during the nursing process. RNs must effectively communicate verbally, in written form, or electronically with the healthcare team, patients, and their family members in all aspects of patient care. They are responsible for accurately documenting these interactions in the patient record or nursing care plan. Collaboration is essential for RNs, as they plan, coordinate, initiate, and implement a multidisciplinary team approach to patient care. In situations where patient conditions or circumstances surpass an RN&#x02019;s level of expertise, seeking consultation from other RNs or healthcare providers possessing diverse skill sets is imperative.</p>
        <p><bold>Clinical Reasoning</bold>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>RNs must&#x000a0;utilize&#x000a0;critical thinking skills to solve problems and exercise prudent and professional nursing judgment to ensure&#x000a0;adherence to nursing practice standards.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Employment Setting</bold>
</p>
        <p>RNs should ensure that they do not exceed the boundaries of their practice, as employers may not be fully aware of an RN&#x02019;s practice parameters. Before undertaking or accepting an activity or assignment, an RN should assess their capabilities and determine whether they possess the necessary education, training, skills, competence, and physical and emotional capacity to carry out the task safely.</p>

</p>
        <p>
<bold>Professional Boundaries</bold>
</p>
        <p>The Texas BON defines professional boundaries as &#x0201c;the appropriate limits which should be established by the nurse in a relationship with a patient due to the nurse&#x02019;s power and the patient&#x02019;s vulnerability.&#x0201d; [<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bon.texas.gov/practice_bon_position_statements_content.asp.html#15.29">bon_position_statements/15.29</ext-link>] Maintaining professional boundaries involves refraining from inappropriate involvement with a patient and avoiding personal gain at the patient&#x02019;s expense.[<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=R&#x00026;app=9&#x00026;p_dir=&#x00026;p_rloc=&#x00026;p_tloc=&#x00026;p_ploc=&#x00026;pg=1&#x00026;p_tac=&#x00026;ti=22&#x00026;pt=11&#x00026;ch=217&#x00026;rl=1">TAC 217.1</ext-link>]&#x000a0;The NCSBN defines professional boundaries as the distinction between the nurse&#x02019;s power&#x000a0;derived from access to a patient&#x02019;s personal information and the patient&#x02019;s vulnerability. This power imbalance stemming from the knowledge of personal information creates an asymmetry between the nurse and the patient. Therefore, the overlying principle for maintaining professional boundaries is that nurses should refrain from any personal gain at the patient&#x02019;s expense and abstain from any inappropriate involvement with the patient or their family.[<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bon.texas.gov/practice_bon_position_statements_content.asp.html#15.29">bon_position_statements/15.29</ext-link>]</p>
        <p>
<bold>Boundary Violations</bold>
</p>
        <p>Violation of professional nursing boundaries is also considered unprofessional and reportable conduct.[<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=R&#x00026;app=9&#x00026;p_dir=&#x00026;p_rloc=&#x00026;p_tloc=&#x00026;p_ploc=&#x00026;pg=1&#x00026;p_tac=&#x00026;ti=22&#x00026;pt=11&#x00026;ch=217&#x00026;rl=12">TAC 217.12</ext-link>].

<bold>American Nurses Association Ethical Nursing Provisions</bold>
</p>
        <p>The American Nurses Association has also established a general code of ethics that serves as a fundamental framework for ethical behavior in nursing practice, applicable across all levels. These guidelines emphasize the importance of nurses acting as patient advocates, upholding personal and professional integrity, and continually striving to improve the quality of patient healthcare.</p>
        <p>These ethical rules of conduct include:</p>
        <list list-type="order">
          <list-item>
            <p>Nurses should practice nursing care with compassion and respect in all professional relationships, acknowledging every individual's inherent dignity, worth, and uniqueness, irrespective of social or economic status, personal attributes, or the nature of health problems.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>The primary commitment of every nurse is to the patient, whether it be an individual, family, group, or community.</p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>The Texas NPA and BON rules and regulations play a crucial role in assuring the entire interprofessional healthcare team and the public that nurses providing care are qualified and committed to ethical conduct. The regulations set by the Texas BON establish a standard of care to protect the public while guiding healthcare professionals regarding their respective duties and scope of practice at each level of nursing. Nurses formulating patient care plans should collaborate&#x000a0;with the entire healthcare team to deliver&#x000a0;optimal care for each individual. Although&#x000a0;other healthcare providers may contribute to treatment plans, nurses hold a central role in coordinating all aspects of a patient's care. As a result, they often serve as the primary point of contact for both team members and patients.</p>
        <p>Nurses are responsible for communicating with the patient's healthcare team and others involved in their care.&#x000a0;Each communication should be documented in the patient record or nursing care plan to keep the entire healthcare team informed and work toward achieving the best possible outcome. As RNs are responsible for coordinating and implementing patient care plans, effective communication with the entire healthcare team is vital to their nursing practice. Nurses must also advocate for their patients, ensuring their autonomy is respected in all aspects of their care. When a patient's condition exceeds a nurse's level of expertise, they should seek consultation from other experienced nurses or other healthcare providers to prioritize patient safety. Ethical standards establish expectations among healthcare professionals and guide the public in what they can expect.</p>
