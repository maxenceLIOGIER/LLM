        <p>Korsakoff syndrome is a chronic neuropsychiatric syndrome that is caused by the deficiency of thiamine, also known as vitamin B1. This deficiency leads to damage to multiple areas of the brain, which in turn causes amnesia and confusion. Korsakoff syndrome is most commonly seen in the context of chronic alcohol abuse and thought to be on the spectrum with Wernicke encephalopathy; however, Wernicke encephalopathy is acute and often reversible while Korsakoff syndrome is chronic and may be irreversible. This activity describes the evaluation and management of patients with Korsakoff syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>While there is no consensus on the actual definition of Korsakoff syndrome, it is generally agreed to be a chronic neuropsychiatric syndrome due to thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23949.r1">[1]</xref> Damage to multiple areas of the brain leads to amnesia and confusion. While classically associated with chronic alcohol use,&#x000a0;Korsakoff syndrome can be the result of other processes that ultimately lead to thiamine deficiency. Korsakoff syndrome is most often seen in the context of chronic alcohol abuse and is thought to be on the spectrum with Wernicke encephalopathy. Wernicke encephalopathy is acute and often reversible, while Korsakoff syndrome is chronic and may be irreversible.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23949.r2">[2]</xref> When Wernicke encephalopathy accompanies Korsakoff syndrome, it is referred to as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and due to the considerable overlap of the two diseases, this article will refer to both of them when evaluating and treating a patient.</p>

        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>Any condition leading to chronic thiamine deficiency can lead to Wernicke&#x02019;s encephalopathy and, if untreated, to Korsakoff syndrome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23949.r3">[3]</xref> &#x000a0;The most common cause of Korsakoff syndrome is chronic alcohol abuse. Alcohol interferes with GI tract absorption of thiamine as well as interfering with the liver's ability to store thiamine. Additionally, accompanying malnutrition often compounds the effects of alcoholism, leading to further thiamin deficiency. Other causes of&#x000a0;Korsakoff syndrome include eating disorders, chronic vomiting (including hyperemesis gravidarum), psychiatric disorders, chemotherapy, and cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23949.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23949.r5">[5]</xref></p>

        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>The worldwide prevalence of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is thought to be between 0 and 2%. Those at higher risk include the homeless, elderly, and psychiatric patients. Because Korsakoff syndrome is grossly underdiagnosed and there is disagreement regarding precise diagnostic criteria, there is little data on the incidence and prevalence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23949.r1">[1]</xref></p>

        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>Thiamine is an essential cofactor for multiple enzymes involved in brain cell metabolism.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23949.r6">[6]</xref> Without these enzymes, there is a reduction in the metabolism of multiple cell components and ATP. Thiamine mediates pyruvate metabolism, and its deficiency can lead to elevated lactate, edema, loss of neurons, and reactive gliosis throughout the brain. The cognitive deficits seen in Korsakoff syndrome are thought to be primarily due to damage to the following areas- the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, mammillary bodies, and corpus callosum.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23949.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;There is also evidence of decreased glucose metabolism in the cerebral cortex.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23949.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Cerebellar degeneration is also common among alcoholics and can lead to the ataxia and oculomotor deficits seen in Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.</p>

        <p>As mentioned above, Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome are often thought to be on a spectrum with one another as they are both due to thiamine deficiency. Thus, clinicians should screen for them together. Wernicke encephalopathy classically presents with the triad of altered mental status, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia. Less than 20% of patients will present with all three of these findings.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23949.r3">[3]</xref> The following signs and symptoms should cause suspicion for Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome:</p>

        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>Korsakoff syndrome is, for the most part, a clinical diagnosis. It should be diagnosed when the signs and symptoms described above are present in a patient with risk factors for thiamine deficiency. Thiamine blood tests often take days to result and should not delay empiric treatment. Regarding neuroimaging, CT and MRI of the brain are not often indicated for emergent diagnosis of Korsakoff syndrome. However, they may be warranted to rule out other causes of the patient&#x02019;s symptoms. Non-emergent MRI can reveal specific findings of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, including changes in the mamillary bodies, thalami, tectal plate, and periaqueductal areas, but sensitivity is only 53%.</p>

        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>The mainstay of treatment in an acute presentation is thiamine replacement. There is little evidence on the amount of thiamine to replace, but typical regimens include high-dose thiamine at 500 mg- 1500 mg, IV, three times daily for at least 3 days.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23949.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected and fluids replaced. In particular, magnesium requires replacement, as thiamine-dependent enzymes cannot operate in a magnesium-deficient state. Many patients will also need glucose replacement, and traditionally, it was thought that replacing glucose before thiamine could exacerbate the patient&#x02019;s symptoms. Following a review of 19 papers, it has been recommended not to delay correcting hypoglycemia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23949.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;Some suggestions are prolonged and not an acute replacement of glucose without thiamine supplementation and increased risk of Wernicke encephalopathy. After the acute phase of vitamin and electrolyte replacement, there is mounting evidence that memory rehabilitation is beneficial in Korsakoff syndrome. Declarative memory ("knowing what") seems to be most affected in Korsakoff syndrome, leading to many patients requiring lifelong care. Because procedural learning ("knowing how") seems to remain somewhat maintained in Korsakoff syndrome, memory rehabilitation focussed in this area has shown promising outcomes. There has been some success in small&#x000a0;Korsakoff syndrome patient populations in learning procedures and improving their autonomy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23949.r7">[7]</xref></p>

Alcohol withdrawal and intoxication can interfere with diagnosis as well. Even once presented to the physician, it is often misdiagnosed, with one study estimating Wernicke encephalopathy is missed in 68% of alcoholic patients and 94% of nonalcoholic patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23949.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;There are also gaps in research on Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome due to a lack of a formal definition for Korsakoff syndrome, which makes it difficult to accumulate data, especially regarding epidemiology, diagnosis, and prognosis.

        <p>Korsakoff syndrome is a neuropsychiatric condition causing damage to multiple areas of the brain that results in cognitive impairment and amnesia. Korsakoff syndrome can result from any condition leading to thiamine deficiency but is most often seen in chronic alcohol abuse. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is a clinical diagnosis, and&#x000a0;Wernicke encephalopathy should be suspected in anyone at risk for thiamine deficiency who presents with oculomotor findings, ataxia, or confusion. Once amnesia and executive deficits are present, Korsakoff syndrome should be suspected. The key to good outcomes is catching Wernicke encephalopathy early and treating it with thiamine.</p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>Providing quality care for patients with Korsakoff syndrome requires a large number of resources and coordination between a variety of healthcare professionals. In the early stages, triage nurses, visiting nurses, and EMS providers can help identify patients who may be presenting with other complaints or would otherwise not seek care. Practical screening tools in the emergency department or outpatient clinic could help identify alcohol abuse, the major risk factor for Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. In the acute setting, identifying the disease (preferably early on or before the onset of Korsakoff Syndrome) and treating it requires interprofessional work between emergency physicians, neurologists, and dieticians to rule out other causes and treat it. Long-term care of these patients may require the attention of neuropsychiatrists, neurologists, psychiatrists, dieticians, social workers, and the patient&#x02019;s primary care provider to ensure sobriety, continued nutrition, and memory rehabilitation.</p>
