        <p content-type="pubmed-excerpt">Evaluating a patient with cardiac symptoms is a complex and multi-step process. In addition to obtaining a thorough history, a detailed cardiac examination is paramount. In an era where medical technologies advance rapidly, one may think that savvy medical diagnostics such as echocardiography or cardiac CT scan can readily replace a thorough cardiac exam. However, one must remember that a combination of a comprehensive history and a detailed cardiac exam can diagnose almost 80% of cardiac diseases. The decline of physical exam skills in the new generation of physicians is a well-documented phenomenon.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18888.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;A good physical exam can save lives through rapid diagnosis and treatment, as most diagnostic studies take time to result. Here, we discuss the&#x000a0;4 pillars of the cardiac exam: history taking, inspection, palpation, and auscultation.</p>

        <title>Issues of Concern</title>
        <p><bold>Cardiac Anatomy/Physiology</bold>:</p>
        <p>To perform a successful physical exam, one must understand the structural anatomy of the heart. The heart is a thoracic organ confined between the lungs above the diaphragm. It's divided into&#x000a0;4 chambers,&#x000a0;2 atria, and&#x000a0;2 ventricles. The interatrial septum separates the atria, while the interventricular septum separates the ventricles.&#x000a0;The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the superior and inferior vena cava. It then passes through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. Deoxygenated blood transverses the pulmonic valve into the pulmonary artery, which goes to the lungs for gas exchange. Oxygenated blood is then pushed through the pulmonary vein into the left atrium, which then goes through the mitral valve into the left ventricle. The high-pressure left-sided system then pumps the blood through the aortic valve into the aorta and throughout the body.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The pressure of the ejected blood against the arterial wall generates blood pressure along with peripheral vascular resistance. Systolic blood pressure is when the heart beats and is the maximum pressure in the arteries. Diastolic blood pressure is when the heart is relaxing, is the minimum pressure in the arteries, and depends on peripheral vascular resistance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18888.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Blood pressure also depends on stroke volume, blood velocity, compliance of the arteries, and blood viscosity. Heart sounds are typically portrayed as a &#x0201c;lub and a dub&#x0201d; sound. &#x0201c;Lub&#x0201d; is the first heart sound (S1), marks the beginning of systole, and is generated by the turbulence caused by the closing of the mitral and tricuspid valves. &#x0201c;Dub&#x0201d; is the second heart sound (S2), marks the end of systole and the beginning of diastole, and is generated by the closure of aortic and pulmonic valves.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The position of heart valves relative to the chest wall dictates the optimal position for auscultation. The valves are best auscultated as follows:</p>

            <p><italic toggle="yes">Arterial pulse</italic>: When palpating the arterial pulse, the examiner should be able to gather the rate, rhythm, and characteristics. To determine the rate, the examiner should count the radial pulse for 30 seconds and multiply by 2. This process gives a relatively accurate rate unless an irregular rate is present, such as in atrial fibrillation, in which case, auscultation of the heart for the rate should be done. Rhythm should be determined as regular, regularly irregular, or irregularly irregular. Pulse characteristics include contour and amplitude of the pulse. Contour refers to the shape of the pressure wave; normally, it has a steep upward stroke and a smooth downward stroke. For example, a steep and robust upstroke is known as a Waterhammer pulse and is present in aortic regurgitation. The amplitude of the pulse is the highest point of the upstroke. It can vary in congestive heart failure.&#x000a0;When palpating a carotid pulse, always auscultate to check for a bruit first.</p>

One should note if PMI is displaced, as this can indicate cardiomegaly.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18888.r9">[9]</xref></p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p><italic toggle="yes"><bold>Auscultation</bold></italic>:</p>
        <p>Auscultation of heart sounds is the cornerstone of any physical exam. It is usually done with the assistance of a stethoscope. Most stethoscopes have&#x000a0;2 areas: the bell and the diaphragm. The bell should be applied lightly to the skin and is useful in identifying low-pitched sounds such as gallops, murmurs of AV stenosis, and bruits. The diaphragm should be pressed tightly against the skin, and help identify high-pitched sounds such as valve closures, regurgitant murmurs, and systolic clicks.</p>
        <p>The examiner should perform auscultation in&#x000a0;4 standard positions: supine, left lateral decubitus, upright, upright leaning forward. Generally, the examiner should start with the patient in the supine position and listen to all the cardiac areas in the aortic, pulmonic, tricuspid, and mitral regions in the locations previously described for S1 and S2 sounds and any systolic murmurs. While auscultating at the Left lower sternal border, one should determine if an S3 or S4 heart sound is heard. S3 heart sounds can be physiologic in children and athletes but can also be heard in patients with heart failure. S4 heart sound is produced from blood ejecting into a stiff ventricle and is also present in heart failure. The examiner should then turn the patient into the lateral decubitus position to listen for the low-pitched diastolic murmur of mitral stenosis. The patient then turns upright, and all the areas are examined with the stethoscope's diaphragm to listen for S1 and S2 sounds and any systolic and diastolic murmurs.&#x000a0;The patient should then be leaned forward and asked to hold their breath; the examiner should then listen for the murmur of aortic regurgitation and any friction rubs. These sounds are extracardiac, usually originating in the pleura or the pericardium, and have a sound similar to scratching on sandpaper. These may result when these membranes are irritated, such as in pleuritis or pericarditis. Of note is that the examiner should pay close attention to the influence of breathing on the nature and intensity of heart sounds. Most murmurs coming from the right side of the heart become accentuated with inspiration.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>With auscultation of heart sounds, the examiner must be able to identify and describe murmurs. Murmurs can be either systolic or diastolic, so their timing relative to S1 and S2 is crucial. The timing of the heart sounds corresponding to the carotid pulse can help reliably identify S1 and S2. The sound that precedes the carotid pulse is S1, whereas the sound that follows it is S2. For this to work, only the carotid pulse should be used, <italic toggle="yes">not</italic> the radial, as there is a significant delay between the sound of S2 and the pulsation.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>If a murmur is present, the following features require inspection: timing, location, radiation, duration, intensity, pitch, quality, relation to respiration, and maneuvers such as Valsalva or hand grip.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18888.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;The timing of murmurs relative to systole and diastole is critical, ie, a murmur beginning with S1, lasting through to S2, is likely a holosystolic or pansystolic murmur. A systolic ejection murmur begins with S1 but ends before S2. Does the murmur peak, or is it uniform throughout? The murmur of aortic stenosis is classically described as a crescendo decrescendo murmur; it has a peak in the middle.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18888.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;The examiner must also identify in which area the murmur is being heard and whether the murmur has radiation to other areas, such as the axilla, neck, or back. The murmur should then be graded on a level from I to VI. The Levine murmur grading system is the gold standard for documenting intensity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18888.r11">[11]</xref></p>

        <title>Clinical Significance</title>
        <p>In an era of rapidly advancing medical diagnostic technology, it can be easy to overlook history and physical examination. Clinicians must be proficient in these skills to develop differentials and THEN order tests to confirm or refute differentials. Many diseases can be diagnosed solely based on good history taking and physical exam skills. The cardiac examination, in particular, is vital for thoroughly evaluating the heart and differentiating between cardiac disease and diseases of other origins. Furthermore, the physical contact between the clinician and the patient during an encounter can also help create a psychological bond that provides reassurance and generates trust.</p>

        <p>All healthcare workers should know how to perform a physical exam. The cardiac exam can quickly provide important information that can aid in rapidly diagnosing many life-threatening diseases. In the inpatient setting, the cardiac exam should be a part of routine history and physical during admission and should be done daily. In the outpatient setting, the cardiac exam is still the most appropriate method to screen for cardiac disease and establish a diagnosis.&#x000a0;</p>
