        <p>Cancer management during ongoing pregnancy poses a clinical challenge in itself, especially when administering radiotherapy; if indicated, it can severely affect fetal outcomes by hampering overall mental and physical growth and predisposing the growing fetus to malformations birth, low birth weight, and even spontaneous abortions. It comes at the expense of poor overall patient cancer management if aspects of current pregnancy are overlooked while planning treatment. This activity aims to outline the impact of radiotherapy on growing fetus and reviews available literature to highlight clinical aspects of such circumstances to deliver the best care to the mother and child by understanding the role of the interprofessional team's communication with each other and with the patient for evaluating, managing and improving care for pregnant patients who undergo radiotherapy.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Embryogenesis is a complex process and is divided between pre-implantation, embryo, and fetal period. This process is highly susceptible to various external factors such as teratogenic drugs, alcohol, smoking, radiation, and even the lack of appropriate nutrition. Ionizing radiation way more than non-ionizing has known effects in developing fetus with&#x000a0;fatal outcomes.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Malignancy is relatively uncommon during pregnancy, with a low incidence of 0.02&#x000a0;to 0.1%. The most common malignancies found are breast, skin including melanoma, gynecological (uterine, cervix, and ovarian), and hematological (Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20922.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Generally, when rivaled with patients who received surgical monotherapy, survivors who underwent abdominopelvic radiation with or without surgery were more likely to have infants that were premature, low&#x02013;birth weight, and even associated with perinatal mortality in few cases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20922.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Various studies have demonstrated an increased risk of unfavorable pregnancy and neonatal outcomes with prior history of abdominopelvic irradiation, possibly due to&#x000a0;radiation-induced uterine damage. Since high-dose uterine irradiation can restrict the pregnant uterus' growth and cause vascular changes that impair uterine blood flow, preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and stillbirth are common.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20922.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Signorello et al. observed that infants of patients treated with high-dose radiotherapy (&#x0003e;5 Gy) to the uterus were at a heightened risk of preterm delivery, low birth weight, and small for gestational age when compared with offspring of patients who did not receive radiotherapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20922.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;Green et al. observed that the incidence of fetal malposition, early or threatened labor, low birth weight, and prematurity were higher with elevated radiation doses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20922.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>When compared to radiotherapy, chemotherapy does not appear to have harmful effects on the uterus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20922.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;Hence it generally has favorable pregnancy outcomes in patients treated only with chemotherapy. Those who conceived &#x02265;one year after post-chemotherapy without radiation or &#x02265;two years after chemotherapy with radiation displayed no elevated risks to pregnancy outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20922.r7">[7]</xref></p>

<bold>Fetal Risks From Ionizing Radiation</bold>
</p>
        <p>Significant potential harmful effects of ionizing radiation can be summarised into four main categories:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Pregnancy loss (miscarriage, stillbirth)</p>
          </list-item>

          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>While treating cancer in pregnant patients with radiotherapy, the goal is to improve the mother overall survival; however, specific considerations are vital to reduce the fetus's possible adverse implications. Earlier, the norm was to terminate the ongoing pregnancy, regardless of the trimesters. Fortunately, because of the advent of the latest developments of evidence and technology in the last two decades, we have steered away from this blanket policy. Since the 1990s, various technological and technical advancements in modern radiotherapies, such as 3D-conformal&#x000a0;radiotherapy, intensity-modulated&#x000a0;radiotherapy (IMRT), and volumetric modulated arc therapy, have made it possible to give high doses to the tumor while sparing the surrounding healthy tissues or organs in the vicinity, hence improving&#x000a0;radiotherapy in terms of effectiveness and tolerability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20922.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Furthermore, IMRT techniques using on-board cone-beam computed tomography have evolved to ensure a precise dose delivery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20922.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;The detrimental principle of all radiation is that it should be "as low as reasonably achievable" (ALARA) as the effects of radiation are linearly cumulative.&#x000a0;In practice, even though the fetus is excluded from the direct radiation field, the fetus gets radiation leaking from the accelerator and collimator dispersions. To&#x000a0;cut down&#x000a0;this radiation, we use lead blocks and shields to achieve ALARA.</p>
        <p>Childhood malignancy in the context of prenatal diagnostic and assessment X-ray was first reported by Giles et al. in 1956.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20922.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;Their survey of childhood cancers established that the risk increased linearly with the number of films exposed. The relative risk of developing a childhood cancer-associated was significantly higher if the exposure was during the first trimester, about 2.5 times greater than the third trimester. This study became the working model of various radiation-induced teratogenesis studies. A defining study was by Kato et al<italic toggle="yes">.</italic>, where they followed up the survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20922.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;It was the most extensive cohort study of intrauterine radiation exposure; interestingly, only 2 cases had childhood cancer before the 14th birthday out of 1630 children exposed without a single case of leukemia.</p>
        <p>Broadly, radiation effects are expressed as being either deterministic or stochastic.</p>
        <list list-type="order">
          <list-item>
            <p>Deterministic effects have a cause and effect relationship such that below a certain threshold, the effect will not occur. However, once the threshold has been crossed, the effect of significance will increases linearly with every next dose. Deterministic effects on a fetus range from congenital malformations, lower intelligence quotient (IQ), mental retardation, microcephaly, various neurobehavioral dysfunctions leading to increased risk of seizures and growth retardation, fetal death, and increased cancer risk.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20922.r12">[12]</xref> A threshold dose of 0.1Gy has been reported on several occasions. The risks are uncertain between 0.05 Gy&#x000a0;to 0.1Gy and deemed negligible when below 0.05Gy. Pathologically, these effects occur when a large number of cells are irradiated during a critical developmental stage of organogenesis.&#x000a0;</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>The stochastic effect represents the radiation effects that may occur by chance, such as cancer induction. For this to occur, there is no threshold dose observed, and the risk manifolds in a linear-quadratic manner of the dose. Childhood cancers are primarily the result of the stochastic effect, as seen in the post-Chernobyl disaster with the increased thyroid cancer occurrence.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>Ionizing radiation induces these effects by causing structural changes at the cellular and molecular levels. Non-ionizing radiation (which is not associated with medical imaging or radiotherapy) causes damage through heat transfer, such as microwave heating.&#x000a0;Furthermore, by producing free radicals, ionizing radiation causes cellular damage by interfering with chemical bonds between molecules regulating critical cellular processes and events. This process generally leads to DNA mutation or cell death and sometimes causes damage to essential cellular enzymes. Susceptibility to radiation injury depends on the rate of cellular proliferation and differentiation of exposed tissues. Hence lymphoproliferative tissues with rapid cell turnover are the most susceptible, while nervous tissue with little or no cell turnover is the least affected.</p>

        <title>Function</title>
        <p>The American Association of Physicists in Medicine and the International Commission on Radiological Protection described guidelines for assessing the potential fetal radiation exposure during maternal radiotherapy. They recognized three possible radiation sources that need to be evaluated: first, the photon leakage from the machine head; second, the scatter and leakage from the collimators and beam modifiers; and lastly, scattered radiation emerging from the treatment beams of the volume treated within the patient. To reduce the leakage and scatter from the treatment head, beam modifiers, and collimators, lead shielding is placed on the pregnant mother's abdomen and pelvis. Shielding is possible earlier in the pregnancy, but as the gravid uterus grows, it is difficult for adequate shielding. Also, as the abdominal size increases, the distance between the field and fetus reduces, thus increasing the risk of exposure while treating supradiaphragmatic areas. In this circumstance, the fetus receives 10 to 15 times more radiation dose for the same treatment field.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The developing fetus is most sensitive to ionizing radiation harmful effects during the first 14 days post-conception. In this period, either the pregnancy withstands the radiation exposure unharmed or is resorbed, often termed as an "all or none" phenomenon.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20922.r13">[13]</xref>&#x000a0;However, significant consequential damage is seen when exposed during the period of organogenesis (approximately 2 to 8 weeks post-conception or 4 to 10 weeks after the last menstrual period). The embryo may sustain damage due to radiation-induced cell death leading to irregularities in cell migration and proliferation or mitotic delay. Significant sequelae of radiation-induced damage are fetal growth restriction and congenital malformations, particularly of the central nervous system seen as microcephaly and ocular abnormalities, often associated with intellectual disability.&#x000a0;Microcephaly is the most frequently seen manifestation of radiation injury in utero.</p>
        <p>Diagnostic radiology imaging is essential. It is noted that the risks to the pregnant woman of not having imaging or a particular procedure are far greater than the speculated potential harm to the fetus. The fetal radiation dose from various conventional radiograph examinations is below 0.01 Gy. For fluoroscopic examinations, the dose resulting from barium enema might exceed 0.01 Gy, which can be further reduced by proper pre-requisites of the procedure. For a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the pelvis and abdomen, the fetal radiation dose is typically about 0.01&#x02013;0.04 Gy, well below the threshold, which never exposes the fetus to dangerous radiation levels. In general, the doses involved in diagnostic radiology are much lower than the threshold dose for deterministic effects and present no substantial risk of causing fetal death, malformation, or mental development impairment.</p>
        <p><bold>Effects of dose less than 0.05 Gy</bold>&#x000a0;&#x02014; Various diagnostic imaging studies typically expose the fetus to less than 0.05 Gy (50 mGy, 5 rads), which poses no&#x000a0;evidence of an elevated risk of fetal anomalies, intellectual disability, growth retardation, or pregnancy loss.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>&#x000a0;<bold>Effects of dose more than 0.05 Gy</bold>&#x000a0;&#x02014;&#x000a0;This is the threshold at which there is an increased risk of deterministic effects. Evidence suggests that the risk increases at doses above 0.10 Gy (100 mGy, 10 rads), significantly above 0.15 to 0.20 Gy (150 to 200 mGy, 15 to 20 rads).&#x000a0;</p>
        <p><bold>Techniques for minimizing fetal exposure</bold>&#x000a0;&#x02014; A pre-imaging consultation with the radiologist to ensure that the imaging and associated data necessary for maternal diagnosis and management is accomplished at the lowest possible fetal radiation dose. Various techniques are suggested to safeguard the fetus:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p><bold>Non-abdominopelvic plain radiography</bold>&#x000a0;&#x02013; Wearing a lead apron can minimize fetal exposure from radiation scatter whenever non-abdominopelvic sites are being scanned. A combination of fast film/screen or digital radiography can be used to reduce cumulative radiation exposure. Fortunately, diagnostic radiographs of the head, neck, chest, and limbs (ones that exclude the fetus from the imaging field) produce almost no scatter to the fetus. Thus it won't adversely increase the risk of any adverse outcome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20922.r14">[14]</xref></p>

Still, it provides a substantial reduction in radiation exposure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20922.r14">[14]</xref></p>

<bold>Potential Consequences of Fetal Radiation</bold>
</p>
        <list list-type="order">
          <list-item>
            <p>Evidence for the harmful effects of radiation on fetal development emerges primarily from animal studies and nuclear accidents, like the Chernobyl disaster and the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. During the first 14 days post-conception, the developing embryo is at the highest risk, just before the implantation stage. A mere dose of 0.1Gy is enough to cause a pre-implantation death in mice in the zygotic stage. This occurs as an "all or none" phenomenon when a direct exposure of as little as 0.15-0.2 Gy at the pre-implantation stage can cause embryonic death. However, should the embryo survives, there is no increase in malformations, given that they are not exposed to more radiation later.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>As the embryo grows, its radiosensitivity decreases. Most malformations are observed during the brief period of organogenesis, which occurs at about the third to seventh-week post-implantation. This is when the fetus is at the highest risk of growth retardation. The brain develops between the 8th and 15th-week post-implantation. Any irradiation above the threshold during this period can result in mental impairment and impact cognitive functions. Doses below 0.1Gy are unlikely to cause cognitive impairment; however, doses higher than 0.3 Gy would affect higher functioning. Doses between 0.1Gy-0.49 Gy have been associated with a 6% incidence of mental retardation.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>The second trimester (16 to 25 weeks) has risks similar to those in the first trimester, such as malformations, growth and mental retardation, cataracts, sterility, and malignancy; however, the risk is much lower. Mental retardation was reportedly as low as 2%, even with a maximum dose of 0.49 Gy. Miller et al.&#x000a0;reported microcephaly in 2 out of 30 children exposed to doses lower than 0.1 Gy, and 2 out of 44 children exposed to 0.1- 0.5 Gy, for pregnant mothers who had exposure post-atomic bombings during their second trimester of the period of gestation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20922.r18">[19]</xref></p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>In the third trimester, there is the lowest risk of malformation and mental retardation. Miller reported microcephaly only in 3&#x000a0;out of 39 children exposed to a dose below 0.1 Gy and 1&#x000a0;out of 50 exposed to a dose in between 0.1 to 0.5 Gy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20922.r18">[19]</xref></p>

            <p>The fetus is exposed to radiation from doses outside of the treated volume primarily due to photon leakage through the treatment head of the machine, radiation scattered from the collimators, and by beam modifiers such as blocks, multileaf collimators, wedges, and lastly by radiation scattered from treatment beams within the patient. Note that, for photons with energy higher than ten megavolts, there is a possibility of neutron production, which, although small in amount, has a higher bio-toxicity than photons or electrons.</p>

            <p>Advanced techniques are seemingly counter-productive for dose reduction to healthy maternal and fetal tissue because of low dose bath by IMRT or radiotherapy-rotational methods.
