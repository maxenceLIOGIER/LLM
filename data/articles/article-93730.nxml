        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Obstetric perineal lacerations, frequently occurring during childbirth, can affect the perineum, labia, vagina, and cervix. While most lacerations heal without long-term issues, severe cases can result in prolonged pain, sexual dysfunction, and embarrassment. These severe lacerations need prompt identification and proper repair during delivery.&#x000a0;Perineal trauma is common in vaginal births, with lacerations occurring spontaneously or due to medical interventions like episiotomies. The majority of these lacerations are first- or second-degree and usually require suturing. However, severe lacerations, particularly obstetric anal sphincter injuries, which occur in approximately 4% to 11% of vaginal deliveries in the United States, can lead to significant complications like pelvic floor dysfunction and incontinence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-93730.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-93730.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-93730.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>Risk factors for perineal lacerations include first-time childbirth, operative deliveries, larger babies, certain fetal positions, and specific maternal factors such as age and ethnicity. Episiotomies, particularly the midline type, are linked with higher rates of severe lacerations, although mediolateral episiotomies, while harder to repair, can reduce severe tears. Episiotomy use is now more restricted, with guidelines recommending it only when necessary. Most first-degree lacerations do not require suturing unless there is significant bleeding or anatomical distortion. For second-degree tears, continuous suturing is preferred to reduce postpartum pain. Third- and fourth-degree lacerations involve a more complex repair process, often requiring stepwise techniques to restore both the perineal and rectal tissues.&#x000a0;Follow-up care following perineal laceration repair is crucial and includes pain management, preventing constipation, and monitoring for urinary retention. Infection and wound breakdown are potential complications, with long-term issues including incontinence and dyspareunia. Preventative measures, such as perineal massage in late pregnancy and careful intrapartum techniques, can help reduce the risk and severity of perineal lacerations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-93730.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-93730.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-93730.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-93730.r7">[7]</xref></p>

        <title>Anatomy and Physiology</title>
        <p>The female external genitalia includes the mons pubis, labia minora and majora, clitoris, perineal body, and vaginal vestibule. The perineal body is the region between the anus and the vaginal vestibular fossa. The perineum typically comprises the anatomic structures within the pelvic outlet, including the superficial and deep muscles of the perineal membrane, bordered by the ischial rami, pubic symphysis, ischial tuberosities, and sacrotuberous ligaments and coccyx. The perineal membrane is the most common site of laceration during childbirth.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-93730.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-93730.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>Vaginal and vulvar lacerations are typically superficial and do not require repair. However, perineal lacerations can involve multiple anatomic structures; therefore, perineal lacerations are stratified according to severity, whereas vulvar and vaginal lacerations are not. Most clinicians use the Sultan classification to stratify perineal lacerations into the following 4 primary categories:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>First Degree: superficial injury to the vaginal mucosa that may involve the perineal skin</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Second Degree: first-degree laceration involving the vaginal mucosa and perineal body</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Third Degree: second-degree laceration with the involvement of the anal sphincter complex, which can be further classified into the following 3 subcategories:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A: Involvement of &#x0003c;50% of the external anal sphincter</p></list-item><list-item><p>B: Involvement of &#x0003e;50% of the external anal sphincter</p></list-item><list-item><p>C: External and internal anal sphincters are torn&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-93730.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-93730.r7">[7]</xref></p></list-item></list>

        <p>For the majority of vulvar, vaginal, and first-degree lacerations, repair is unnecessary. A Cochrane review revealed that conservative management of small, hemostatic, anatomically approximated lacerations reduced pain, analgesia use, postpartum dyspareunia, and higher breastfeeding rates.&#x000a0;However, evidence of long-term outcomes is lacking, therefore, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has suggested indications for the repair of these types of lacerations be based on clinical judgment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-93730.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The repair technique indicated is based on the degree of perineal laceration identified.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-93730.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Generally, for lacerations noted to have persistent bleeding or anatomic distortion, repair is indicated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-93730.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>Risk factors for perineal lacerations include nulliparity, operative vaginal delivery, midline episiotomy, Asian race, and increased fetal weight.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-93730.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-93730.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;Malpresentation, including persistent occiput posterior position and advancing gestational age, both contribute to perineal lacerations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-93730.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-93730.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-93730.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-93730.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;The most common risk factors for OASIS injuries are forceps or vacuum deliveries, a midline episiotomy, and/or a large fetus.&#x000a0;</p>

        <title>Contraindications</title>
        <p>Suture repair is relatively contraindicated for hemostatic perineal lacerations. Study results have demonstrated that expectant management or using&#x000a0;a skin adhesive results in shorter repair time and reduced pain, with similar outcomes in function and appearance compared to suture perineal repairs. Therefore, conservative management is preferred for hemostatic lacerations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-93730.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;For lacerations with persistent bleeding or anatomical distortion requiring repair, treatment should be delayed if an appropriately trained clinician is unavailable. In such cases, wound packing is recommended, with repair deferred for 8 to 12 hours until an experienced clinician can evaluate and properly address the laceration. This management recommendation is supported by results from several studies demonstrating that clinical understanding of perineal anatomy and laceration classifications and expertise in repair techniques are directly correlated to improved patient outcomes. Results from one study found surgeon inexperience, inappropriate suture choice, and misdiagnosis of the repair type required were the primary factors leading to increased postprocedural complications. Moreover, the incidence of repair failures decreased from 29% to 12% with targeted education.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-93730.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>An episiotomy is a surgical procedure performed at the bedside during the second stage of labor, which causes enlargement of the posterior vagina.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-93730.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;This is done just before the&#x000a0;delivery to decrease maternal blood loss.

Regional or general anesthesia may be considered for OASIS repair. Additionally, betadine or chlorhexidine solution is recommended to clean the perineal area. Surgical glue, suture, needle drivers, Allis clamps, forceps, sterile gloves, sponges, and suture scissors will also be required to complete the repair.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-93730.r1">[1]</xref> The preferred suture material used depends on the laceration type. Monofilament sutures may be associated with a reduced risk of infection. ACOG recommends 2-0 or 3-0 polyglactin or poliglecaprone for the repair of first-degree lacerations, 2-0 or 3-0 polyglactin for the repair of second-degree lacerations, 2-0 polyglactin or 3-0 polyglactin or polydioxanone for third-degree lacerations, and 3-0 or 4-0 polyglactin or poliglecaprone for fourth-degree lacerations.&#x000a0;Depending on the severity of the laceration, access to an operating room may be required.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-93730.r3">[3]</xref></p>

<bold>Third- and Fourth-Degree Perineal Laceration Repair Technique</bold>
</p>
        <p>Proper repair of third- and fourth-degree lacerations is more complex; clinical expertise and correct technique are essential to improve patient outcomes. The particular focus of OASIS lacerations is the reapproximation of the anal sphincter complex and rectal mucosa, depending on the severity of the injury. Once the rectal mucosa and anal sphincter are repaired as clinically indicated, the remaining portion of the laceration is closed in the same fashion as a second-degree tear.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-93730.r13">[13]</xref>&#x000a0;The following procedure is commonly used for OASIS repairs:&#x000a0;</p>

          <list-item>
            <p>Using 3-0 or 4-0 delayed absorbable sutures, anchor the suture distal to the apex of the laceration, being careful to embed the knot within the anorectal lumen.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Suture the anorectal mucosa in a running, nonlocked fashion&#x000a0;approximately 5 mm past the anal verge. Use the overlying rectovaginal fascia to perform a second layer closure over the repaired anorectal mucosa with another&#x000a0;3-0 or 4-0 delayed absorbable suture.&#x000a0;</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>

          </list-item>
          <list-item>

          <list-item>
            <p>Reapproximate the external anal sphincter with 2-0 polyglactin or 3-0 polyglactin or polydioxanone sutures using the appropriate technique based on the severity of the laceration.

<bold>Postoperative Care</bold>
</p>
        <p>Clinicians should closely monitor patients immediately after perineal laceration repair for any anesthesia or postoperative complications. The Foley catheter should be removed on postoperative day 1, and a voiding trial should be conducted to assess bladder function. Perineal cool packs, topical anesthetic sprays or ointments, sitz baths, acetaminophen, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications can be used for pain control. Avoid opiates due to possible constipation. Scheduled stool softeners and oral laxatives twice daily for 6 weeks postpartum should be administered to avoid constipation and reduce the risk of wound dehiscence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-93730.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>

        <p>Managing perineal lacerations during childbirth requires a collaborative, interprofessional approach to enhance patient-centered care, outcomes, patient safety, and team performance. Physicians, midwives, and advanced practitioners must be skilled in diagnosing and repairing lacerations, employing strategies to prevent severe injuries, and ensuring timely intervention. Nurses are critical&#x000a0;in assessing lacerations, providing immediate care, and supporting patients throughout healing. Pharmacists contribute by managing pain relief and recommending appropriate medication regimens to prevent infections. Clear and continuous interprofessional communication is essential to coordinate care effectively, ensuring that each team member is informed about the patient's condition and treatment plan. This cohesive teamwork promotes a holistic approach to care, addressing the physical and emotional needs of the patient, ultimately improving recovery and quality of life.</p>

        <p>Postpartum care clinicians must ensure they are addressing and validating any concerns a woman may have about her perineal trauma experienced during childbirth.

        <p>Women who have had an OASIS injury in a previous pregnancy need to be counseled about the risk of recurrence of injury with subsequent pregnancies.
