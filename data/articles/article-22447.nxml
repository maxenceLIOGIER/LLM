        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Group therapy is&#x000a0;a form of psychotherapy in which 1 or 2 therapists work with multiple clients simultaneously. The American Psychological Association recently identified group psychotherapy as a unique specialty.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22447.r1">[1]</xref> In this setting, the group collaborates to improve each member's symptoms and self-awareness. Evidence suggests that group psychotherapy is as effective as individual psychotherapy;&#x000a0;therefore, this method has the potential to be more cost-effective and widen access to psychotherapy in underserved populations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22447.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Theoretical Approaches</bold>
</p>
        <p>There are many different forms of group therapy, each providing valuable insights into group dynamics and guiding the therapist on when and how to intervene effectively. This understanding is crucial, as a therapist's confidence during the session significantly impacts the overall function of the group, especially&#x000a0;in the initial&#x000a0;group sessions.</p>
        <p><bold>Interpersonal group therapy: </bold>Based on the work of Harry Stack Sullivan and broadly influencing&#x000a0;the other forms of group therapy, this approach centers on the client's desire for secure relationships. Clients maintain parataxic distortions, which are perceptions based on the realities of their past. The group leader's role is to foster cohesion within the group, creating a supportive environment where these distortions can be explored and understood.</p>
        <p><bold>Psychodynamic group therapy:</bold>&#x000a0;This approach focuses on helping clients gain self-insight and upholds the principle of psychic determinism&#x02014;the idea that all thoughts and behaviors originate from preconscious or unconscious processes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22447.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Wilfred Bion first developed this mode of group therapy as an army psychiatrist during World War II when there were not enough individual therapists available to treat service members. The therapist remains nondirective. The group expects that the therapist does the majority of the work.&#x000a0;As frustration builds, the group regresses and exposes the clients' unconscious conflicts. The individual clients undergo projections and transferential relationships that the group ultimately helps them work through.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p><bold>Social systems group therapy:</bold> Based on Ludwig von Bertalanffy's theories, this approach emphasizes the clients' roles within systems, including the system of group therapy and the systems of the clients' families of origin. Groups naturally divide&#x000a0;into subgroups in each of these systems. The therapist focuses on managing and openly discussing boundaries between subgroups.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p><bold>Cognitive behavioral group therapy:</bold> Developed by&#x000a0;Aaron and Judith Beck, this approach emphasizes collaboration to describe and understand the relationships between behavior, thought, and emotion. These groups are highly structured and follow the general patterns of individual cognitive behavioral therapy. This approach typically has&#x000a0;a preset number of sessions and a high degree of psychoeducation.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p><bold>Psychodrama:</bold> Based on the writings of Jacob Moreno, this approach has a designated client, called the protagonist, who writes dramatic performances of their experiences. Clients learn from playing themselves and from playing roles in others' experiences. The therapist acts as the director and helps with writing and casting. As the group progresses through performances, new nuances to the protagonist's experience and the experiences of the other clients are discovered. The protagonist may switch roles with different clients, and the therapist may introduce roles that speak out the suppressed elements of the protagonist's personality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22447.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p><bold>Redecision therapy:</bold> Developed by Robert and Mary Goulding, this approach combines Gestalt therapy and Transactional analysis using a brief series of long sessions that sometimes last 4 to 8 hours. Typically, this is conducted in larger-than-usual groups and focuses on 1 individual at a time. The client is asked about their desired change and the reasons behind it, then tasked with bringing up an affectively charged memory related to this change.&#x000a0;By reconnecting with the child part of themselves, the client&#x000a0;is encouraged to revisit and reverse self-limiting decisions made in childhood. This approach requires highly functional and motivated clients who can tolerate the strength of the regression.</p>
        <p><bold>Existential group therapy:</bold> Based on the works of Irwin Yalom, this approach actively addresses the patient's&#x000a0;existential anxiety, loneliness, guilt, and feelings of estrangement. The therapist fosters openness and prioritizes authenticity. Termination is permanent.</p>

<bold>Creating a Group</bold>
</p>
        <p>Groups often rely on referrals from other mental healthcare professionals, and&#x000a0;a&#x000a0;healthcare professional should ideally have&#x000a0;a wide referral base. Given the logistical challenges, a healthcare professional&#x000a0;running multiple groups should consider hiring a program coordinator. When establishing a group and handling referrals, the therapist must consider several key factors:</p>

        <p>
<bold>Identifying Suitable Clients</bold>
</p>
        <p>After designing the group, the group leader should carefully select clients suited to the group's structure and goals. Exclusion criteria are relative rather than absolute. However, clients in acute distress are unlikely to tolerate group therapy and may have difficulty providing appropriate support and insight to the other group members. Low motivation for treatment, noncompliance with rules, and incapacity for connection with others are relative contraindications unless the group's design accounts for these features, such as with group therapy for antisocial personality disorder.</p>
        <p>Other selection methods for group members include individual interviews, small group experiences, or psychological testing such as the Group Therapy Questionnaire, Group Selection Questionnaire, or NEO&#x02013;Five-Factor Inventory&#x000a0;to determine a candidate client's suitability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22447.r5">[5]</xref> Evidence shows that high extroversion and conscientiousness predict success, and high neuroticism&#x000a0;predicts treatment failure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22447.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22447.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22447.r6">[6]</xref></p>
        <p>The group leader orients the individual members to the structure, function, and goals of the group. The healthcare professional must discuss the group norms regarding fees and attendance with each member.&#x000a0;Proper preparation reduces dropout rates and enhances attendance, ultimately improving group cohesion.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Group Leadership</bold>
</p>
        <p>Healthcare professionals leading group therapy can be psychiatrists, nurse practitioners, psychologists, social workers, nurses, rehabilitation therapists, occupational therapists, or vocational rehabilitation therapists. Group therapy providers use&#x000a0;techniques&#x000a0;that enhance the therapeutic factors that predict treatment success. The group leader fulfills the executive function and guides the group to correct misunderstandings and behaviors. The group leader must demonstrate a strong belief in group therapy as an effective treatment, as clients seek guidance from the therapist in the early stages of the group. The group leader must be optimistic and demonstrate a genuine capacity for caring and empathy so that the clients feel hope and safety.</p>
        <p>As a therapist, the group leader must be self-aware, as the group sometimes idealizes the therapist as a master who may shame them for not living up to expectations. In addition, the therapist experiences both subjective countertransference&#x000a0;due to the therapist's dynamics and objective countertransference due to the group's dynamics, which need to be identified and managed by the therapist. Patients may project their self-representations (concordant identification) or object representations (complementary identification) onto the therapist. Patients may adopt roles within the group such as defiance leader, task leader, emotional leader, and scapegoat leader. As a group leader, the therapist must be aware of these dynamics, as it is their responsibility to manage group anxieties, the boundaries around and within the group, and the safety of the environment.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Therapeutic Factors</bold>
</p>
        <p>Group psychotherapists have identified specific therapeutic factors that account for the improvements observed in group psychotherapy. The practice guidelines&#x000a0;developed by the American Group Psychotherapy Association (AGPA) note the following evidence-based therapeutic factors:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Altruism: Helping other clients in the group fosters a better self-image among participants.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Catharsis: Members of the group experience and then release strong emotions related to their problems.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Cohesiveness: The positive emotional connection between clients is considered a core mechanism of action for group psychotherapy and correlates closely with therapeutic alliance. Cohesion seems to facilitate other therapeutic factors and correlates positively with&#x000a0;clinical improvement. Cohesion can be enhanced through effective group structure, high-quality verbal interactions during sessions, and the group leader's management of the emotional climate.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Intrapersonal cohesion refers to the client's sense of positive emotion about the group.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Intergroup cohesion refers to group-as-a-whole cohesion.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Interpersonal cohesion refers to specific relationships between clients in the group.</p></list-item></list>
</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Corrective experience: The clients re-enact family dynamics in a way that corrects the client's perspective, thoughts, and feelings.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Development of socializing techniques: Clients learn effective communication techniques in the safety of the group environment.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Existential factors: Group members accept the consequences of their actions and responsibility for their decisions.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Imitative behavior: Clients observe other clients working through their problems and, in turn, expand their own skills and awareness.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Imparting information: The client receives information from the group leader/therapist&#x000a0;and the other clients.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Interpersonal learning&#x02014;Input: Clients receive input in the form of feedback from other clients.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Interpersonal learning&#x02014;Output: Clients experiment with&#x000a0;new ways of interacting with other clients.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Instillation of hope: Clients observe the success of others in the group and become hopeful for themselves.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Self-understanding: In the group setting, clients gain insight into their experiences, thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Universality: Clients realize that the other clients in the group have similar feelings and problems.&#x000a0;</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>The AGPA has developed the Core Battery to assist in patient selection, assess therapeutic factors, and track improvements in individual members. Other validated questionnaires include the Therapeutic Factor Inventory and Group Questionnaire.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22447.r8">[8]</xref></p>

<bold>Therapist as Group Leader Interventions</bold>
</p>
        <p>As a group leader, the therapist serves as a monitor and a model of group norms. Therapists should be open and non-defensive; however, self-disclosure should only facilitate the group. Self-disclosure should be judicious and maintain the focus on the clients.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>According to the practice guidelines&#x000a0;developed by the&#x000a0;AGPA, a group therapist has 4&#x000a0;primary functions:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Executive function: The therapist sets the membership, time, subject matter, affective expression, and anxiety boundaries of the group, creating a stable and consistent environment for the clients that fosters group cohesion.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Caring: The therapist must consider the well-being of the group members, which includes monitoring treatment responses and each client's reactions to therapy. This approach sets the standard for interactions within the group and allows client-client relationships to survive later conflicts.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Emotional stimulation: The therapist assists clients in identifying and expressing their thoughts and feelings.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Meaning-Attribution: The therapist assists clients in understanding the dynamics of the group, their fellow clients, and themselves, fostering insight and self-awareness in the client.&#x000a0;</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>
<bold>Group Development</bold>
</p>
        <p>Theorists of group psychotherapy have developed both linear and cyclical models to explain the dynamics of group therapy, with the number of stages varying widely from two to nine or more. In their book&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Basics of Group Psychotherapy </italic>(1994), Bernard and Mackenzie suggested that there are 4 assumptions in most models:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>The pattern of development is regular and observable.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>All groups show similar features as they develop.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Developmental stages are necessarily sequential.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Interactional complexity increases with time, although there are periods of regression.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>The practice guidelines&#x000a0;developed by the&#x000a0;AGPA suggest the following synthesis of models:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Forming/preaffiliation: The group seeks guidance from the group leader/therapist and&#x000a0;feels anxious regarding the other members and the possibility of improvement. The primary task for members in this phase is to affiliate with the group and engage in meaningful work. Clients do not center themselves as agents of change but rather focus on the therapist and external events. The therapist focuses on education, patient commonalities, and encouraging trust.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Storming/power and control: The beginning&#x000a0;of the emotional engagement, the lack of progress, and the dependency on the group leader&#x000a0;or therapist can lead to resentment. This phase often involves questioning the therapist's authority, referred to as the barometric event. The struggle against the therapist often unites the group as members open up to each other. The therapist must remain calm when facing resistance and countertransference, encouraging clients to work on goals, express negative feelings, and connect with one another.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Norming/intimacy: The group has established connections with one another and recognizes the benefit of collaborative work toward the group's goals. There is a high level of cohesion and denial. The therapist functions more as a facilitator than a leader, balancing support and confrontation.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Performing/differentiation: Group members recognize and utilize their individual differences to initiate personal change. They feel more at ease with interdependence.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Adjourning/separation: As the group prepares to conclude, the fear of loss and lack of progress prompt regressions and conflict. The member's appreciation for each other is critical for success at this stage. Members often discuss other losses in their lives and may devalue or idealize the group. Some groups create a termination ritual to contain this loss.&#x000a0;</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>
<bold>Group Process</bold>
</p>
        <p>Wilfred Bion identified 3 basic assumptions that can interfere with the group's work. These assumptions indicate that group members are seeking solutions without addressing their problems:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Dependency: Group members look to the group leader or therapist as a parental figure, hoping to be rescued from their problems.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Fight or flight: Members hope that the leader directs them into conflict with one another or into avoidance of working through their problems.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Pairing: The group hopes that an interaction between 2 members&#x000a0;(or a subgroup of members) leads to a solution&#x000a0;without having to work through their problems.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>The therapist works to keep the group on task doing the work without creating a counterproductive degree of anxiety in the members. Anxiety can be reduced with non-work processes. Work processes with a high degree of empirical support are interpersonal feedback and the client-therapist therapeutic alliance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22447.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>Cohesion and the group's emotional climate have less empirical support for efficacy. Cohesion refers to emotional connections between group members and is a client-client equivalent to the client-therapist therapeutic alliance. A group with low cohesion tends to work against itself, ultimately leading to its own destruction.&#x000a0;A pathological antigroup entirely refuses connection between members. In response to anxieties and tensions, the group splits and subgroups are formed, similar to how clients sometimes fall into specified roles, such as scapegoat, task leader, defiance leader, or difficult patient, within the group. The group leader&#x000a0;or therapist notices, observes, interprets, and manages these roles and groups.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Termination</bold>
</p>
        <p>The termination phase guides clients in recognizing the individual changes they have undergone and prepares them for their future transitions. The group leader&#x000a0;or therapist must help the group members navigate the loss of client-client relationships and the client-therapist relationship. This process facilitates the clients' traversal of future losses. In closed-ended groups, this loss is processed by the group members simultaneously. In open-ended groups, it occurs as members leave&#x000a0;due to achieving their goals or ending participation prematurely. If clients in an open-ended group do not trend towards their goals, the therapist should consider whether the client has formed a dependent attachment to the group that prevents them from working on their problems.</p>
        <p>A premature ending may be due to life circumstances or conflicts within the group. The therapist should attempt to facilitate a referral to appropriate mental health care in these cases.&#x000a0;Proper handling of these events is essential, as the departure of one client can lead to others leaving due to a contagion effect. When the therapist terminates the group, they should debrief the clients on their care, including possible future availability, reminders regarding confidentiality, and handling of treatment records. In addition, the therapist should facilitate referrals to other mental healthcare professionals.</p>

        <title>Issues of Concern</title>
        <p>
<bold>Adverse Outcomes</bold>
</p>
        <p>Adverse outcomes are minimized by careful&#x000a0;patient selection and facilitated by the group leader&#x000a0;or therapist's management&#x000a0;of the sessions. Patients who are unlikely to benefit from group treatment or who otherwise demonstrate contraindications to group treatment should be referred to another provider. Adverse outcomes may result from the behaviors of the group members, as client-client conflict is not uncommon and is not entirely under the control of the therapist. The development of in-group roles, such as scapegoating, may negatively impact the client if they do not have the internal resources to cope with&#x000a0;this, for example,&#x000a0;socially isolated patients or those in an acute crisis. The therapist should help each group member voice their concerns and limit judging others. Other significant adverse outcomes are negative emotional experiences, treatment failure, and failure to maintain confidentiality.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Ethics</bold>
</p>
        <p>Group therapy is unique because clients play a role in treating their peers. As a result, confidentiality can be a challenging issue to navigate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22447.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;The degree of confidentiality required in groups&#x000a0;varies based on jurisdiction and state. This topic should be addressed in the preparation stage with individual group members as a part of the informed consent process, and each client should sign a confidentiality agreement. Child and adolescent patients should know what can&#x000a0;be disclosed to their parents or guardians. There should be clear and established consequences for a group member who violates the group's confidentiality.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The group leader&#x000a0;or therapist should document objectively, focusing on each client's problems and the therapist's interventions with&#x000a0;that client. Documentation about individual group members must not include identifying information about others&#x000a0;in the group.</p>

        <p>Some clients may be simultaneously involved in other therapies, such as individual psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy, with various healthcare professionals, including social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, nurse practitioners, nurses, and rehabilitation therapists. Some treatment programs for more seriously ill patients may require participation in multiple modalities, including occupational therapy, rehabilitation therapy, vocational rehabilitation, and substance use treatment. This comprehensive approach enhances the client's treatment experience, provides essential support, and expands the range of issues that can be addressed.&#x000a0;</p>

            <p>Combined therapy: When a therapist serves as both the group leader and the individual therapist for a client,&#x000a0;it fosters a deeper relationship between the therapist and the client. However, this may also raise concerns among group members about potential favoritism, underscoring the need for clear boundaries. Some therapists choose to maintain a combined relationship with all group members, but this can lead to triangulation between the therapist&#x000a0;and group members in conflict with each other<bold>.</bold> There is also the risk of accidentally disclosing information in the group that was shared in individual therapy.</p>

            <p>Conjoined therapy: When a client has a group leader&#x000a0;or therapist and a separate individual therapist, regular and high-quality communication between the therapists is essential. Clients may elicit reactions from one therapist that impede the work being done with the other therapist, leading to triangulation. For example, a client may tell the individual therapist about the dynamics in group therapy and use the individual therapist's reaction to justify behaviors in group therapy. Both therapists must obtain releases of information to facilitate this process.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22447.r27">[27]</xref></p>

            <p>Pharmacotherapy: Clients often receive pharmacotherapy for their psychiatric symptoms. The therapist should obtain the patient's medication history during intake as germane to treatment and the patient's function within the group, for example, if the patient is sedated during the group or decompensates. If the healthcare professional is also responsible for prescribing medication, they should schedule individual appointments to monitor the efficacy and adverse effects of the drug. As the group therapy concludes, the healthcare professional&#x000a0;should arrange ongoing individual appointments or transition care to another healthcare professional&#x000a0;to ensure continuity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22447.r28">[28]</xref></p>

        <p>Lastly, care coordination is pivotal in ensuring seamless and efficient patient care. Clinicians, advanced practitioners, social workers, occupational therapists, rehabilitation therapists, and other healthcare providers&#x000a0;must collaborate to streamline the patient's journey, from diagnosis through treatment and follow-up. This coordination minimizes errors, reduces delays, and enhances patient safety, ultimately leading to improved outcomes and patient-centered care that prioritizes well-being and satisfaction.</p>
