        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>White blood cells, or leukocytes (Greek; leucko=white and cyte=cell), are part of the immune system and participate in innate and humoral immune responses. They circulate in the blood and mount inflammatory and cellular responses to injury or pathogens.&#x000a0;</p>

      <sec id="article-31353.s2" sec-type="Structure">
        <title>Structure</title>
        <p>Leukocytes can be classified as granulocytes and agranulocytes based on&#x000a0;the presence and absence of microscopic granules in their cytoplasm when stained with Giemsa&#x000a0;or Leishman stains.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Granulocytes&#x000a0;</bold>
</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils are all granulocytes. These cells also all have azurophilic granules (lysosomes) and specific granules that contain substances unique to each cell's function. Histologically, granulocytes&#x000a0;can be distinguished from&#x000a0;1 another by their nucleus's morphology, size, and how their granules stain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-31353.r1">[1]</xref></p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Neutrophils are 12&#x000a0;to 15 &#x000b5;m in diameter and have multi-lobed&#x000a0;nuclei typically consisting of 3&#x000a0;to 5 segments joined by thin strands or isthmuses. Thus, they are also called polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Neutrophils contain specific granules in the cytoplasm that cannot be resolved by light microscopy, giving the cytoplasm a pale pink color. When activated, neutrophils migrate into the tissues via diapedesis. These cells have life spans of a few days, and when activated in connective tissue, they undergo apoptosis and are then removed by macrophages.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Eosinophils have a bi-lobed nucleus with large cytoplasmic specific granules that are eosinophilic, staining red to pink.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Basophils are 12&#x000a0;to15 &#x000b5;m in diameter, have bi-lobed or S-shaped nuclei, and contain cytoplasmic specific granules (0.5 &#x000b5;m) in diameter that stain blue to purple. The basophilia of the granules is due to the presence of heparin and sulfated glycosaminoglycans. These cells have similar functions as mast cells.&#x000a0;</p>

<bold>Agranulocytes</bold>
</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Agranulocytes consist of lymphocytes and monocytes, and while they lack specific granules, they do contain azurophilic granules. Monocytes are precursor cells for the mononuclear phagocytic system, which includes cells such as macrophages, osteoclasts, and microglial cells in connective tissue and organs. These cells constitute 4 to 8% of white blood cells, are 12 to 15 &#x000b5;m in diameter, and have large nuclei that are indented or C&#x02014;C-shaped, which can be eccentric. There is abundant cytoplasm, and the lysosomal granules at the resolution of the light microscope give the cytoplasm a bluish-gray color.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Lymphocytes constitute approximately 25% of white blood cells, are of varying sizes, and have spherical nuclei. The small lymphocytes are similar in size to red blood cells, have spherical heterochromatic nuclei, and scant cytoplasm. Larger lymphocytes, such as activated lymphocytes, have indented nuclei and are 9&#x000a0;to 18 &#x000b5;m in diameter with more cytoplasm containing azurophilic granules. Lymphocytes subdivide into several groups using the cluster of differentiation (CD) markers. The major groups are B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes.</p>

        <title>Function</title>
        <p>All white blood cells or leukocytes are involved in immune system function; however, the specific roles and functions vary for each blood cell type.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Diapedesis (also called Extravasation or Leukocyte Adhesion Cascade)</bold>
</p>
        <p>Leukocyte migration to sites of injury or infection is mediated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) present on&#x000a0;microbes&#x000a0;and damaged tissue, respectively. Local inflammatory cells, such as macrophages and mast cells,&#x000a0;detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and release cytokines to signal leukocytes to migrate out of circulation. Histamine and heparin released by perivascular mast cells aid in opening intracellular junctions between the capillary endothelial cells. Furthermore, endothelial cells secrete chemoattractants and express surface markers, including selectins, integrin, and cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs) on their lumen that cause leukocyte adhesion, rolling, arrest, and eventual migration into the affected tissues.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Myeloid</bold>
</p>
        <p>Myeloid cells include the leukocyte (granulocyte, monocyte) and erythrocytic (red blood cell) lineages but do not include the lymphoid cell lineages.</p>
        <p>Neutrophils&#x000a0;comprise 50% to 70% of circulating leukocytes and represent the body's initial line of defense. They are involved in the acute inflammatory response to bacterial infection and the removal of the bacteria by phagocytosis. They are also the most numerous cells to arrive at the site of injury or infection. There, they undergo diapedesis at the site of infection or injury. They then recognize foreign antigens on bacteria, infectious agents, dead cells, and debris via various membrane receptors. These are then phagocytosed and degraded by enzymes within intracellular phagolysosomes. Specific and azurophilic granules containing myeloperoxidase fuse with the lysosome, with respiratory bursts resulting in the generation of reactive oxygen species and degradation of bacteria within the phagolysosomes.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Basophils have similar functions to mast cells and supplement their activity. They make up less than 1% of all leukocytes. Their primary function is inflammation and allergic reaction. Basophils have a high affinity for binding IgE antibodies on their surface. Antigens (allergens) binding to the IgE on the basophil surface results in degranulation and release of substances such as mediators of inflammation like histamine, eosinophil chemotactic factor, platelet-activating factor, and phospholipase A.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-31353.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-31353.r3">[3]</xref> These agents cause the symptoms of allergies and, in extreme cases, hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis. Of note, basophils have almost no phagocytic abilities.</p>
        <p>Eosinophils make up about 1&#x000a0;to 4% of the leukocytes on average. They are involved in chronic inflammation, allergic reactions, and host deference against parasitic infections. They also modulate potentially deleterious effects of inflammatory vasoactive mediators. This modulatory effect is via specific substances, arylsulfatase, and histaminase, enzymes that decompose leukotrienes and histamine. Eosinophils combat parasitic infections by releasing their specific granules, of which the cationic protein, a major basic protein, has toxicity against helminth parasites.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-31353.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;Last, like neutrophils and basophils, eosinophils are phagocytic; however, they commonly clear antigen-antibody complexes.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Monocytes make up between 2% to 8% of leukocytes. They differentiate and only become functional once they leave the blood. Once in the tissues, they differentiate into cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system, such as macrophages (in the lung, connective tissue and lymphatic tissues, and bone), osteoclasts, and Kupffer cells. They phagocytose bacteria, cells, and debris and function as antigen-presenting cells there.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Lymphoid</bold>
</p>
        <p>Lymphocytes are agranulocytes, comprising 20% to 40% of the leukocyte count, and are part of the adaptive immune system. They are circulating immunocompetent cells that develop the ability to recognize and react to antigens and are in transit from and to various lymphatic tissues.</p>

        <p>Blood smear slides are most often visualized with Giemsa or Leishman's stains, which allows for the coloration of cell contents and granules as basophilic (blue) or eosinophilic (red) and the subsequent histological identification of the different leukocytes.</p>

        <p>The abundance of the granules in the cytoplasm characterizes the ultrastructure of granulocytes. Azurophilic granules are present in all granulocytes and also in monocytes and lymphocytes. The neutrophil-specific granules are smaller, less electron-dense, more numerous, and rounded than the azurophilic granules. The specific granules of the eosinophils are oval, electron-dense, characterized by having a central crystalloid formed of major basic proteins.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-31353.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;The basophils have larger and irregularly shaped granules, which are less in number.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-31353.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>

        <title>Clinical Significance</title>
        <p>
<bold>Labs</bold>
</p>
        <p>Clinically, the complete blood count (CBC) test measures leukocytes. A CBC is frequently ordered to provide&#x000a0;insight into disease processes and includes measurements of the leukocyte red blood cell and platelet totals (see <bold>Illustration.</bold> Illustration of Red Blood Cell, Platelet, and White Blood Cell). Often associated with the CBC is a differential, which refers to the relative amounts of white blood cell types (ie, neutrophil, lymphocyte, eosinophil, etc) as a percentage of the total number of WBCs.&#x000a0;Of note, if a subtype of white blood cells seems to be elevated based on the differential, the actual value of the type of white blood cells should be calculated by multiplying the percentage listed on the differential by the total number of white blood cells.</p>
        <p>The normal range of white blood cell values is 4,000 to 11,000/&#x000b5;L. Anything below this range is leukopenia and anything above this range qualifies as leukocytosis.</p>
        <p>A peripheral blood smear is an additional optional test that allows for the histological analysis of the peripheral blood. This test is particularly helpful in cases of leukopenia or if there is a concern for leukemia or lymphoma.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Leukopenia</bold>
</p>
        <p>This condition is where the leukocyte counts are lower than normal. Leukopenia can occur with viral infections and other conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Leukocytosis</bold>
</p>
        <p>This condition occurs when the leukocyte counts (primarily neutrophils) are higher than normal, accompanied by a &#x0201c;left shift&#x0201d; or an increase in immature cells in the blood. Leukocytosis is commonly a sign of an inflammatory response, such as infection, but it can also occur during parasitic infections or cancers, such as leukemia. Neutrophils can also become elevated due to other conditions, such as stress.</p>
