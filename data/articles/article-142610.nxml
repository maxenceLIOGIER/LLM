        <p>Glucose is the&#x000a0;most abundant&#x000a0;carbohydrate in peripheral circulation, and blood glucose is the most common analysis done in the clinical laboratory.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-142610.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The body actively maintains blood glucose levels between 80&#x000a0;to 120 mg/dl through&#x000a0;metabolic processes such as gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, glycolysis, and glycogenesis. Gluconeogenesis is an anabolic pathway that synthesizes glucose from amino acids and other molecules, while glycogenolysis is a catabolic pathway involved in the breakdown of glycogen into glucose for energy use.</p>
        <p>These pathways are activated when the body signals an increased demand for glucose and are mediated&#x000a0;mainly by the hormone&#x000a0;glucagon. Conversely, glycolysis is a catabolic process that breaks down glucose, and glycogenesis is an anabolic process involved in the buildup of glycogen from glucose molecules. These pathways are activated when the body needs to reduce blood glucose levels, such as after a heavy meal, and are mediated mainly by the hormone insulin. When the body's regulatory hormones fail to maintain glucose levels,&#x000a0;high blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) and low blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia) can occur.</p>
        <p>In metabolic conditions such as diabetes mellitus, blood glucose is no longer&#x000a0;maintained within normal limits, and thus patients need medications for glycemic control. The prevalence of diabetes in the U.S. is estimated to be 22.3 million adults, with over 90% of cases attributed to type II diabetes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-142610.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Diabetes is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide; however, hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia are seen in several other medical conditions. Accurate measurements of blood glucose are essential in the screening, diagnosing, and monitoring patients with a wide variety of metabolic conditions.</p>
        <p>Glucose oxidase is one of the most widely used enzymes for glucose detection because of its ability to reduce oxygen to hydrogen peroxide&#x000a0;(H2O2) while also oxidizing glucose to gluconic acid. At neutral pH, glucose exists in two forms, &#x003b1;-D-glucose and &#x003b2;-D-glucose.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-142610.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;As the &#x003b2;-D-glucose is consumed in the reaction, the equilibrium of the two isomers of glucose is maintained by shifting production towards &#x003b2;-D-glucose, which allows glucose oxidase to act on all the glucose in the solution.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-142610.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>One way of measuring blood glucose in the laboratory is by using the&#x000a0;glucose oxidase-peroxidase (GOD-POD) method. The principle of the&#x000a0;GOD-POD reaction is as follows: glucose is oxidized to gluconic acid while oxygen is simultaneously reduced to hydrogen peroxide by the enzyme glucose oxidase. Hydrogen peroxide is then split to form water and nascent oxygen by the enzyme peroxidase. That nascent oxygen reacts with 4-aminoantipyrine, and in the presence of phenol, this reaction produces quinoneimine, which is a colored compound that can&#x000a0;be&#x000a0;analyzed using colorimetric analysis. The intensity of the color produced correlates directly to the concentration of glucose in the sample.&#x000a0;The&#x000a0;colorimetric analysis is performed&#x000a0;at 505 nm and compared to the standard, which is treated similarly.</p>

        <title>Specimen Requirements and Procedure</title>
        <p>A&#x000a0;blood sample is drawn into a sodium fluoride vial for testing. Sodium fluoride inhibits the glycolytic enzyme enolase present in red blood cells (RBCs), and thus&#x000a0;its anti-glycolytic effects prevent a falsely low blood glucose value. Plasma is then obtained by centrifuging the blood sample for 10 minutes at 2000 rpm.&#x000a0;When calculating blood glucose concentration, it is important to note that the concentration of glucose in whole blood is estimated to be 10&#x000a0;to 15% lower than the glucose concentration in plasma. The glucose concentration in the water content of the plasma is equal to the concentration of glucose in the water content of RBCs. The plasma, however, has greater water content and therefore has a greater glucose concentration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-142610.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;It is important to obtain the glucose concentration from the plasma for a more accurate blood glucose reading. &#x000a0;</p>

        <title>Testing Procedures</title>
        <p>Enzymatic methods&#x000a0;are the most widely used methods for glucose analysis; however, other methods for glucose quantification include reducing and condensation methods. The least specific of these methods is the reducing method. This technique utilizes the reducing ability of glucose to reduce metals, such as copper, which yields a color change in the solution. The downfall of this method is that numerous reducing agents can interfere with the estimation of glucose and produce a significantly falsely elevated result.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-142610.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>Condensation methods utilize the aldehyde group of glucose, which can react with aromatic compounds, such as o-toluidine, to form glucosamine that produces a green color. The color is then measured to yield an estimation of the glucose concentration in the sample. However, other aldoses can cross-react and cause inaccurate results.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-142610.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>Enzymatic methods, like the GOD-POD and hexokinase methods, are the most widely used methods for glucose estimation in the laboratory. The hexokinase method, in particular, is a highly specific modality for determining plasma glucose. The enzymatic method yields NADH through hexokinase-catalyzed transformations of glucose. NADH is then analyzed using spectrophotometry to determine the glucose concentration in the sample.</p>

        <p>High levels of reducing agents such as uric acid, vitamin C, and bilirubin may affect results. 4-aminoantipyrine, a component of the GOD-POD reaction, is an oxidizing agent that can neutralize excess reducing substances in the bloodstream and prevent interference with the coloring agent, phenol. Other potential interfering substances include excess triglycerides, abnormal hematocrit levels, and various drugs and medications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-142610.r6">[6]</xref></p>

        <title>Results, Reporting, and Critical Findings
</title>
        <p>Generally, a normal fasting blood glucose range is between 70-99 mg/dL, a&#x000a0;fasting blood glucose range of 100&#x000a0;to 125 mg/dL indicates pre-diabetes,&#x000a0;and&#x000a0;a fasting blood glucose of &#x0003e;125 mg/dL indicates diabetes. However, there are slight variations in reference ranges between different laboratories, and the reference values of the facility where the test was&#x000a0;performed should be used.&#x000a0;To calculate a patient's blood glucose level using the GOD-POD method, the optical density of the Test, Standard, and Blank are taken.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>(OD of Test- OD blank) x Conc. Standard) /&#x000a0;(OD of Standard - OD blank)</p>
        <p>The optical density of the blank should equal zero, and thus the formula is simplified to:</p>
        <p>(OD of Test&#x000a0;x Conc. Standard) /&#x000a0;OD of Standard</p>
        <p>The optical density of the test is divided by the optical density of the standard, and the value obtained is then multiplied by the known glucose concentration of the mean (100mg/dL). The value obtained from this calculation is the glucose concentration of the test sample.&#x000a0;</p>

        <title>Clinical Significance</title>
        <p>Glucose is derived from the breakdown of carbohydrates, and its availability is essential for providing energy to the human body.&#x000a0;The body tightly controls glucose within a normal, healthy range&#x000a0;through endocrine hormones such as insulin and glucagon. Other hormones that can significantly affect glucose levels are cortisol, epinephrine, and thyroid hormone. When symptoms of&#x000a0;abnormally controlled blood glucose&#x000a0;bring a patient to seek medical attention, a blood glucose measurement is an essential aspect of data collection to determine the pathology and treatment of the condition.</p>
        <p>Some physiological conditions associated with hyperglycemia include a high carbohydrate diet, anxiety, emotional stress, and pregnancy. Pathological conditions associated with hyperglycemia include hyperpituitarism, hyperthyroidism, hyperadrenalism, and diabetes mellitus.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Diabetes mellitus can further be subdivided into type I and type II. Type I diabetes is due to autoimmune destruction of the beta-cells within the pancreas and tends to occur early in life. The beta-cells are responsible for insulin secretion; thus, in type 1 diabetes, there is an absolute insulin deficiency. Type II diabetes is more of a progressive loss of function of the beta-cells and is mainly due to insulin resistance. It typically occurs in adults with risk factors such as obesity, sedentary lifestyles, and a family history of the disease. Chronically elevated glucose levels can lead to microvascular damage within the kidneys, the eyes, and the peripheral nerves; this damage can manifest as nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Hyperpituitarism, hyperthyroidism, and hyperadrenalism are disorders in which aberrant hormonal signaling within the body increases the breakdown of molecules into glucose or increases the production of glucose. Although the&#x000a0;pathophysiology of these disorders is different than diabetes, one of their manifestations is abnormally elevated blood glucose, and thus accurate measurements of glucose levels aid in the clinical diagnosis. &#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Hypoglycemia can also be physiological, as would be seen in starvation and after excessive, strenuous exercise. Pathological conditions associated with hypoglycemia include insulin overdose or an insulin-secreting tumor, hypothyroidism, hypopituitarism, and Addison&#x000a0;disease. Excess insulin causes the body to uptake too much glucose from the blood and thus causes hypoglycemia. Hypothyroidism, hypopituitarism, and Addison disease are all disorders in which the body&#x02019;s endocrine hormones that signal the body&#x02019;s organs to increase blood glucose are lacking. Although other symptoms are associated with these diseases, hypoglycemia is a common and clinically relevant finding.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Just as well-controlled blood glucose is essential for overall health, accurate glucose measurements are crucial for a clinician to provide the best care to a patient.&#x000a0;</p>

</title>
        <p>Using a blank test and a standard (or control) with a known glucose concentration allows for accurate results independent of the technical faults with the colorimeter or instruments used in the analysis. Each test performed on an unknown sample should include samples with normal and abnormal glucose concentrations to allow for appropriate quality control. If the results of the controls are not consistent with what was expected, be sure to check the procedure, the colorimeter, and the instruments used for the analysis.&#x000a0;</p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>Interdisciplinary collaboration is essential when planning and managing a patient's medical condition. If a patient is hyperglycemic, laboratory studies are necessary for the clinician to properly treat the abnormally elevated blood glucose levels. Based on the lab's objective data, the clinician can then dose the insulin, fluids, and electrolytes to the patient's current status. The role of the nurse is essential in carrying out the clinician's orders of the insulin prescribed and carefully monitoring the patient's vital signs to ensure that the patient is responding appropriately. In addition to medical therapy, a registered dietitian can provide nutritional therapy to help patients manage their blood glucose and possibly prevent another hospitalization. As with all medical conditions, collaboration and communication between clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), nurses, laboratory clinicians, and all other disciplines involved in patient care is essential to prevent medical errors and enhance patient experience and outcomes.
