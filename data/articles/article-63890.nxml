        <p>Teledebriefing describes a process in which learners participating in a simulation scenario undergo debriefing with a facilitator at an off-site location.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The concept of educating or training learners at an off-site location is a relatively new niche in the field of medical simulation, called telesimulation. Specifically, telesimulation is a process by which telecommunication and simulation resources are utilized to provide education, training, or assessment to learners off-site.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Although literature describes the use of simulation and telecommunication resources for medical education, there has not been a unified definition of telesimulation until recently. In 2016, the International Meeting on Simulation in Healthcare introduced a new comprehensive and unifying definition to the simulation community. It encompasses all the areas utilizing telecommunication and simulation resources for education &#x00026; training that had been used in the past while allowing for future growth in all learning domains.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Telesimulation has seen rapid growth in the last several years and has been implemented in many areas, including (but not limited to) pediatric resuscitation, surgery, anesthesia, nursing, and emergency medicine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r3">[3]</xref> The benefits of using telesimulation in medical education are many and include the ability to educate and train learners at an off-site location; the ability to assess learners at an off-site location eliminates distance and time barriers to content delivery, allows for interinstitutional networking and collaboration, and can provide significant cost savings to individuals, programs, and institutions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>

        <p>Research has shown that simulation is a superior educational modality to passive methods such as didactic lectures for critical care conditions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r8">[8]</xref> As such, simulation is becoming increasingly incorporated into medical education.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;However, there is a paucity or absence of simulation resources in many areas of the world, limiting the benefits of simulation in resource-poor&#x000a0;or restricted areas.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;Furthermore, at teaching institutions with simulation facilities, the number of qualified instructors that can facilitate postsimulation debriefing may be inadequate, limiting the benefits of simulation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;An emerging solution to this problem is telesimulation.</p>
        <p>Utilizing telesimulation with teledebriefing, facilities lacking faculty resources may gain access to simulation education using basic equipment and a simple Internet connection.

        <p>Teledebriefing can be accomplished cost-effectively and straightforwardly using basic equipment and an Internet connection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Telesimulation studies have demonstrated efficacy in utilizing webcams, smartphones, tablets, microphones, and headsets to capture audio and visual information.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;An innovative study investigated telesimulation in teaching mass casualty triage utilizing wearable technology to deliver emergency medical services (EMS) courses on mass casualty incident (MCI) training to healthcare providers overseas.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;In this feasibility study, the authors demonstrated the successful implementation of an intercontinental MCI triage course using telesimulation and wearable or mobile technology.</p>
        <p>Telesimulation allows learners to benefit from the simulation in large part by overcoming time, distance, and limited human resource barriers. Teledebriefing is one process in telesimulation that allows learners to benefit and gain knowledge and skills from subject matter experts/educators who are not on-site. Teledebriefing also allows subject matter experts the ability to share their expertise and provide value to the community without having to travel extended distances or take the additional time to be physically present at the site of instruction; this can be particularly beneficial for those educators who travel nationally and internationally to provide educational content to learners.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Debriefing Techniques</bold>
</p>
        <p>Teledebriefing is a process in which learners participating in a simulation scenario undergo debriefing with a facilitator at an off-site location. There is a myriad of specific debriefing techniques that are utilizable with telebriefing. For example, the Plus/Delta debriefing technique focuses on learner self-assessment. The debriefer asks open-ended questions such as "What went well?" (plus) and "What could be changed?" (delta) to identify issues that may have occurred during the case to improve future performance. This technique may also be useful in debriefing systems-focused simulations (eg, in-situ code blue team simulation).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r10">[10]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Rapid Cycle Deliberate Practice (RCDP) is a technique of debriefing that has demonstrated effectiveness in simulation scenarios and is designed to teach procedures such as airway management, technical skills, and adherence to resuscitation guidelines. It differs from traditional postscenario debriefing in that it moves the debriefing to occur within the scenario. In RCDP, the scenario gets paused if participants act incorrectly, and they receive immediate feedback and correction from a facilitator. The case then "rewinds," the participants can practice the action again, this time doing it the "right way." The scenarios progress in difficulty upon mastering a skill, built on previously mastered skills.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r12">[12]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r13">[13]</xref></p>
        <p>Advocacy inquiry is a technique where the facilitator first advocates&#x000a0;their observation of an action or behavior and then inquires about the participant's frame of mind relative to the action.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;An example of an advocacy-inquiry exchange could be an instructor saying, "I noticed you had two unsuccessful intubation attempts while the patient was actively seizing (the facilitator advocates&#x000a0;their observation). I was worried about the potential of you getting bitten by the patient during your attempt to open the mouth (shares&#x000a0;their point of view). I was curious about your thought process as you worked to increase the patient's oxygen saturation during the seizure (facilitator inquires about the underlying mental frames that lead to the action)?"</p>
        <p>The GAS (Gather, Analyze, Summarize) conversation structure is another common debriefing method in medical simulation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;In this 3-phase debriefing method, the facilitator encourages the participants to provide a recapitulation of the simulation events (gather), stimulates learner-centered reflection and analysis to evaluate mental models (analyze), and ensures that the learning objectives have received adequate coverage and reviews lessons learned (summarize). Regardless of the specific type of debriefing method, teledebriefing expands learning opportunities for participants who would otherwise not have the educational experience owing to time, distance, and subject matter expert resource challenges.</p>

        <title>Clinical Significance</title>
        <p>Debriefing is arguably the most critical part of the simulation session that pertains explicitly to knowledge consolidation. There is now a small but growing body of evidence addressing this aspect of telesimulation. A study examining the efficacy and feasibility of telebriefing as an alternative to in-person debriefing found that telebriefing was rated slightly lower than in-person debriefing but was still consistently effective. The authors of this study came to the conclusion that since the overall rating of teledebriefing was very high (receiving a score of "consistently effective/very good" on the Debriefing Assessment for Simulation in Healthcare Student Version [DASH-SV]), it may be a practical alternative to debriefing if faculty or staff is unavailable to provide traditional in-person debriefing for simulation-based medical training.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The authors also report the possible reasons teledebriefing was rated lower than traditional debriefing. These included the loss of non-verbal cues (in part due to the debriefer only being viewable from the shoulders up on the video screen), the inability to demonstrate maneuvers or procedures physically, and the inability of teledebriefing faculty to visualize or hear subtle forms of communication between participants during their observation of the simulation session.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;In addition to the limitations mentioned above, technological and time-zone discrepancies can also provide challenges to implementation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;However, despite these limitations, teledebriefing offers a practical and viable option to educate learners who otherwise would not have access to on-site subject matter experts with experience in debriefing.</p>

        <p>Simulation encompasses any processes or technology that recreate a contextual background that allows learners to make decisions, experience success and mistakes, receive feedback, and gain confidence in an environment void of patient risk.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-63890.r14">[14]</xref>&#x000a0;This approach may be particularly useful for low-frequency but high-acuity scenarios. The Institute of Medicine, the Educational Technology Section of an Academic Emergency Medicine Consensus Conference, and the public have advocated for increased simulation-based training to reduce error.&#x000a0; The Association of American Medical Colleges believes simulation is arguably the most prominent innovation in medical education over the past 15 years.&#x000a0; Simulation in medical education and training can revolutionize healthcare education, healthcare delivery, and quality improvement initiatives and address patient safety issues if appropriately utilized and integrated into the educational and organizational improvement process.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p>
