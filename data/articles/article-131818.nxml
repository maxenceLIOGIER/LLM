<bold>Setting Reaction and Interaction with Dentin</bold>
</p>
        <p>Biodentine is a 2-part dental material with specific compositions for its powder and liquid components. The powder's primary component&#x000a0;is tricalcium silicate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Calcium carbonate and oxide act as fillers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Zirconium oxide is added to the powder for X-ray visibility, and iron oxide is used for shade.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;The liquid contains calcium chloride, acting as a setting accelerator and a water-reducing agent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Calcium chloride accelerates the setting time of the material and prevents crack formation, a common issue in cement with high water content. The initial setting time for Biodentine is 9-12 minutes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Saliva and blood contamination can delay setting.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>The setting reaction of Biodentine involves a hydration process, during which the powder and liquid components are mixed using an amalgamator. This trituration process results in a creamy paste. The reaction of the powder with the liquid forms a silicate hydrate gel and calcium hydroxide (CH).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Calcium hydroxide dissociates into hydroxyl (OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) and calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), increasing the pH and Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;This release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> contributes to the material's bioactivity and apatite-forming properties and stimulates dental pulp cell differentiation, ultimately promoting dentin bridge formation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>Biodentine stands out for its high levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release compared to other materials, such as calcium hydroxide (CH) cement, mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), and resin-modified calcium silicate (TheraCal LC).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The material's solubility plays a significant role in this substantial Ca<sup>2+</sup> release.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Additionally, the release of OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> leads to an alkaline environment, supporting tissue repair and forming a protective necrotic zone between the pulp tissue and the capping material.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;This necrotic zone safeguards the pulp cells from the alkaline pH of the material, fostering reparative dentin bridge development.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>Moreover, Biodentine releases silicon ions (Si<sup>4+</sup>) into adjacent dentin, which can stimulate osteoblast proliferation and play a role in mineralization, collagen synthesis, and tissue cross-linking. The ability of Biodentine to form hydroxyapatite crystals after contact with phosphate-containing body fluids further contributes to sealing the tooth/material interface, minimizing microleakage, and creating an environment conducive to reparative dentin formation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>Biodentine interacts with dentin without prior etching or bonding, primarily relying on crystal growth within dentinal tubules.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;While various studies report the presence of an "interfacial layer" or "mineral interfacial zone" at the Biodentine/dentine interface, some studies&#x000a0;report no chemical changes or tag-like structures at this site.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Despite the differences in interpretation, it is evident that Biodentine has the potential to interact with and enhance the adjacent tooth structure, promoting remineralization and contributing to dentin bridge formation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The interaction mechanisms may vary between different studies, and further research is necessary to clarify these processes fully.</p>

        <p>
<bold>Bond Strength</bold>
</p>
        <p>Studies investigating Biodentine's bond strength with various adhesives did not reveal significant differences between adhesive groups at the same time intervals. Aggarwal et al reported that Biodentine exhibited superior push-out bond strength compared to ProRoot MTA and MTA Plus in furcal perforation repairs, with the added advantage that blood contamination did not affect its bond strength.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Porosity and Material-Dentine Interface</bold>
</p>
        <p>Biodentine demonstrated lower porosity when used in a continuously moist environment, although it might present challenges in dry conditions. Research indicated that Biodentine adapts well to dentine due to micromechanical adhesion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Radiopacity</bold>
</p>
        <p>Biodentine's radiopacity is lower than other materials, which could affect its practical use. It uses zirconium oxide as a radiopacifier, known for its biocompatibility. However, this choice may not meet the radiopacity standards set by ISO, and the decision to enhance radiopacity should consider potential effects on biocompatibility.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Biocompatibility</bold>
</p>
        <p>Ensuring the biocompatibility of Biodentine is crucial, especially when it comes into direct contact with periradicular and pulpal cells. Overall, research supports Biodentine's biocompatibility, with favorable results regarding cell adhesion and growth compared to glass ionomer cement. Studies utilizing three-dimensional multicellular spheroid cultures and human dental pulp stem cells confirmed the biocompatible and bioactive characteristics of Biodentine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r2">[2]</xref></p>

        <title>Clinical Significance</title>
        <p>
<bold>Clinical Applications of Biodentine</bold>
</p>
        <p>The manufacturer indicates Biodentine for both crown and root restoration.&#x000a0;Biodentine is recommended as a temporary enamel and permanent dentin substitute in deep carious lesions, deep cervical or radicular lesions, and vital pulp therapy, including pulp capping and pulpotomy. In the root, it can be used for repairing root and furcation perforations and internal and external resorptions. It is also recommended for apexification and retrograde surgical filling.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Clinical Applications of Biodentine: Direct Pulp Capping</bold>
</p>
        <p>Direct pulp capping with Biodentine has been explored in various clinical scenarios. Direct pulp capping protects exposed pulp and promotes pulp vitality by forming tertiary dentin.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The prognosis of direct pulp capping depends on the type of pulp exposure, with traumatic or iatrogenic exposures having better outcomes than carious exposures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Recent bioactive materials, such as Biodentine, have improved the predictability of the procedure following carious exposures.</p>
        <p>Studies in animal models have shown favorable results for Biodentine in direct pulp capping, although variations between animal and human responses need further investigation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The variations may result from different metabolic and immunologic reactions in human tissues.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>For pulp exposures in carie-free permanent teeth, Biodentine and MTA have shown similar clinical results, with both materials promoting the formation of dentinal bridges and minimal inflammatory pulp responses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>In young permanent teeth with immature roots and carious exposures, Biodentine has demonstrated potential as a suitable capping material, showing high success rates in maintaining pulp vitality.</p>
        <p>Even in mature permanent teeth with carious exposures, Biodentine has proven effective in preserving asymptomatic teeth, with dentinal bridge formation and positive outcomes reported in clinical studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>It's important to note that the choice of direct pulp capping material should consider various factors, including the type, size, and site of the pulp exposure and patient age. Although Biodentine appears promising, more research, especially with larger sample sizes, is needed to establish its clinical relevance and success rates compared to other materials like MTA and CH.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Clinical Applications of Biodentine: Primary Teeth Pulpotomy</bold>
</p>
        <p>Pulpotomy is a procedure to preserve the function and vitality of the radicular pulp by surgically removing the coronal part of an exposed vital pulp. Formocresol has traditionally been used&#x000a0;because of its clinical success and ease of use, but concern has been raised regarding mutagenic, toxic, and carcinogenic risks. Biodentine has been suggested as an alternative material to formocresol for pulpotomy procedures. A 2019 randomized clinical trial evaluated the use of Biodentine for pulpotomy in primary molars in children, comparing its clinical and radiographic success rates with formocresol.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Formocresol was chosen due to its long-term clinical success despite concerns over adverse reactions. MTA, another alternative, presented challenges in handling and setting time.</p>
        <p>The study results show high success rates for Biodentine and formocresol pulpotomy techniques over 12 months, which can be attributed to proper protocol, isolation, aseptic conditions, and material handling.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;The success rates were consistent with earlier research, emphasizing that Biodentine can be a suitable alternative for formocresol in primary teeth pulpotomy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Furthermore, the simultaneous use of Biodentine as a dressing and restorative material offers a clinical advantage over formocresol, which requires additional restorative material in the pulp chamber.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Clinical Applications of Biodentine: Pulpotomy in Permanent Teeth with Symptoms of Irreversible Pulpitis</bold>
</p>
        <p>Vital pulp therapy (VPT) is a minimally invasive approach for managing teeth with inflamed pulps compared to conventional root canal treatment (RCT). Several factors have contributed to the growing popularity of VPT, including the limitations of root canal treatments despite advancements in technology, the advantages of preserving tooth structure, maintaining possible defensive mechanisms of the remaining pulp, and reducing the risk of tooth fracture.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;Additionally, VPT has shown comparable success rates to RCT over a 5-year follow-up.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r6">[6]</xref></p>
        <p>Research into pulp biology and the regenerative potential of inflamed pulp has supported the adoption of VPT in select cases. Histological studies indicate that inflammation is often confined to specific pulp areas near the exposure site, with normal histological architecture found in other pulp parts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r6">[6]</xref><bold>&#x000a0;</bold>Clinical symptoms of irreversible pulpitis do not always align with histological findings, emphasizing the need to revise diagnostic terminology and implement minimally invasive treatments.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r6">[6]</xref></p>
        <p>VPT can yield a high success rate, particularly when the irritant is removed, and is considered successful in many cases. Removing the&#x000a0;unsalvageable inflamed part of the dental pulp through partial or complete pulpotomy rather than simply capping the exposure is essential in patients with clinical signs and symptoms of irreversible pulpitis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;This approach has been effective&#x000a0;when mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and calcium-enriched mixture (CEM) are employed.</p>
        <p>A study on the outcomes of Biodentine full pulpotomy in adult permanent teeth with carious exposure and clinical signs of irreversible pulpitis has been conducted. The study's results highlight this pulpotomy approach's success, especially when patients were selected based on the time needed to achieve hemostasis rather than solely relying on clinical symptoms. A full pulpotomy removes the entire coronal pulp while maintaining the health of the remaining radicular portion, increasing the chances of eliminating infected or irreversibly inflamed tissue. The ability to control bleeding after the amputation of the infected pulp tissue is a marker for the degree of inflammation and the potential for healing the remaining pulp tissue, influencing the choice between partial and complete pulpotomy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r6">[6]</xref></p>
        <p>While Biodentine has shown promise in previous clinical trials for pulpotomy, this study explicitly assesses its use in adult patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis.</p>
        <p>The research suggests that full pulpotomy with Biodentine can successfully treat mature permanent teeth with clinical signs and symptoms of irreversible pulpitis. On the 6-month follow-up, 98.4% of cases showed clinical and radiographic success.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;Clinical treatment success increased to 100% on the 12-month follow-up.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;These findings suggest that this minimally invasive approach can be a suitable alternative to conventional root canal treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r6">[6]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Clinical Applications of Biodentine: Furcation Perforation Repair</bold>
</p>
        <p>Biodentine is indicated as a material for furcation perforation repair. Furcation perforations are communications between the root canal system and the external dental surface in multirooted teeth. Repairing these perforations is a challenging aspect of dentistry. A study comparing two different dental repair materials, Biodentine and ProRoot MTA (Mineral Trioxide Aggregate), was conducted in dogs' teeth to treat furcation perforations.</p>
        <p>The key findings and conclusions from the study are as follows:<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <list list-type="order">
          <list-item>
            <p>Radiographic Assessment: Biodentine and MTA showed similar radiographic responses after&#x000a0;4 months. This means that the repair materials used have a similar appearance on radiographs of the treated teeth.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Micro-CT Assessment: Biodentine had significantly less extruded material into the periodontal tissues than MTA. This is important because extruded material can hinder periodontal reattachment and tissue repair. The ability of Biodentine to minimize extrusion is seen as an advantage.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Histological Assessment: Biodentine and MTA demonstrated good biocompatibility, as there was&#x000a0;reduced&#x000a0;inflammation in the treated teeth, with only a few scattered inflammatory cells. Inflammation was significantly lower in the Biodentine group compared to the MTA group.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Hard Tissue Resorption and Repair: Both materials showed similar hard tissue resorption and repair. Both materials allowed for the formation of new mineralized tissue bridges over the remaining radicular pulp tissue.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Cementum Repair: Biodentine showed significantly better cementum repair scores compared to MTA. This suggests that Biodentine may be more effective in promoting cementum formation in the furcation area.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>The study suggests that Biodentine is a promising biomaterial for repairing furcation perforations, as it demonstrated good biocompatibility, reduced inflammation, and effective repair outcomes. It also had the advantage of extruding less material into the periodontal tissues, which is considered favorable.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-131818.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;However, it's important to note that this study was conducted on dogs, and further research may be needed to extrapolate these findings to clinical applications in humans.</p>
