        <p>An airborne disorder is any disease that is caused by a microorganism that is transmitted through the air. There are many airborne diseases that are of clinical importance and include bacteria, viruses, and fungi. These organisms may be spread through sneezing, coughing, spraying of liquids, the spread of dust, or any activity that results in the generation of aerosolized particles. The microorganisms transmitted airborne may be spread via a fine mist, dust, aerosols, or liquids. The aerosolized particles may be generated from a source of infection, such as body secretions of an infected patient or even an animal. In addition, aerosols may be generated from biological waste products that accumulate in garbage, caves, and dry arid containers. During aerosolization, the microorganisms that are less than 100 microns in size float in the air. Sometimes, the microorganisms may be contained in dust particles that are present in the air. Once the droplets that contain microorganisms have been formed, they are then dispersed via air currents to varying distances and can be inhaled by susceptible hosts. The infected aerosolized particles often remain suspended in the air currents and may travel considerable distances, although many particles will drop off within the vicinity. As the distance traveled of the aerosol particle increases, the risk of infection starts to drop. Airborne precautions necessitate the prevention of infections and the use of available interventions in healthcare facilities to prevent the transmission of airborne particles. The airborne particles may remain localized to the room or move depending on the airflow. In some cases where there is inadequate ventilation, the airborne particle may remain in the hospital room and be inhaled by a newly admitted patient. The control and prevention of airborne transmission of infections are not simple. It requires the control of airflow with the use of specially designed ventilator systems, the practice of antiseptic techniques, wearing personalized protection equipment (PPE), and performing basic infection prevention measures like hand washing. This activity reviews the techniques for minimizing the spread of airborne diseases and the role of the interprofessional team in maximizing airborne precautions to minimize the spread of disease.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>An airborne disorder is any disease that is caused by a microorganism that is transmitted through the air. Many clinically important airborne diseases are caused by a variety of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;These organisms may be transmitted through sneezing, coughing, spraying of liquids, the spread of dust, talking, or any activity that results in the generation of aerosolized particles. It is important to be aware that airborne diseases, in general, do not include disorders caused by air pollution, poisons, smog, and dust.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>According to the World Health Organization, &#x0201c;Airborne transmission of infectious agents refers to the transmission of disease caused by the dissemination of droplet nuclei that remain infectious when suspended in air over long distance and time.&#x0201d; Airborne transmission can be characterized as <italic toggle="yes">obligate</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">preferential</italic> depending on whether it is only transmitted via droplet nuclei or if it has multiple other routes of transmission.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>The microorganisms transmitted by an airborne route may be spread via fine mist, dust, aerosols, or liquids. The aerosolized particles are generated from a source of infection, such as an infected patient or animal. In addition, aerosols may be generated from biological waste products that accumulate in garbage cans, caves, and dry arid containers.&#x000a0;In aerosolization, the microorganisms that are less than 100 micrometers in size float in the air. These microorganisms, contained in droplets, are then dispersed via air currents to varying distances and can be inhaled by susceptible hosts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;Although a majority of the particles will drop off within the vicinity, the infected aerosolized particles often remain suspended in the air and may even travel considerable distances. As the distance between the source and susceptible individuals increases, the rate of transmission decreases. Airborne transmission necessitates the use of available&#x000a0;interventions in healthcare facilities to&#x000a0;break the transmission of airborne particles from patient to patient and patient to healthcare workers. Airborne particles are considered highly infectious as they often remain suspended in the air and travel&#x000a0;by air currents to different parts of the hospital, where there is a potential of them being inhaled by others. In some cases where there is inadequate ventilation, the airborne particle may remain in the hospital room for extended periods and may even be inhaled by a newly admitted patient.</p>
        <p>The control and prevention of airborne transmission of infections are not simple; it requires the control of airflow with the use of specially designed ventilation systems, the practice of antiseptic techniques, wearing personalized&#x000a0;protective equipment (PPE), and performing basic infection prevention measures like hand washing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r10">[10]</xref></p>

<bold>Airborne Organisms</bold>
</p>
        <p>In almost all cases, airborne pathogens cause an inflammatory reaction of the upper airways affecting the nose, sinuses, throat, and lungs. The involvement of these structures may result in sinus congestion, sore throat, and lower respiratory tract symptoms. Any coughing or sneezing activity may then generate aerosolized particles leading to airborne transmission. Some of the common pathogens that may spread via airborne transmission are:</p>

        <p>Airborne diseases are not exclusive to humans and can also infect animals. A notable example is poultry that is often affected by an avian disorder (Newcastle disease), which is also transmitted via an airborne route. However, it is important to understand that exposure to an animal or a patient with an airborne disease does not automatically ensure disease transmission. The infection also depends on the host's immunity, the amount of exposure, and the duration of exposure to the infected patient.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r13">[13]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r14">[14]</xref></p>

<bold>Factors that influence airborne transmission</bold>
</p>
        <p>Airborne transmission depends on several physical variables characteristic of the infectious particle and the environment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r10">[10]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r14">[14]</xref> Factors that influence the spread of airborne infections to include the following:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">Temperature</italic>: Certain viruses are more active at lower temperatures. For example, influenza tends to spread more easily in cold climate conditions. In contrast, the infectivity of bacterial pathogens decreases in cold temperatures as they are less resistant and thus remain in a state of dormancy.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">Amount of sunshine</italic>: Ultraviolet (UV) rays of the sun are harmful to bacteria and viruses. The strength and duration of UV light exposure can determine the survival of infectious pathogens in the air. Countries that have a higher average daily sunshine are thus less prone to airborne transmission.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">Humidity</italic>: The percentage of water vapor in the air also determines the effectiveness of airborne droplet nuclei to spread from person to person. It has been studied that high humidity levels are protective against UV light destruction as water vapor forms a protective barrier around the droplet nuclei.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">Wind</italic>: Air currents are known to increase the distance traveled by infectious airborne particles. Wind also, however, decreases the concentration of droplet nuclei, thus decreasing the airborne infectivity.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>
<bold>Other Factors</bold>
</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">Tropical Storms</italic>: Several studies have shown that tropical storms decrease the quantity of fungal spores in the air. The&#x000a0;number of fungal spores does, however, increase after a few days.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">Socioeconomic and living conditions</italic>: Like infectious diseases that are spread via contact, the role of living conditions and socioeconomic factors also plays a key role in airborne transmission. Housing and the number of people residing in one room/area is an important determinant of airborne transmission. Room ventilation and aeration are also key factors. Airconditioning is also considered a culprit for the increased airborne spread in closed environments.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">Rural vs. Urban</italic>: In urban areas, close living conditions result in increased transmission of bacterial and viral pathogens. In contrast, rural areas are more prone to airborne transmission of fungal spores.</p>

          <list-item>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">I</italic><italic toggle="yes">nadequate sewage and drainage systems</italic>: Biowaste accumulation also increases the risk of the formation of airborne particles and thus their spread.</p>

        <p>An article published in 2009 highlights how every pathogen has its own set of ideal environmental conditions for airborne transmission. Generalization of the unfavorable conditions for aerosol transmission may be misleading. Each pathogen should be separately studied in this regard.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r16">[16]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Management Principles</bold>
</p>
        <p>When patients are seen in the emergency room or admitted to the hospital, it is impossible to know immediately if they have an infection that is transmissible via the airborne route.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r17">[17]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r18">[18]</xref> Thus, healthcare workers need to maintain a high degree of suspicion in patients who present with signs and symptoms compatible with such an infection. The earlier the airborne prevention methods are adopted, the lower the risk of transmission to other patients and healthcare staff.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r14">[14]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r19">[19]</xref></p>

<bold>Patient Movements</bold>
</p>
        <p>In hospitals, patients admitted to the negative room often have to be transported to other departments like radiology, physical therapy, the pulmonary laboratory, or even another hospital. Before transferring a patient with an airborne infection, one must always communicate with the relevant department first. The guidelines for transportation are as follows:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>During transport, the patient should wear a surgical mask.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>There may be situations when during the transport, the patient may not wear a mask. In such scenarios, the transport should be performed in a way to limit the exposure to other patients or staff. This means the transport staff should not wait in the reception area or leave the patient in a holding area.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>The patient should preferably be transported in an empty elevator, and the personnel that is transporting the patient should be told to maintain infectious disease precautions throughout the transportation. These include appropriate N95 respirators and personal protective equipment.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>If the patient is intubated, call the respiratory therapist ahead of time to ensure that the transport is done according to respiratory guidelines.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>
<bold>Patient and Family Education</bold>
</p>
        <p>Patients who require isolation due to the risk of airborne transmission need to be counseled regarding their condition and infectivity. Their family members, caretakers, and visitors must also be educated so that they may abide by preventive guidelines to ensure that the disease is not transmitted. The patient should be educated on coughing etiquettes to ensure the minimum spread of aerosolized particles in the isolation room. Face tissues and handkerchiefs must be properly and appropriately disposed of to further decrease the chances of transmission. Furthermore, a sign recommending infectious precautions should be placed outside the isolation room so that all visitors may be apprised by the guidelines. Unnecessary visits should be avoided, and all immunocompromised individuals must refrain from entering the isolation room. All visitors must follow the use of N95 respirators and hand hygiene without lapses.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Duration of Precautions</bold>
</p>
        <p>In general, airborne precautions can be discontinued once the patient shows no signs or symptoms of an infection.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r10">[10]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r21">[21]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r23">[23]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r24">[24]</xref></p>

<bold>Managing Deceased Patients</bold>
</p>
        <p>When a patient is deceased, airborne precautions remain necessary when handling and preparing the body during transfer to the morgue. Similarly, performing an autopsy also warrants proper personal protective equipment and the use of N95 respirators.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Managing specimens and rooms of patients and with airborne infections</bold>
</p>
        <p>When a patient with an airborne transmissible disease has been discharged, it is important to continue airborne precautions while decontaminating the room. The door must remain closed, and negative air flow must be maintained until all air in the room has been recirculated and replaced. This process usually requires 45 to 60 minutes, depending on the size of the room. Soiled linen should be handled with gloves with minimal agitation to prevent the dispersion of microorganisms into the air. The laundry hamper should be close to the location so that the linen can be placed inside rather than carried a long distance. If there is obvious contamination with body fluids, the linen should be placed in a plastic bag. Proper handling and transport of specimens: All body specimens should be considered infectious and handled safely.</p>

        <title>Other Issues</title>
        <p>Due to the pandemic caused by COVID-19, there has been an acute shortage of personal protective equipment and N95 respirators. This has made hospitals, doctors, and the public resort to alternate precautions for airborne transmission. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), N95 respirators are not recommended for daily wear by the public. Instead, the CDC recommends that the public use a simple face cloth covering to protect themselves and others from COVID-19. Alternatively, simple surgical masks are also considered effective at blocking large-particle droplets, splashes, and splatters that may contain viruses and bacteria. Surgical masks can also help reduce&#x000a0;the dispersion of&#x000a0;one's own saliva and respiratory secretions to others, thus proving important to contain the spread of pathogens. While considered important, surgical masks do not filter or block small particles in the air that may be transmitted by coughs, sneezes, and other medical procedures (intubation). Thus, N95 respirators are considered the protection of choice for healthcare workers when dealing with patients diagnosed with diseases that may be airborne. N95s are designed to ensure a tight fit around the nose and mouth so that they can efficiently filter out 95% of the particles sized 0.3 micrometers or more without leakage of air. Due to their tight fit and filtering capabilities, breathing in an N95 respirator is associated with heat build-up and distress. To make breathing easier, some models of N95 respirators come with exhalation valves that make breathing out easier. Care must be taken not to use those valves when sterility is required. Due to the immense shortage of N95 masks during the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued the emergency use authorizations of decontaminating procedures for some respirators, provided there are insufficient supplies of new ones. Multiple methods for decontamination have been described by the CDC, including the use of ultraviolet radiation, vaporous hydrogen peroxide, moist heat, microwave-generated steam, and ethylene oxide. Alternatively, CDC also recommends that 5 N95 respirators may be issued to each healthcare professional so that they may wear one respirator each day and store it in a breathable paper bag at the end of each shift to decontaminate it&#x000a0;using time. This guideline is based on the study that outlines that SARS-CoV-2 is able to survive for up to 72 hours on various surfaces.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r25">[25]</xref><bold><italic toggle="yes">&#x000a0;</italic></bold>&#x000a0;Other studies are also determining whether using a surgical mask on top of an N95 respirator extends the life of the respirator. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41609.r26">[26]</xref><bold>&#x000a0;</bold>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, another respirator gaining popularity is the KN95 mask. This is manufactured in accordance with the standards of China. It is claimed that the KN95 masks are similar to the N95 respirators for filtering non-oil-based particles. Despite these claims, the FDA has not yet authorized the use of KN95 respirators.</p>
