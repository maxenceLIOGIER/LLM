        <p content-type="pubmed-excerpt">The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has as its primary goal the creation of value for the patients of our&#x000a0;healthcare&#x000a0;system. One of the main ways it&#x000a0;accomplishes&#x000a0;value-based outcomes is driven by incentivizing doctors, hospitals, and healthcare providers to coordinate clinically efficient patient care. The healthcare providers become eligible for various (financial and/or other occupationally-based) bonuses when clinical care is delivered&#x000a0;effectively with quality outcomes.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34821.r1">[1]</xref> &#x000a0; &#x000a0;Strategies such as the Bundled Payment Care Initiative (BPCI) and Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) will emphasize reducing expensive and unnecessary services and becoming more cost-effective for patients.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34821.r2">[2]</xref> &#x000a0;Hospitals and physicians must&#x000a0;meet specific quality benchmarks, which focus on disease prevention, carefully managing patients with chronic diseases, and keeping patients healthy.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The term ACO&#x000a0;was originally coined&#x000a0;by researchers and policy experts&#x000a0;to describe entities that consist of&#x000a0;responsibly integrated healthcare providers who all are working toward achieving a common clinical goal and outcome: efficient, high-quality patient care while utilizing&#x000a0;a common clinical pathway that incorporates&#x000a0;principles of treatment and therapeutic modalities in a multifaceted provider setting.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34821.r3">[3]</xref></p>

        <title>Issues of Concern</title>
        <p>To achieve these goals, the&#x000a0;Affordable Care Act&#x000a0;significantly changed the way healthcare is offered and how healthcare providers are reimbursed. While the primary purpose of the&#x000a0;Affordable Care Act&#x000a0;is to provide all Americans with access to affordable health insurance, various components will potentially have a significant impact on how physicians are compensated for providing care. The traditional fee-for-service system is slowly being replaced by a variety of managed care initiatives. The&#x000a0;Affordable Care Act&#x000a0;proposes further reform of the&#x000a0;health care service-delivery system through the establishment of Accountable Care Organization and the Bundled Care Payment Initiative through the Medicare program. The implementation of both the Accountable&#x000a0;Care Organization&#x000a0;and&#x000a0;Bundled Care Payment Initiative seeks to incentivize and facilitate&#x000a0;integrated, coordinated medical care. Accountable Care Organization&#x000a0;initiatives try to achieve this through organizational structure reforms, while the bundled payment initiative looks to do so with payment reforms.</p>
        <p>Accountable Care Organizations&#x000a0;place financial responsibility on providers in hopes of improving patient management and decreasing&#x000a0;unnecessary expenditures while providing patients with the&#x000a0;freedom to select medical service providers. The Accountable&#x000a0;Care Organizations&#x000a0;model promotes clinical excellence while simultaneously controlling costs. This&#x000a0;cost-control depends on the Accountable&#x000a0;Care Organization's&#x000a0;ability to incentivize hospitals, physicians, post-acute care facilities, and other providers to form partnerships and promote better coordination of care delivery. By increasing care coordination, Accountable Care Organizations&#x000a0;hope to reduce unnecessary medical care and improve health outcomes. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimates, the Accountable&#x000a0;Care Organization's&#x000a0;implementation is&#x000a0;estimated to result in a median savings of $470 million from 2012 through 2015.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Accountable&#x000a0;Care Organizations (ACOs) were a significant component of the Affordable Care Act as&#x000a0;they proposed a method for cost containment within the healthcare system.&#x000a0; As the healthcare field shifts from the traditional fee-for-service (FFS) model, alternative payment schemes have focused on ACOS and BPCIs.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Bundled Payment Care Initiatives (BPCIs)</bold>
</p>
        <p>BPCIs have become increasingly popular in various selective fields of predictable surgeries (i.e., elective procedures) such as total joint replacements.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34821.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34821.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;Furthermore, in&#x000a0;future fields and evolving areas across subspecialties like orthopedic surgery, BPCI models are potentially being implemented and/or becoming experimental in diagnostic related groups such as hip fracture patients, elective cervical spine procedures (ACDFs), and isolated surgical extremity trauma.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34821.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs)</bold>
</p>
        <p>Instead of bundling all the cost for a single episode of care as in the Bundled Payment Care Initiative, ACOs&#x000a0;measure the&#x000a0;specific quality outcomes over a 3-year period and requires&#x000a0;demonstrated&#x000a0;improved outcomes.</p>
        <p>For the Accountable&#x000a0;Care Organization,&#x000a0;&#x0201c;this emphasizes that these cost and quality improvements must achieve&#x000a0;overall, per capita improvements in quality and cost, and that [Accountable Care Organizations]&#x000a0;should have at least limited accountability for achieving these improvements while caring for a defined population of patients".&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-34821.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <p>Stakeholders in Accountable&#x000a0;Care Organizations include:</p>
        <p>
<italic toggle="yes">Healthcare providers</italic>
</p>
        <p>Accountable&#x000a0;Care Organizations&#x000a0;are composed mostly of hospitals and&#x000a0;healthcare professionals. Depending on the Accountable&#x000a0;Care Organization&#x000a0;level of integration, providers may include health departments, social security departments, safety net clinics, and home care services. The providers within an Accountable&#x000a0;Care Organization&#x000a0;work to coordinate care, align incentives, and lower costs. Accountable&#x000a0; Care Organizations&#x000a0;are different from Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) in that providers&#x000a0;have more freedom in developing the infrastructure. Any provider or provider organization may assume the leadership role.</p>
        <p>
<italic toggle="yes">Payors (insurance companies, third-party organizations)</italic>
</p>
        <p>Medicare is the Accountable&#x000a0;Care Organization's&#x000a0;principal payer. Other payers include private insurance and employer-purchased insurance. Payers play several roles in the Accountable&#x000a0;Care Organization&#x000a0;to help achieve higher quality care and lower expenditures. Payers may collaborate to align incentives for Accountable&#x000a0;Care organizations&#x000a0;and create financial incentives for providers to improve healthcare quality.</p>
        <p>
<italic toggle="yes">Patients</italic>
</p>
        <p>Accountable&#x000a0;Care Organization&#x000a0;patient populations consist of primarily Medicare beneficiaries. In larger and more integrated Accountable&#x000a0;Care Organizations, the patient population includes uninsured patients. Patients may play a role in the healthcare they receive by participating in the decision-making processes.</p>
        <p>The Medicare Shared Savings Program allows&#x000a0;a variety of providers, including post-acute care provider, who voluntarily agrees to coordinate care for patients. They must, however, meet certain quality metrics&#x000a0;to share in any savings they achieve. Those Accountable&#x000a0;Care Organizations&#x000a0;that&#x000a0;elect to&#x000a0;share&#x000a0;losses have the opportunity to also share in greater savings. The success of each Accountable&#x000a0;Care Organization&#x000a0;is&#x000a0;determined by approximately 30 quality measures organized into four domains. These domains include patient experience, care coordination, safety, and preventive health in&#x000a0;at-risk populations. The higher the quality of care providers deliver, the more shared savings their Accountable&#x000a0; Care Organization&#x000a0;can earn, as long as they also lower growth in health care expenditures.</p>

        <title>Clinical Significance</title>
        <p>Although the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid&#x000a0;Services (CMS) proposed the Accountable&#x000a0;Care Organization&#x000a0;model, currently, there are several&#x000a0;different varieties of an Accountable&#x000a0; Care Organization&#x000a0;available for patients. Typically, Accountable&#x000a0;Care Organizations&#x000a0;consist&#x000a0;of a large payer, like an insurance company, coupled with a large group of healthcare providers. In addition, there are large employers that are taking advantage of the shared savings, partnering with healthcare systems, and removing the insurers altogether. The design&#x000a0;of an Accountable&#x000a0;Care Organization&#x000a0;is based on the principle that each provider will be held accountable for the cost and quality of the care provided, prevention of disease, and avoidance&#x000a0;of waste.</p>
        <p>There are challenges with Accountable Care Organizations, which include the lack of how Accountable&#x000a0; Care organizations&#x000a0;should be implemented. The American Hospital Association estimated that Accountable&#x000a0;Care Organization&#x000a0;formation&#x000a0;incurs high startup costs and enormous&#x000a0;annual expenses. Accountable&#x000a0;Care Organizations&#x000a0;risk violating antitrust laws if they drive up costs by reducing competition. To address the antitrust violation concern, the US Department of Justice offered a voluntary antitrust review process for Accountable&#x000a0;Care Organization.</p>
        <p>Significant challenges face primary-care physicians who join an Accountable Care Organization&#x000a0;via a group practice, hospital-medical practice alignment, or another joint venture such as an independent practice association. Physician groups need a robust Electronic Health Record system with&#x000a0;advanced reporting, disease registries, and patient population care management. Organizations that achieve Patient-Centered Medical Home accreditation have mastered these functions and are further along the road to meeting Accountable&#x000a0;Care Organization&#x000a0;metrics.</p>
