        <p>Death is a part of natural life; however, society is notorious for being uncomfortable with death and dying as a topic on the whole. Many caregivers experience a level of burden from their duties during end-of-life care. This burden is multi-faceted and may include performing medical tasks, communicating with providers, decision-making, and possibly anticipating the grief of impending loss.

        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>The&#x000a0;vast majority of patients who experience a natural death, meaning&#x000a0;no medical, life-saving interventions to counter the process, follow a stereotypical pattern of signs and symptoms in the time leading up to death.&#x000a0;This time&#x000a0;frame is often referred to as "actively dying" or&#x000a0;"imminent death." It is important for&#x000a0;healthcare&#x000a0;providers to be familiar with this process, not only so they&#x000a0;know what to expect when providing direct&#x000a0;care to&#x000a0;patients during this time but also so they can&#x000a0;guide the family in&#x000a0;understanding what to expect and providing support as needed.</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Early stage: Loss of mobility and becoming bed-bound; loss of interest or ability to drink and eat; cognitive changes to include increased time sleeping or experiencing delirium. Delirium can be a hyperactive or agitated state or a hypoactive state. The trademark point of delirium is there is an acute change in the level of arousal.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20274.r2">[2]</xref></p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Middle stage: Further decline in mental status to becoming obtunded or slow arousal with stimulation and only brief periods of wakefulness. Patients often exhibit the "death rattle" which a noisy breathing pattern caused by a pooling of oral secretions due to the loss of the swallowing reflex.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Late stage: Coma; fever, possibly due to aspiration pneumonia; an altered respiratory pattern, which can be periods of apnea alternated with hyperpnea or irregular breathing; and mottled extremities due to the constriction of the peripheral circulation&#x000a0;</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>The timeline for each patient is variable. A patient may experience these signs and symptoms over 24 hours or longer than 14 days.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20274.r3">[3]</xref></p>

        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>Death is the end state of every disease process; however, each disease has a different progression and course. It is important to&#x000a0;assess the patient for findings related to their underlying disease process and their needs related to the death and dying process.</p>
        <p>The self-determination of the patient&#x000a0;with capacity must be respected. When patients can make&#x000a0;their own choices,&#x000a0;their&#x000a0;autonomy&#x000a0;must be upheld. It is not the role of the provider to impart their values and beliefs to patients. Patients' families may experience anticipatory grief&#x000a0;and have a hard time&#x000a0;fully handling the current situation. They may want to push their personal choices for the situation instead of respecting their loved one's wishes and choices. As healthcare providers leading family discussions related to these difficult topics, remember always to keep the patient's goals at the forefront.</p>
        <p>This type of&#x000a0;discussion may arise because of the following reasons (but is not limited to):</p>

        <p>When gathering information about a patient and a situation, it is important to create a calm environment and allow the patient and their family to feel comfortable. Give them enough time to answer questions. Ensure that each party's goals have been discussed: the patient's, the family's, and the medical team's.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20274.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20274.r5">[5]</xref></p>

        <p>The evaluation necessary depends on the individual patient and where they are in their process.

        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>The primary goal in treatment for patients is alleviating suffering. Hospice care and palliative care are often confused. Hospice care is the term given to the care provided when a patient is given a prognosis of death within&#x000a0;6 months, and they do not pursue curative&#x000a0;treatments. They focus on improving the quality of life, which can mean many things. Palliative care can be incorporated into the plan of care at any time for any patient who is experiencing suffering and wants to ease that suffering without directly treating the cause of that suffering. Someone may use palliative care in addition to curative treatments. Suffering may have many forms, and the care provided should be multi-disciplinary. Some areas that may be addressed are spiritual with chaplain services; caregiver fatigue with community resources or a social worker; physical symptoms such as pain, nausea, and constipation with a multimodal approach; and even a palliative care team leader to coordinate all the moving pieces and keep the family and patient aware of what is happening. It is important to establish a treatment goal with the patient and family and understand that this goal may evolve.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20274.r5">[5]</xref></p>

        <p>A developing topic in palliative and hospice care is that of assisted death. A handful of countries have legalized the practice, which includes the patient filling a prescription from a provider for a lethal dose of medication after the appropriate&#x000a0;screening. In the United States of America, California, Montana, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington have laws that allow terminally ill patients to choose assisted death if appropriately screened.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20274.r8">[8]</xref></p>

        <p>Most people die in the hospital; however, most&#x000a0;Americans report they would not wish to die in the hospital if they could choose. Days spent at home is an important patient-centered outcome. When reviewing data on community-living older people, days spent at home in the last&#x000a0;6 months did not differ by age, sex, or race/ethnicity. Still, they were significantly lower for patients suffering from organ failure and highest for sudden death and cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20274.r9">[9]</xref></p>

        <title>Complications</title>
        <p>Talking about death and dying is an important element in the treatment and care of patients and families. The healthcare provider needs to be comfortable engaging with this type of discussion during the terminal phase and in the early stages of a grave prognosis or when broached by a patient. It is crucial, as a healthcare provider, to self-reflect on one's emotional&#x000a0;thoughts and feelings regarding death and dying,&#x000a0;in general,&#x000a0;and how the topics relate to each patient. It is normal to have strong feelings. Identify those feelings. Talk with a colleague or keep a personal journal. It is helpful to role-play difficult discussions and reflect on the emotions before having them. Addressing those emotions before encountering the patients and their families allows the healthcare provider to be fully present for that patient and their needs.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>As mentioned before, the primary cause of death for ages 1 through 44 years in the United States of America is unintentional injuries. This causes a complicated grief situation for the family due to the swiftness and unexpectedness of the situation. Ensure to provide resources and be prepared to repeat information as the family may experience the first stage of grief and denial and not retain what was discussed in your meeting. If the second stage of grief, anger, is present, practitioners should not take anger directed toward them. The family has&#x000a0;a unique grief experience. Provide support as they need it.</p>
        <p>Conflicts may arise when a patient's wishes do not match a family member's wishes, or a patient wants to continue treatments that the medical team deems futile. In such situations, it is advisable to hold several discussions to ensure that all parties have the same information and understanding. An ethics committee may need to become involved if a resolution cannot be reached.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20274.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20274.r10">[10]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20274.r11">[11]</xref></p>

        <p>Continuity is important. Discussions should take place often and should not contain too much information. It is important to ensure that each party understands the information delivered in each session. A good technique is to <italic toggle="yes">Ask/Tell/Teach/Ask</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">Ask</italic> the patient or family member what they understand about the topic to be discussed&#x000a0;to have a baseline for their knowledge. Then you can <italic toggle="yes">Tell</italic> them the new information or <italic toggle="yes">Teach</italic> them the new skill. Finally, <italic toggle="yes">Ask</italic> them to repeat what you told or taught them in their own words.</p>

            <p>Sedation: In a few cases, complex symptoms may be so severe that they are refractory to all medications, and the undertreatment of those symptoms causes distress. They may perform continuous sedation until death in these types of situations. Discussions should be open and honest and involve all pertinent parties. The depth of sedation should be symptom-guided.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20274.r5">[5]</xref></p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>Standardizing clinical education on how to discuss death and dying among healthcare providers opens the conversation for patients and their families to&#x000a0;palliative care and how to best care for their loved ones. Palliative care is underused, which may be due to the stigma related to giving up fighting one's illness or the stigma related to death in our culture. When healthcare providers are more comfortable with this topic, patients and their families are the beneficiaries. The interprofessional team can provide higher-quality holistic care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20274.r12">[12]</xref></p>
