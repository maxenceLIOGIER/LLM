        <title>Definition/Introduction</title>
        <p content-type="pubmed-excerpt">Parenting varies widely across families, with cultural backgrounds having a significant role in shaping family dynamics and child-rearing practices. Over the past several years, the demographic makeup of the United States has shifted, driven by immigration, socioeconomic changes, and the rise of single-parent households, all of which influence parenting styles. These changes bring diverse cultural, ethnic, and spiritual ideologies into play. According to 2014 US Census Bureau data, 1 quarter of children lived in single-parent households, while 3 quarters resided with 2 married parents, and these patterns varied across different racial and ethnic groups. Although children can thrive in all family structures, data indicate that, on average, children residing in single-parent households face more challenges than those in 2-parent families.</p>
        <p>Culture is defined as a shared pattern of social norms, values, language, and behavior, which significantly influences parenting. As a result, parenting approaches to self-regulation&#x02014;such as promoting attention, compliance, delayed gratification, executive function, and effortful control&#x02014;vary across cultures.</p>
        <p>Each parent has a unique approach to interacting with and guiding their children, thereby shaping&#x000a0;their&#x000a0;morals, principles, and behavior.&#x000a0;Researchers have categorized parenting styles into various groups&#x02014;typically 3, 4, or 5 psychological constructs. However,&#x000a0;this discussion focuses on 4 main categories&#x02014;authoritarian, authoritative, permissive, and uninvolved. Each category represents a distinct approach to raising children, although parents often blend characteristics from multiple categories. Parenting styles can also vary depending on the situation.</p>

        <title>Issues of Concern</title>
        <p>
<bold>Authoritarian Parenting</bold>
</p>
        <p>Authoritarian parents typically engage in a 1-way mode of&#x000a0;communication where they establish strict rules that the child is expected to follow without question or negotiation.&#x000a0;These rules are rarely explained, and children are expected to meet high standards without making mistakes. Errors are often met with punishment. Authoritarian parents tend to be less nurturing, maintaining high expectations with limited flexibility.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Children raised by authoritarian parents often exhibit well-behaved behavior due to the consequences of misbehavior.&#x000a0;Additionally, they tend to follow precise instructions more effectively to achieve their goals. However, this parenting style can also lead to higher levels of aggression, while children may also exhibit shyness, social ineptitude, and difficulty making their own decisions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130840.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;This&#x000a0;uncontrolled aggression may stem from challenges in managing anger, as these children often lack proper guidance. Additionally, they may struggle with low self-esteem, which further hinders their decision-making abilities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130840.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Strict parental rules and punishments can also drive children to rebel against authority figures as they grow older.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Authoritative Parenting</bold>
</p>
        <p>Authoritative parenting is characterized by a close, nurturing relationship between parents and children. Parents set clear expectations and guidelines and explain the reasoning behind their disciplinary actions. They use disciplinary methods as a supportive tool rather than as punishment. Children are encouraged to have input in setting goals and expectations, thereby fostering open, frequent, and appropriate communication between parent and child. This parenting style generally results in the healthiest outcomes for children but requires considerable patience and effort from both parties.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Authoritative parenting fosters confidence, responsibility, and self-regulation in children.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130840.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130840.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;These children manage negative emotions more effectively, leading to improved social outcomes and emotional well-being. By encouraging independence, authoritative parents help their children understand that they can achieve goals on their own, resulting in higher self-esteem. Additionally, these children tend to excel academically and perform well in school.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130840.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Permissive Parenting</bold>
</p>
        <p>Permissive parents are typically warm and nurturing, often holding minimal expectations for their children. They impose few rules and maintain open communication, allowing their children to navigate situations independently. This lack of expectation usually leads to infrequent disciplinary actions, as permissive parents often take on a more friend-like role than that of traditional authority figures.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Limited rules can lead children to develop unhealthy eating habits, particularly regarding snacks,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130840.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;increasing their risk of obesity and other health issues later in life. These children enjoy considerable freedom, making decisions about their bedtime, homework, and screen time on computers and televisions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130840.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;Such extensive freedom can foster negative habits, as parents often provide little guidance on moderation. Overall, while children of permissive parents typically possess good self-esteem and decent social skills, they may also be impulsive, demanding, selfish, and struggle with self-regulation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130840.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130840.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Uninvolved Parenting</bold>
</p>
        <p>Uninvolved parenting grants children a high degree of freedom, as these parents typically take a hands-off approach. While they may fulfill their child's basic needs, they remain emotionally detached and disengaged from their child's life. Uninvolved parents do not adhere to a specific disciplinary style and maintain limited communication with their children, providing minimal nurturing and having few, if any, expectations.</p>
        <p>Children of uninvolved parents often demonstrate resilience and may be more self-sufficient than those raised in other parenting styles. However, these skills are typically developed out of necessity. Additionally, they may struggle with emotional regulation, exhibit less effective coping strategies, face academic challenges, and have difficulty maintaining or nurturing social relationships.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130840.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-130840.r10">[10]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-130840.s3" sec-type="Clinical Significance">
        <title>Clinical Significance</title>
        <p>A parent's upbringing style can significantly influence a child's behaviors and actions as they age. However, as children grow older, other factors&#x02014;such as therapy, culture, employment, and social circles&#x02014;can further shape or alter their conduct. Regarding health outcomes, it is crucial to identify areas of concern linked to a patient's parental upbringing, such as unmonitored snacking habits, and to address these issues accordingly. This approach becomes increasingly important in the context of behavioral and psychological interventions.</p>
        <p>Developing cultural competence is a valuable asset for providers caring for pediatric patients. Understanding the family's background, rule-setting practices, and discipline styles enables clinicians to grasp the dynamics of the family unit. Once providers are familiar with parenting techniques, they can more easily identify, manage, or refer families as needed.</p>

        <title>Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions</title>
        <p>Child interventions may necessitate an understanding of the parent's upbringing style, particularly if there are suspicions of physical or verbal abuse. Gaining insight into the child's home environment can lead to improved patient outcomes by allowing for more personalized approaches to the child's well-being.</p>
