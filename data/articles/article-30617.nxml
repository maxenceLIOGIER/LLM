        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>The triple arthrodesis is a versatile procedure useful in many pedal conditions and gait disturbances. The term "triple" arthrodesis refers to a fusion procedure of three joints of the hindfoot; the subtalar joint (talus and calcaneus), the talonavicular joint, and the calcaneocuboid joint.&#x000a0; Due to the procedure's predictability, it is often used as a definitive treatment for many pedal deformities and offers patients the ability for pain-free, propulsive gait.&#x000a0; In one study following patients who underwent a triple arthrodesis, 95% of patients were satisfied with the outcome after 44 years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30617.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;It is not without its disadvantages; however, the loss of range of motion afterward may make other procedures a more prudent choice.</p>

        <title>Anatomy and Physiology</title>
        <p>The most common approach to a triple arthrodesis is a double incision, one lateral incision, and one medial.&#x000a0;As such, many structures are encountered during dissection and fixation. The most common structures encountered are discussed here.&#x000a0;Laterally, nerves encountered are the sural and intermediate dorsal cutaneous nerve.&#x000a0; Vascular structures encountered on the lateral incision include the artery of the tarsal sinus&#x000a0;and venous connections supplying the extensor digitorum brevis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30617.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Muscle and tendons encountered laterally are the peroneal tendons, extensor digitorum brevis muscle belly, and the peroneus tertius tendon. Medially the posterior tibial tendon is commonly encountered on its distal insertion.&#x000a0; Depending on the technique, the&#x000a0;deltoid artery and the artery of the tarsal canal may be encountered&#x000a0;medially, as well as the great saphenous vein and its tributaries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30617.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>There has been a discussion of&#x000a0;a single medial incision approach with sparing of the calcaneocuboid joint for hindfoot arthrodesis (called a "medial double").<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30617.r3">[3]</xref> &#x000a0;The advantages of this include avoiding lateral structures, avoiding non-union of the calcaneocuboid joint,&#x000a0;decreased OR time, and decreased operating costs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30617.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30617.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0; The disadvantages of this approach may be increased dissection, damaging the vasculature supplying the talar body.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30617.r2">[2]</xref></p>

        <p>Many conditions may be treated using other motion-preserving procedures, so the decision to perform the triple arthrodesis is always dependant on patient condition, disease progression, and surgeon preference.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-30617.s5" sec-type="Contraindications">
        <title>Contraindications</title>
        <p>Absolute contraindications to the triple arthrodesis include the presence of an active infection, acute Charcot arthropathy, arterial insufficiency, and others. Acute Charcot arthropathy can be determined via physical exam with possible bounding pedal pulses, increased lower extremity temperature, localized edema, and loss of protective sensation. Additionally, a positive history of neuropathy, radiographs showing disorganized osteolysis and lab markers such as increased ESR increase the likelihood of this diagnosis. Relative contraindications include uncontrolled comorbidities, presence of ankle arthritis, lack of trial of conservative therapy, and others. As with any procedure, careful patient selection and management of post-operative goals must take place to achieve an optimal outcome.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-30617.s6" sec-type="Equipment">
        <title>Equipment</title>
        <p>Equipment for the triple arthrodesis includes standard hardware for most arthrodesis procedures of the rearfoot and ankle.&#x000a0;Screws from 6.5 mm to 8mm screws may serve for fixation of the subtalar joint, 4.5 mm screws may be used to fixate the midtarsal joints.&#x000a0; Specialty equipment from many manufacturers exists, include plates and staples for the midtarsal joint. A thigh tourniquet is used for hemostasis during the procedure, and intraoperative fluoroscopy is recommended for confirmation of joint positioning and proper fixation. A distraction device such as a lamina spreader or Hintermann distractor may be useful.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-30617.s7" sec-type="Personnel">
        <title>Personnel</title>
        <p>The procedure may be performed by a single surgeon, although a team approach ensures optimal patient outcomes.&#x000a0;Perioperative nursing team, anesthesia team, and a radiology technician are also required. Post-procedure evaluation by physical therapy can assist in achieving patient long term pain relief and functional goals.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-30617.s8" sec-type="Preparation">
        <title>Preparation</title>
        <p>A full biomechanical evaluation is crucial to optimal success.&#x000a0;The ankle joint must be evaluated to see if an adequate range of motion exists to support an arthrodesis of the midfoot. The entire lower extremity must also be assessed to plan for proper intra-op and post-op positioning of the foot. This process involves a gait analysis with both the knee, ankle, and foot position evaluated.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Typically, the foot upon weight-bearing and in the progression of gait abducts approximately 10&#x000a0;to 15 degrees. If the knee is rectus with the foot abducted 15 degrees, it may be advisable to abduct the foot in its final position to 30 degrees; this would be 15 degrees abduction from the line of gait. However, if the knee is laterally positioned 15 degrees during the base of gait, it may be advised to position the foot in a rectus position.</p>
        <p>Pre-operative radiographs include a weight-bearing dorsoplantar, medial oblique, and lateral view. These views can help assess overall joint quality, joint positioning needing to be corrected to obtain a rectus foot, and potential wedging or required grafting during the procedure.&#x000a0; A calcaneal axial view may also be obtained to assess the degree of correction in regards to calcaneal valgus or varus. If questioning the integrity of the subtalar joint, one can get a CT scan to evaluate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30617.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;Alternatively, in-office weight-bearing CT scans are gaining in popularity to assess. Other imaging modalities that are obtainable include an MRI for evaluation of soft tissue structures, including the posterior tibial tendon, DEXA scan in the assessment of osteoporosis, or scanogram in the evaluation of limb length deformities. The decision for performing the surgery has its basis on both the patient's complaint of pain, overall disease progression, gait analysis, and radiographs.</p>
        <p>Adequate patient counseling must take place before the procedure. With the fusion of the joints of the rearfoot, the patient will have difficulty walking on uneven surfaces, possible difficulty going downstairs, and a change in gait pattern. Patients must know that the post-procedure recovery may take six months to a year until fully recovered.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-30617.s9" sec-type="Technique or Treatment">
        <title>Technique or Treatment</title>
        <p>The patient is positioned supine with a thigh tourniquet.&#x000a0; General anesthesia is recommended.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The procedure&#x000a0;begins laterally, careful to avoid the sural and intermediate dorsal cutaneous nerve, starting at the distal tip of the fibula and carried until the base of the fourth and fifth metatarsal. The incision is continued deep, until the arrival of the fascia overlying the extensor digitorum brevis muscle.&#x000a0; A communicating branch of the sural nerve to the intermediate cutaneous branch can be encountered at this point and may have to be sacrificed to proceed. The extensor digitorum brevis then gets reflected off of its origination on the sinus tarsi. Peroneal tendons may be retracted plantarly.</p>
        <p>The&#x000a0;sinus tarsi may then be identified and excavated.&#x000a0;Fibrofatty tissue in the sinus tarsi (Hoke's tonsil) must be removed for adequate exposure of the subtalar joint. All subtalar joint attachments must be released, including the interosseous ligament, to expose the anterior and middle facets.</p>
        <p>Following the former incision distally, the calcaneal cuboid joint will be identified, and its dorsal ligaments&#x000a0;must be released.</p>
        <p>Following this, the medial incision will be placed between the medial gutter of the ankle and extended to the inferior aspect of the navicular. The great saphenous vein is often in this area and retractable superiorly.&#x000a0; The capsular tissue of the talonavicular joint can be incised in line with the incision, leaving the attachment of the posterior tibial tendon intact. A cobb elevator is often useful in exposing the entire aspect of the joint.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Resection of the talonavicular joint&#x000a0;can be performed using a variety of methods.&#x000a0; Curettes or osteotomes may be used for cartilage resection and exposure of subchondral bone, maintaining the original contour of the joint.&#x000a0; Adequate resection of cartilage and fenestration of the bone is crucial to ensure satisfactory osseous union.</p>
        <p>Once the talonavicular joint is prepped, resection then continues at the calcaneocuboid joint.&#x000a0; Once again, curettes or osteotomes are options, or a sagittal saw can be employed.&#x000a0; If transverse plane deformity of the foot exists, a wedge of the calcaneus can be taken for correction.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Finally, the subtalar joint gets prepped for arthrodesis. The posterior facet can be prepped using curettage, osteotome, or a rotary burr to ensure adequate subchondral bone exposure.&#x000a0; If the middle facet has been exposed, it too can be resected using this method.&#x000a0; If a bone graft is employed for wedging, it can be placed for deformity correction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30617.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>After prepping all joints, the talonavicular joint can undergo manual manipulation and then fixated temporarily using Kirschner wires or Steinmann pins.&#x000a0; Following this, the subtalar joint and calcaneocuboid can be temporarily fixated using the same methods.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Ensuring the foot is in the optimal position for fusion, the subtalar joint is then permanently fixated.&#x000a0; For fixation, screws can be used from a posterior and lateral angle on the calcaneus extending to the dorsal medial aspect of the talus.&#x000a0; The talonavicular joint can then be fixated using screws from a distal and inferior aspect of the navicular into the head of the talus. The calcaneocuboid joint can finally be fixated utilizing a variety of hardware options.</p>
        <p>The final position of the foot should be the following: heel in neutral to slight eversion, midtarsal joint in slight valgus.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Incisions are then irrigated and closed using anatomically layered closure.&#x000a0; Skin closure can be through many methods. A drain may be used to prevent hematoma formation. Patients are typically placed in a splint and are non-weight bearing following the procedure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-30617.r9">[9]</xref></p>
