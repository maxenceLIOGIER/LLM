        <title>Continuing Education Activity</title>
        <p>Healthcare providers in Pennsylvania must adhere to the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law (CPSL), 23 Pa.C.S. Chapter 63 (relating to child protective services) when recognizing and reporting suspected child abuse. The CPSL was established in 1975 to protect children from abuse, allow the opportunity for healthy growth and development, and preserve and stabilize the family whenever possible. This activity outlines the categories and common indicators of child abuse, as well as the requirements and procedures for reporting suspected child abuse.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Objectives:</bold>

        <p content-type="pubmed-excerpt">Healthcare providers in Pennsylvania are mandated reporters of suspected child abuse; if a mandated reporter has reasonable cause to suspect a child was or is a victim of child abuse, the mandated reporter must immediately make a report of suspected child abuse in accordance with the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law (CPSL), <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/LEGIS/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&#x00026;ttl=23&#x00026;div=00.&#x00026;chpt=063.&#x00026;CFID=246217912&#x00026;CFTOKEN=44782272">23 Pa.C.S.

<bold>Child Abuse/Neglect&#x000a0;In&#x000a0;The State Of Pennsylvania</bold>
</p>
        <p>In the US, over 3 million children per year are abused or neglected. In Pennsylvania, over 40,000 are the subjects of reports, and approximately 1 in 1000 children are abused or neglected.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-128082.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>The Pennsylvania child welfare system is state-supervised and county-administered. The two main functions of the county children-and-youth agencies are Child Protective Services (CPS) and General Protective Services (GPS).</p>
        <p>
<bold>Child Protective Services Versus General Protective Services</bold>
</p>
        <p>CPS are services and activities provided by the department and each county agency for child abuse cases. Cases identified as &#x0201c;CPS&#x0201d; require an investigation because the alleged act or failure to act meets the PA CPSL&#x02019;s definition of child abuse. The PA CPSL&#x02019;s definition of child abuse recognizes 10 separate categories of child abuse.GPS are services and activities each county agency provides for cases requiring protective services as defined by PA DHS in regulations. Cases identified as &#x0201c;GPS&#x0201d; require an assessment for services and supports. In these cases, the alleged act or failure to act does not meet the definition of child abuse but is still detrimental to a child. The primary purpose of GPS is to protect the rights and welfare of children so that they have an opportunity for healthy growth and development.</p>

        <p>Each year, millions of children are&#x000a0;investigated by CPS for&#x000a0;child abuse and neglect in the United States. Annually, more than 3 million children are the subjects of child maltreatment reports. Of those,&#x000a0;20% were found to have evidence of maltreatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-128082.r7">[7]</xref> Annually, there are more than 100,000 referrals for abuse and neglect in Pennsylvania, with nearly half of them confirmed victims. Male and female percentages of victims are similar. Children younger than 3 are at the highest risk. African Americans and Native Americans have the highest rate of abuse and neglect. Of those abused, approximately 75% are neglected, 15&#x000a0;to 20% are physically abused, and 5&#x000a0;to 10% are sexually abused.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-128082.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-128082.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-128082.r8">[8]</xref></p>

<bold>Exclusions to Child Abuse</bold>
</p>
        <p>Nothing in the PA CPSL requires a person who has reasonable cause to suspect a child is a victim of child abuse to consider the exclusions from child abuse before making a report of suspected child abuse. Exclusions from child abuse are considered/determined by DHS or the investigating agency after receipt of a referral/report.</p>
        <p><bold>1. Environmental Factors:</bold> No child shall be deemed to be physically or mentally abused based on injuries that result solely from environmental factors, such as inadequate housing, furnishings, income, clothing, and medical care, that are beyond the control of the parent or person responsible for the child&#x02019;s welfare with whom the child resides. This exclusion does not apply to any childcare service under the CPSL, excluding an adoptive parent.</p>
        <p><bold>2.&#x000a0;Practice of Religious Beliefs:</bold> If, upon investigation, the county agency determines that a child has not been provided needed medical or surgical care because of sincerely held religious beliefs of the child&#x02019;s parents or relative within the third degree of consanguinity and with whom the child resides, which beliefs are consistent with those of a bona fide religion, the child shall not be deemed to be physically or mentally abused. In such cases, the following shall apply:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>The county agency shall closely monitor the child and the child&#x02019;s family and shall seek court-ordered medical intervention when the lack of medical or surgical care threatens the child&#x02019;s life or long-term health.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>All correspondence with a subject of the report and the records of the department and the county agency shall not reference child abuse and shall acknowledge the religious basis for the child&#x02019;s condition.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>The family shall be referred for general protective services if appropriate.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>This exclusion shall not apply if the failure to provide needed medical or surgical care causes the death of the child.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>This exclusion shall not apply to any child-care service as defined under the CPSL, excluding an adoptive parent.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p><bold>3.&#x000a0;Use of force for Supervision, Control, and Safety Purposes:</bold> Subject to the "Rights of Parents" exclusion, the use of reasonable force on or against a child by the child&#x02019;s parent or person responsible for the child&#x02019;s welfare shall not be considered child abuse if any of the following conditions apply:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>The use of reasonable force constitutes incidental, minor, or reasonable physical contact with the child or other actions designed to maintain order and control.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>The use of reasonable force is necessary
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>to quell a disturbance or remove the child from the scene of a disturbance that threatens physical injury to persons or damage to property,</p></list-item><list-item><p>to prevent the child from self-inflicted physical harm,</p></list-item><list-item><p>for self-defense or the defense of another individual, or</p></list-item><list-item><p>to obtain possession of weapons or other dangerous objects or controlled substances or paraphernalia that are on the child or within the control of the child.</p></list-item></list>
</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p><bold>4.&#x000a0;Rights of Parents:</bold> Nothing in the CPSL shall be construed to restrict the generally recognized existing rights of parents to use reasonable force on or against their children for the purposes of supervision, control, and discipline of their children. Such reasonable force shall not constitute child abuse</p>
        <p><bold>5. Participation in Events that Involve Physical Contact with a Child:</bold> An individual participating in a practice or competition in an interscholastic sport, physical education, a recreational activity or extracurricular activity that involves physical contact with a child does not, in itself, constitute contact that is subject to the reporting requirements under the CPSL.</p>
        <p>

<bold>Confidential&#x000a0;Communications - Clergy</bold>
</p>
        <p>Confidential communications made to a member of the clergy are protected. Please note the following:</p>
        <p>Pennsylvania courts have interpreted our clergy-communicant privilege as applying only to confidential communications between a communicant and a clergy member in his or her role as confessor or spiritual counselor. See, e.g., Hutchison v. Luddy, 414 Pa.Super. 138, 146, 606 A.2d 905, 908 (1992); Commonwealth v. Patterson, 392 Pa.Super. 331, 572 A.2d 1258 (1990); Fahlfeder v. Commonwealth, Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole, 80 Pa.Cmwlth. 86, 470 A.2d 1130 (1984).&#x000a0;In summary, if the communication is in confidence and the person seeks absolution, it is considered privileged.</p>
        <p>
<bold>
<bold>Confidential Communications - Attorney</bold>
</bold>
</p>
        <p>Confidential communication to an attorney is protected under Pennsylvania law SO LONG AS they are within the scope of confidentiality as per 42 Pa.C.S. &#x000a7;&#x000a7;5916 and 5928.</p>
        <p>Relating to confidentiality in criminal proceedings, neither the attorney nor the client is required or permitted to disclose confidential discussions between the&#x000a0;2 parties unless the client waives this privilege.</p>
        <p>Relating to confidentiality in civil proceedings, neither the attorney nor the client is required or permitted to disclose confidential discussions between the&#x000a0;2 parties unless the client waives this privilege.</p>
        <p>
<bold>The Reporting Process</bold>
</p>
        <p>A mandated reporter must immediately make an oral report of suspected child abuse to DHS via the Statewide toll-free telephone number (1-800-932-0313) or a written report via the self-service Child Welfare Portal (http://www.compass.state.pa.us/cwis).A mandated reporter making an oral report of suspected child abuse to the department via the Statewide toll-free telephone number under section 6332 (relating to the establishment of a statewide toll-free telephone number) shall also make a written report, which may be submitted electronically, within 48 hours to DHS or county agency assigned to the case in a manner and format prescribed by DHS.The failure of the mandated reporter to file the written report described in the paragraph immediately above shall not relieve the county agency from any duty under the PA CPSL, and the county agency shall proceed as though the mandated reporter complied.Mandated reporters are required to identify themselves and their contact information when making a report of suspected child abuse. This provides documentation that the report was made but is also helpful so that the children-and-youth caseworker can contact the mandated reporter if clarification on the situation or additional information is needed.</p>
        <p><bold>Contents of Report</bold>A written report of suspected child abuse, which may be submitted electronically, shall include the following information if known:</p>

        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>Any child younger than two years old, for whom there is a concern of physical abuse/bodily injury, should have a skeletal survey as part of the evaluation. Additionally, any sibling younger than two years of age of an abused child should also have a skeletal survey. A skeletal survey consists of 21 dedicated views, as recommended by the American College of Radiology. The views include anteroposterior (AP) and lateral aspects of the skull; lateral spine; AP, right posterior oblique, left posterior oblique of chest/rib technique; AP pelvis; AP of each femur; AP of each leg; AP of each humerus; AP of each forearm; posterior and anterior views of each hand; AP (dorsoventral) of each foot.&#x000a0;If the findings are abnormal or equivocal, a follow-up survey is indicated in 2 weeks to visualize healing patterns.</p>
        <p>Laboratory evaluation may be performed to rule out other diseases as causes of the injuries. These can including bone (calcium, magnesium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase), hematology (CBC), coagulation (PT, PTT, INR), metabolic (glucose, BUN, creatinine, albumin, protein), liver (AST, ALT), pancreatic (amylase and lipase), and bleeding diathesis (von Willebrand antigen, von Willebrand activity, Factor VIII, Factor IX, and platelet function assays).</p>
        <p>One should consider that the most common differential diagnosis of non-accidental injury is an accidental injury.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-128082.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-128082.r10">[10]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-128082.r11">[11]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-128082.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-128082.r6">[6]</xref></p>

        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>Initial management of an abused child involves stabilization, including assessing the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation. Once&#x000a0;sure that the&#x000a0;patient is stable, a complete history and physical examination are necessary.&#x000a0;A mandated reporter who has reasonable cause to suspect a child is a victim of child abuse must immediately make a report of suspected child abuse to ChildLine immediately. If there is a child abuse specialist at the pediatric center, their involvement would be optimal. If the patient is seen in an outpatient setting, there may be a need to transfer the patient to a hospital for laboratory and radiologic evaluation and the appropriate&#x000a0;continuation of care. Even if a child was transferred to another physician or facility, the physician first involved with the patient care is still responsible for being a mandated reporter. Nothing under section 6311 of the PA CPSL (relating to persons required to report suspected child abuse) requires a mandated reporter to identify the person responsible for the child abuse to make a report of suspected child abuse. The physician should continue to advocate for the child, ensuring that the patient receives the appropriate follow-up services.</p>
        <p>Victims of sexual abuse should have their physical, mental, and psychosocial needs addressed. Baseline sexually transmitted infection (STI) and pregnancy testing should be performed, as well as empiric treatment for HIV, gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomonas, and bacterial vaginosis infection for adolescent victims. This management is possible if the patients&#x000a0;present within 72 hours of the incident to receive appropriate&#x000a0;care and emergency contraception if desired. Prepubertal patients are not provided with prophylactic treatment due to the low incidence of STIs in this age group. Urgent evaluation (optimally in less than 72 hours) can prove extremely beneficial for patients needing prophylactic treatment, patients with anogenital injury, for collection of forensic evidence, for patients needing urgent child protection, and in those having suicidal ideation or any other form of symptom and/or injury requiring urgent medical care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-128082.r12">[12]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-128082.r13">[13]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-128082.r14">[14]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-128082.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-128082.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-128082.r8">[8]</xref></p>

        <title>Differential Diagnosis</title>
        <p>Suspected child abuse should be considered in the evaluation of all injuries of children. A thorough history of the present illness is vital to make a correct diagnosis. Essential aspects of collecting the history involve gathering information about the child's behavior before, during, and after the injury.

        <p>
<bold>Case Scenario #1</bold>
</p>
        <p>
<bold>A 4-year-old child is admitted to the hospital for a third episode of hypoglycemia and lethargy. Prior workup has been unable to determine an organic cause. The child is observed in the hospital for three days, and no underlying pathologic process is discovered. The mother stays with the child, is extremely protective, and engages in making sure "all stones are overturned" to find the cause of the child's condition. The child is set for discharge in the morning at 4 am. While making rounds, the nurse finds the mother wide awake&#x000a0;standing at the bedside. During her examination, the child has a&#x000a0;seizure. A bedside rapid blood sugar test reveals a dangerously low level. Glucagon is administered, and the child recovers quickly. What should the nurse do?</bold>
</p>
        <p>In this case, there is reasonable cause to suspect child abuse, specifically "fabricating, feigning, or intentionally exaggerating or inducing medical symptoms or disease which results in potentially harmful medical evaluation or treatment to a child through any recent act," as well as a basis to report. A nurse is a mandated reporter of suspected child abuse and is therefore required to make a report of suspected child abuse to Childline via phone at 1-800-932-0313 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) or electronically via the Child Welfare Portal at www.compass.state.pa.us/cwis, if there is reasonable cause to suspect that a child is a victim of child abuse, and they come into contact with the child in the course of employment, occupation, and practice of a profession or through a regularly scheduled program, activity, or service, or they are directly responsible for the care, supervision, guidance or training of the child, or are affiliated with an agency, institution, organization, school, regularly established church or religious organization or other entity that is directly responsible for the care, supervision, guidance or training of the child. Given the gravity of the situation, clinicians and social workers should also be contacted in this hospital setting.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Case Scenario #2</bold>
</p>
        <p>
<bold>A 13-year-old girl is brought to her pediatrician because of a recent decline in her grades. During a private interview, she admits she has "problems with boys at school" and "bad dreams about boys always staring at her." The child privately admits she regularly gets up in the middle of the night and sleeps with the biological mother on her side of the bed, with her stepfather next to her mother. The child indicates the stepfather has commented that she is a "looker," has "big headlights," and needs to "fend off the boys at school." The pediatrician attended high school with the stepfather and knows he is not the "brightest bulb" but seems to care about the child genuinely. The child indicates the stepfather wears pajamas, has never touched her, and always knocks before entering the bathroom or her room. She says she is very anxious about attending school and is afraid to speak with her mother about her school problems. She says her stepfather has always been "very good" to her mother and is always kind and considerate to her as well. She does not want to get him into trouble but feels his comments about her appearance add to her anxiety. What should the pediatrician do in this situation?</bold>
</p>
        <p>Given the totality of the circumstances, there may not be reasonable cause to suspect child abuse; however, there remain numerous concerns, such as the child's problems at school, nightmares, child co-sleeping at the age of 13, and the stepfather's inappropriate comments to the child. General concerns for a child's safety, health, and well-being may be reported to ChildLine for assessment of services and support.&#x000a0;The PA CPSL prescribes that a person, hospital, institution, school, facility, agency, or agency employee acting in good faith shall have immunity from civil and criminal liability that might otherwise result from making a report of suspected child abuse or making a referral for general protective services, regardless of whether the report is required to be made under the PA CPSL.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Case Scenario #3</bold>
</p>
        <p>
<bold>A 16-year-old child presents to the emergency department due to acting out at school. Shortly after arrival, the child asks for a sandwich. The school could not reach the biological mother, and the biological father is deceased. The child indicates his mother is on a honeymoon on a boat somewhere in the Cayman Islands. He is currently being taken care of by his grandmother, who is at work as a dietician, but she will be home shortly. The mother left him with $200 ten days ago and told him to buy local fast food for both of them for dinner. He admits he was told not to spend more than $20 daily and avoid dessert due to his grandmother's diabetes. He says he is out of money because he bought dessert daily and spent $30 instead of $20. He says he is "starving." There is no food in the house besides the fruits, vegetables, and frozen meals his mother provided. Which of the following would be an appropriate response of the emergency department health providers?</bold>
</p>
        <p>The child should be given food, and the grandmother should be contacted. Additionally, while there may not be reasonable cause to suspect child abuse, the PA CPSL prescribes that a person, hospital, institution, school, facility, agency, or agency employee acting in good faith shall have immunity from civil and criminal liability that might otherwise result from making a report of suspected child abuse or making a referral for general protective services, regardless of whether the report is required to be made under the PA CPSL. General concerns for a child's safety, health, and well-being may be reported to ChildLine for assessment of services and support.</p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>Child abuse is a public health problem that leads to lifelong health consequences, both physically and psychologically. Physically, those who undergo abusive head trauma may have neurologic deficits, developmental delays, cerebral palsy, and other forms of disability. Psychologically, child abuse patients tend to&#x000a0;have higher rates of depression, conduct disorder, and substance abuse. Academically, these children may perform poorly at school and have decreased cognitive function.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>All&#x000a0;healthcare&#x000a0;providers have a legal, medical, and moral obligation to report suspected abuse. Most child abuse&#x000a0;cases present&#x000a0;to the emergency department; hence, nurses and physicians in the&#x000a0;emergency department&#x000a0;are often the first to notice the problem. The key is to be aware of the problem; allowing abused children to return to their parents usually leads to more violence and sometimes even death.&#x000a0;The social worker must be informed of suspected child abuse so that the child can be followed as an outpatient.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Evidence-Based Outcomes</bold>
</p>
        <p>Child abuse is a serious problem in many countries. While there is an acute awareness of the problem, many children fail to be referred or reported and consequently&#x000a0;continue to suffer abuse, sometimes even death. In a busy emergency room, healthcare workers must be vigilant of abuse in any child who presents with injuries that&#x000a0;are inconsistent or unexplainable.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-128082.r41">[41]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-128082.r42">[42]</xref> Studies have shown that the incidence of morbidity and mortality can be decreased through prevention and treatment. The goal is to prevent abuse and neglect, allowing a healthy childhood that will result in healthy adults.&#x000a0;Society, community, and individual health providers must work together to provide a safe environment for children. Reporting suspected child abuse is an obligation of all health professionals as it is an opportunity to improve a child's health, safety, and well-being.</p>
