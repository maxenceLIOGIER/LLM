        <p>Nevus flammeus or port-wine stain is a capillary malformation usually presenting as a unilateral pink or red discoloration on the skin. These birthmarks, which can vary in size and shape, typically develop at birth or shortly afterward and can occur anywhere on the body of a newborn, although&#x000a0;they are most commonly found on the face and neck. Over time, they may grow in size, darken, or become thicker. The color intensity can also change with age. Nevus flammeus is a benign condition that often occurs alone and is only of cosmetic concern. However, when it is a part of a combined vascular malformation or a syndrome, the patient will require further evaluation, including radiological imaging, to confirm the diagnosis. Initiating appropriate treatment is crucial to prevent the development/ progress of any disabilities and prompt diagnosis of any anticipated complications/ visceral anomalies. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of nevus flammeus and highlights the role of an interprofessional team in the management of affected&#x000a0;patients.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Nevus flammeus or port-wine stain (PWS) is a non-neoplastic congenital dermal capillary hamartomatous malformation presenting as a pink or red patch on a newborn's skin. It is a congenital skin condition that can affect any part of the body and persists throughout life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r1">[1]</xref> The&#x000a0;nevus flammeus is a well-defined, often unilateral, bilateral, or centrally positioned pink to red patch that appears on the face at birth and is made up of distorted capillary-like vessels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r2">[2]</xref> It needs to be differentiated from a nevus simplex/salmon patch, which is usually seen along the midline and disappears over time.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;An acquired port-wine stain, clinically and histopathologically indistinguishable from congenital capillary malformation, has been reported to develop in adolescents or adults, usually following trauma.</p>
        <p>Although nevus flammeus is a benign lesion, and often the diagnosis is clinical, occasionally detailed evaluation and radiological imaging are required when associated with other skin, soft tissue, skeletal, and vascular anomalies.</p>

        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>The etiology of nevus flammeus is yet to be clearly defined. Most cases are sporadic; however, familial cases have also been reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r1">[1]</xref> The advances made in the field of genetics have been instrumental in determining the genetic basis of some of the syndromic and non-syndromic forms of nevus flammeus. A somatic activating mutation in GNAQ (located on chromosome 9; locus 9q21.2) has been demonstrated in isolated nevus flammeus and Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r1">[1]</xref></p>

        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>A port-wine stain (PWS) is one of the most common vascular anomalies. It almost always presents at birth, affecting 0.3% to 0.5% of newborns, often in the head and neck region. No gender predilection has been noted.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r9">[9]</xref></p>

        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>Understanding the ultrastructural changes and molecular profile of endothelial cells of blood vessels in the affected skin and uncovering the genetic basis of vascular malformations have been crucial to better comprehending this congenital skin condition. Congenital weakness of vessel walls, defects in perivascular dermal elements, abnormalities in neuromodulation, and dysmorphogenesis of cephalic neuroectoderm are some theories used to explain the origin of this vascular malformation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>The 2 major hypotheses, with evidence from recent studies in their favor, are defective nerve innervations to dermal blood vessels and genetic mutations leading to dysregulation of angiogenic signaling.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r9">[9]</xref> Vessels in PWS lack normal nerve innervations, as evident from the significant decrease in S-100 positive nerve fibers, affecting only the vessels in the dermis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r9">[9]</xref> Consequently, there is a decrease in the basal tone of the vessel and/or loss of neurotrophic factors, resulting in the pathological changes of PWS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;It has been proposed that there is a&#x000a0;defective maturation of the sympathetic fibers in the dermal vessels that happens embryologically, which results in the loss of sympathetic control, which in turn leads to vascular ectasia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r10">[10]</xref></p>
        <p>Dermal blood vessels in PWS coexpress both arterial marker (EfnB2) and venous marker (EphB1), which lead to aberrations in the normal differentiation of the primary capillary plexus into dermal arterioles and venules. The result is a venule-like vasculature that undergoes progressive dilatation. Abnormal activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways, which play a key role in angiogenesis, have also been implicated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r9">[9]</xref> Mutations in RASA1, GNAQ, EphB4, and EphB1/ EfnB2 coexpression are some of the inciting factors for this abnormal activation.</p>

        <p>Dilated, ectatic capillaries and postcapillary venules of variable calibers in the papillary and upper reticular dermis are seen in the histology of a PWS.

        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>PWS is the most common vascular malformation, typically presenting as pink or red homogenous, variably sized macules and patches with geographic borders at birth that persist throughout life. It is painless, does not bleed spontaneously, and is not warm to touch. In 70% to 90% of cases, it affects the skin over the head and neck; however, it can be seen over the trunk or extremities and can rarely involve the mucosa.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;The lesions can be single or multiple, unilateral or bilateral, localized or widespread. Over the face, it is usually segmental, conforming to the trigeminal nerve distribution (see <bold>Image.</bold> Port Wine Stain). It increases in size proportionate to the physical growth of the child. With age, the lesions darken and acquire a purple hue. Thickening and hypertrophy can be seen most commonly with facial PWS later in life with or without nodularity due to progressive ectasia of dermal vessels.&#x000a0;Patients can rarely develop hyperplasia of underlying fat, muscle, and bone, predominantly with facial PWS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>PWS over the midline lumbosacral area could be a cutaneous marker of occult spinal dysraphism. Imaging studies are indicated when PWS is associated with other cutaneous markers like a tuft of hair, hemangioma, lipoma, dermoid cyst, and true/pseudo tail.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r13">[13]</xref></p>
        <p>In 1949, Fegeler described skin lesions that were morphologically and histopathologically similar to PWS developing following trauma. This infrequently reported clinical entity, which shows a better response to pulsed dye laser, is called Fegeler syndrome or acquired PWS. The commonly reported trigger is trauma; other triggers that have been described are the use of drugs like isotretinoin, oral contraceptive pills, simvastatin, metformin, frostbite injury, herpes zoster infection, and obstruction of a peritoneovenous shunt.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r14">[14]</xref></p>
        <p>PWS often occurs as an isolated vascular malformation; however, in an individual with other congenital disabilities, it could be a part of a genetic syndrome.&#x000a0;Some of these syndromes, with a brief description of their hallmark clinical features, are listed below.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS)</bold>
</p>
        <p>Sturge-Weber syndrome is a neurocutaneous syndrome characterized by PWS, leptomeningeal angiomatosis, and/or eye involvement. The PWS is usually unilateral and along the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. However, it can occasionally be bilateral, extensive, and sometimes involve the trunk and the extremities. Children with SWS often develop seizures by the age of 2 years that can be associated with contralateral neurological deficits and learning difficulties. Imaging&#x000a0;of the brain may show cerebral atrophy with gyriform calcifications, described as a "tram-track sign" (see <bold>Image.</bold> Sturge-Weber Syndrome). In the eye, choroid angioma can lead to complications like glaucoma, buphthalmos, and retinal detachment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r6">[6]</xref></p>
        <p>A facial nevus flammeus, including any area of the forehead, including the upper eyelid and the midline frontonasal prominence, is the greatest indicator of SWS. The long-held notion that the distribution has a "trigeminal nerve" etiology is challenged by the observation that it appears to follow the patterns of embryological vasculature. Notably, not all patients with nevus flammeus will&#x000a0;develop SWS; however,&#x000a0;forehead location is the strongest independent predictor.</p>

<bold>Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS)</bold>
</p>
        <p>Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome&#x000a0;is a sporadic condition characterized by a combined capillary-lymphatic-venous malformation with bone and soft tissue hypertrophy. The lower limbs are the most common site involved. Persistence of the embryonic vein of the lateral thigh (vein of Servelle) and stenosis/hypoplasia/aplasia of the deep venous system predisposes the patients to localized intravascular coagulopathy and thromboembolism with subsequent risk of pulmonary arterial hypertension.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>CLOVES Syndrome</bold>
</p>
        <p>CLOVES syndrome is characterized by <bold>c</bold>ongenital <bold>l</bold>ipomatous <bold>o</bold>vergrowth, <bold>v</bold>ascular malformations, <bold>e</bold>pidermal nevi, and <bold>s</bold>pinal/skeletal anomalies. Capillary, lymphatic, venous malformations, or combined malformations are often seen in these patients. In rare cases, spinal arteriovenous malformations have also been described. The lipomatous masses are usually present over the trunk, and vascular malformations are often present within or overlying these masses. There can be a focal or segmental overgrowth of the extremities with predominant fibroadipose components. Scoliosis, macrodactyly, and sandal-gap deformity are some of the skeletal anomalies seen. Associated neurological impairment and visceral anomalies have also been described in some cases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Proteus Syndrome</bold>
</p>
        <p>Capillary, venous, or lymphatic malformation with progressive, severely deforming overgrowth of body parts, bony hypertrophy, dysregulated adipose tissue, and epidermal nevi are typically seen in Proteus syndrome. The hallmark feature of this syndrome is the cerebriform connective tissue thickening over the soles and palms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r6">[6]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Diffuse Capillary Malformation with Overgrowth (DCMO)</bold>
</p>
        <p>Diffuse capillary malformation with overgrowth is a recently described clinical entity that falls in the spectrum of vascular anomalies with overgrowth. Patients can have a widespread reticulated capillary malformation affecting multiple contiguous sites, with a sharp midline demarcation associated with non-progressive soft tissue and/or bony hypertrophy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Capillary Malformation-Arteriovenous Malformation Syndrome (CM-AVM)</bold>
</p>
        <p>Capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome&#x000a0;is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by RASA1 mutation. A few cases with EPHB4 mutation have also been described. It is a&#x000a0;combined vascular malformation characterized by multiple PWSs and arteriovenous malformation (AVM) or fistulas. Multiple PWSs that are multifocal, randomly distributed, pink-to-reddish brown colored, of variable size, with geographical margins, and with a pale/white halo are seen in the affected individual at birth or later in life. AVM may be present in the skin, muscle, bone, spine, or brain in one-third of these patients. Depending on the site, they can have various symptoms or life-threatening complications. Pain, bleeding, congestive heart failure, and neurological symptoms are some complications seen in CM-AVM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Parkes-Weber Syndrome</bold>
</p>
        <p>Parkes-Weber syndrome is characterized by multiple arteriovenous fistulas with bone and soft tissue hypertrophy, usually affecting the extremities. A RASA1 mutation is seen in patients having associated PWS; hence, it is considered a variant of CM-AVM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r16">[16]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Macrocephaly-Capillary Malformation Syndrome (MCM)</bold>
</p>
        <p>Macrocephaly-capillary malformation syndrome<bold>&#x000a0;</bold>is characterized by megalencephaly, brain and body asymmetry, capillary malformations, digital anomalies, and brain malformations. Often, PWS is seen on the central face, and patients can have seizures, developmental delay, and joint laxity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Phakomatosis Pigmentovascularis (PPV)</bold>
</p>
        <p>Phakomatosis pigmentovascularis&#x000a0;is characterized by the coexistence of extensive capillary malformation and pigmented nevi. Five types of PPVs have been described based on the type of pigmented nevi (nevus spilus, dermal melanocytosis, epidermal nevus) and capillary malformation. Each type is further divided into&#x000a0;2 subtypes; subtype "a" denotes absence, and subtype "b" denotes the presence of extracutaneous findings. Patients can also have nevus anemicus and caf&#x000e9;-au-lait macules.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Nevus flammeus is a common feature in the first&#x000a0;4&#x000a0;types of&#x000a0; PPV. It is associated with epidermal nevus type I, congenital dermal melanocytosis in type II, and nevus spilus in type III. Both congenital dermal melanocytosis and nevus spilus are seen in PPV type IV. Cutis marmorata telangiectasia congenita is associated with nevus spilus in PPV type V. Among the 5 types, PPV type II is most commonly seen.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r6">[6]</xref> &#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>CLAPO Syndrome</bold>
</p>
        <p>CLAPO syndrome is a combination of <bold>C</bold>apillary vascular malformation of the lower lip, <bold>L</bold>ymphatic malformations of the head and neck, <bold>A</bold>symmetry, and <bold>P</bold>artial or generalized <bold>O</bold>vergrowth. Capillary malformation of the lower lip, usually extending to the adjacent skin, lymphatic malformation of the tongue and neck, and asymmetric partial overgrowth of the face and extremities are the constellation of symptoms seen in this syndrome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r5">[5]</xref></p>

        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>PWS is a vascular birthmark of a benign nature; therefore, reassuring the anxious parents may be the only management required. As the face is commonly affected, many find it cosmetically disfiguring, especially when associated with skin and soft tissue hypertrophy. Vascular-selective lasers are the mainstay of treatment, with the type of laser and laser parameters selected based on the color and thickness of PWS, the patient's skin type, prior treatment, and the response to it.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r12">[12]</xref></p>
        <p>Lasers work on the principle of selective photothermolysis. The laser energy gets preferentially absorbed by hemoglobin (target chromophore), which results in the heating and rupture of red blood cells and blood in the vasculature. Thus, laser energy gets converted into thermal energy, which diffuses to endothelial cells, causing selective damage to microvasculature through mechanical injury and photocoagulation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r12">[12]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r17">[17]</xref>&#x000a0;The objective is complete photocoagulation of ectatic vessels in the lesional skin, which reduces dermal blood content and the lightening of PWS. Treatment initiation as early as infancy is found to have consistent improvement, better outcomes, and decreased risk of cutaneous hypertrophy and disfigurement. A deepening of color may occur, requiring a touch-up treatment later.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r18">[18]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>

        <p>Longer wavelength lasers can penetrate deeper to damage the ectatic vessels located in the reticular dermis, thus justifying the use of alexandrite laser (755-nm) and neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser (1064-nm) in the treatment of darker/thicker/nodular lesions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-27447.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;On the downside, they are associated with a greater risk of scarring and pigmentary changes. The dual sequential wavelength laser (DSWL), which combines PDL and Nd:YAG, emits&#x000a0;2 pulses of different wavelengths with a preselected delay from the same device. This targets vessels in both the superficial and deep dermis, using a lower fluence and thus producing a good response with fewer side effects.&#x000a0;Frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser, though useful, is found to be less efficacious.

        <p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) can be used alone or combined with lasers. PDT selectively targets hypervascular dermal lesions without causing epidermal damage and is comparable in efficacy or even superior to laser treatment.

        <p>Even though a red stain over a newborn's skin is often benign, it can be alarming to the parents. As important as it is to allay their fears, they need to be made aware of the natural evolution of the lesion and anticipated complications. Alert parents should be able to recognize any extracutaneous/systemic symptoms the child develops that allow the child to receive necessary health care early on.</p>
        <p>Regular follow-up should be emphasized in cases like PWS over eyelids, combined vascular malformations, and a syndrome where the risk of complications is high. When indicated, the patient or their parents need to be informed of the treatment options available with their advantages and disadvantages, and they should be counseled regarding the need for early initiation of treatment to improve patient outcomes.</p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>Enhancing patient-centered care, improving outcomes, ensuring patient safety, and enhancing team performance in managing nevus flammeus requires a collaborative approach involving physicians, advanced care practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals.&#x000a0;An interprofessional team may consist of a pediatric dermatologist, primary clinician, radiologist, vascular surgeon, pediatric surgeon, plastic surgeon, and orthopedic surgeon.</p>
        <p>A child with PWS is usually first brought by the parents to a primary clinician who needs to differentiate it from its clinical mimickers.&#x000a0;Health professionals should possess specialized skills related to nevus flammeus, including the ability to accurately diagnose the condition, choose appropriate treatment modalities (eg, laser therapy), and conduct regular assessments of the birthmark's progress. In a diagnostic dilemma, the child needs a referral to a dermatologist who can establish the diagnosis and recognize any possible syndromic association. If SWS is suspected, neurology and ophthalmology opinions should be sought.&#x000a0;Even though PWS occurring alone is considered benign, it can also be rarely associated with complications. Skillful performance of laser procedures, if necessary, is essential to minimize complications.</p>
        <p>Developing a comprehensive strategy for nevus flammeus care involves setting clear goals for patient outcomes, coordinating multidisciplinary care, and creating treatment plans tailored to each patient's unique needs and preferences. This strategy should consider factors such as the location and size of the birthmark, potential syndromic associations, and long-term management.</p>
        <p>Coordinated care ensures that patients receive seamless, timely, and appropriate interventions. Healthcare professionals should collaborate on scheduling appointments, monitoring treatment progress, and addressing potential complications. Care coordination extends to providing emotional support to patients and families facing the psychosocial challenges associated with nevus flammeus.</p>
        <p>By emphasizing these aspects of care,&#x000a0;an interprofessional team can work together to provide patient-centered care for individuals with nevus flammeus. This approach enhances the likelihood of positive outcomes, ensures patient safety, and optimizes team performance, ultimately improving the overall quality of care for this condition.&#x000a0;</p>
