        <p>Conn syndrome, also known as primary hyperaldosteronism, is characterized by excessive secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal glands, leading to hypertension, hypokalemia, and suppressed plasma renin levels. This condition was first described in 1955 in association with aldosterone-producing adenomas, though the term now encompasses both adenomas and adrenal hyperplasia with elevated aldosterone secretion. Patients may present with resistant hypertension and symptoms of hypokalemia such as muscle weakness or cramps. Diagnosing Conn syndrome often involves measuring the aldosterone-to-renin ratio, with confirmatory tests such as salt-loading, fludrocortisone suppression, or captopril suppression being necessary to validate elevated aldosterone levels.</p>
        <p>Participants of this course learn about the pathophysiology, causes, and clinical presentation of Conn syndrome, with a focus on the complexities of diagnosis and the variability of confirmatory testing. The content emphasizes the importance of collaborating with an interprofessional team&#x02014;including endocrinologists, cardiologists, nephrologists, and pharmacists&#x02014;to ensure accurate diagnosis, individualized treatment plans, and long-term management. Effective teamwork enhances patient outcomes by addressing both the hormonal imbalances and associated cardiovascular risks of Conn syndrome.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Conn syndrome was named after JW Conn, who first described it in 1955 in a patient who had hypertension with an aldosterone-producing adenoma. The adenoma is characterized by increased aldosterone secretion from the adrenal glands, suppressed plasma renin, hypertension, and hypokalemia. Later, many other cases of adrenal hyperplasia with inappropriately elevated&#x000a0;aldosterone secretion were described, and now the term primary hyperaldosteronism is used to describe Conn syndrome irrespective of whether the patient has an adenoma or not.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19895.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19895.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>The diagnosis of Conn syndrome is not always easy, but recognition is important as this condition can help cure hypertension with surgical or medical management. However, it is important to distinguish aldosteronoma from idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia. Aldosteronomas are removed surgically, whereas idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia is managed with medications. At the same time, one has to be aware that there are conditions that cause elevated aldosterone levels, including familial disease and aldosterone-producing renin-responsive adenomas. ectopic secretion (from kidneys and ovary) and adrenocortical carcinomas.</p>

In most genetic alterations, the endpoint is calcium influx and membrane depolarization, resulting in aldosterone hypersecretion.</p>

      <sec id="article-19895.s4" sec-type="Epidemiology">
        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>Primary hyperaldosteronism is the most common cause of secondary hypertension and occurs in about 6% to 20% of adult hypertensive individuals and is higher in patients with resistant hypertension. The prevalence of 10% was noted when consecutive patients with hypertension were evaluated. However, the prevalence increased to 30% when the aldosterone-to-renin ratio was used as a screening method in general practice. Aldosterone-producing adenoma&#x000a0;is present in 50% to 60%, and the remaining is idiopathic or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia; this is about&#x000a0;2 times more common in women than in men.</p>

        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>Aldosterone-producing adenomas, bilateral idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia, aldosterone-producing adrenal carcinoma, and familial aldosteronism cause primary hyperaldosteronism. The increased aldosterone potentiates renal sodium reabsorption, water retention, and potassium excretion. The increased sodium reabsorption by the kidneys results in plasma volume expansion, the primary initiating mechanism for hypertension.</p>
        <p>This may induce tissue inflammation and heightened sympathetic drive, with subsequent development of fibrosis in vital organs, such as the heart, kidneys, and vasculature. As a result, this may lead to the development of chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, ischemic heart disease, and congestive heart failure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19895.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19895.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;Besides the elevation in sodium, patients often develop hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Nearly one-fifth of patients with Conn syndrome have impairment in glucose tolerance, which is due to the inhibitory effects of hypokalemia on insulin secretion.</p>

        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>Often, the patients are asymptomatic but may present with symptoms of fatigue, muscle weakness, cramping (secondary to potassium wasting), headaches, and palpitations. They can also have polydipsia and polyuria from hypokalemia-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Many patients are discovered to have Conn syndrome as a result of persistent hypokalemia and hypertension. Others may present with serious arrhythmias after being started on diuretics for hypertension. Finally, some patients present with hypertension that is refractory to treatment.</p>

        <p>Hypokalemia in a hypertensive individual is the most common clue for primary hyperaldosteronism.

The Endocrine Society's clinical practice guidelines do not specify which confirmatory tests should be regarded as the gold standard to confirm or exclude the diagnosis; therefore, different centers perform different tests.</p>

However, CT may provide an incorrect diagnosis because of the common occurrence of non-functional adrenal adenomas (incidentalomas) that may be present in 4% of the general population.</p>

        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>Treatment goals include normalizing blood pressure, electrolytes, and aldosterone levels. The treatment depends on the cause. Unilateral adrenalectomy in patients with a unilateral adenoma (Conn syndrome)&#x000a0;cures hypertension in 30% to 60% of cases, but the mean cure rate is only 19% after unilateral or bilateral adrenalectomy in patients with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism whose treatment mainly is medical. This treatment includes aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone, eplerenone, or other potassium-sparing diuretics like amiloride.</p>
        <p>Patients need to be optimized preoperatively to decrease the risks of elevated blood pressure during surgery. Aldosterone antagonists like eplerenone and spironolactone are associated with survival benefits. Spironolactone is preferred to lower blood pressure as it normalizes serum potassium levels and plasma volume. Low doses of corticosteroids can help control blood pressure in a small group of patients with glucocorticoid-mediated hyperaldosteronism. Nonsurgical treatment is an option for patients who are frail and have numerous comorbidities. In addition, bilateral adrenal hyperplasia is also managed medically. Adrenalectomy is used to excise unilateral lesions. Before surgery, the patient has to be treated with spironolactone for 4 to 6 weeks. Today, laparoscopic adrenalectomy is widely used to excise the adrenal gland.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Results</bold>
</p>
        <p>About&#x000a0;two-thirds&#x000a0;of patients become normotensive after surgery, but the blood pressure may take 6 to 12 months to stabilize. Over 5 years, only about 50% of patients remain normotensive. Those who fail to respond to spironolactone before surgery most likely continue to be hypertensive after surgery.</p>

        <p>The diagnosis and management of Conn syndrome is best done with an interprofessional team. The disorder can be difficult to diagnose because of the lack of standardized tests. In addition, the aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR) may be falsely elevated in patients with chronic kidney disease and patients on potassium supplements or beta-blockers. Diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers may cause false-negative results. If the clinical suspicion is high, ARR should be repeated after holding these agents for&#x000a0;2 weeks.</p>
        <p>Unilateral adrenalectomy in patients with a unilateral adenoma (Conn syndrome)&#x000a0;cures hypertension in 30% to 60% of cases, but the mean cure rate is only 19% after unilateral or bilateral adrenalectomy in patients with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism whose treatment mainly is medical. This treatment includes aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone or eplerenone or other potassium-sparing diuretics like amiloride. Due to the challenges of managing this disease, the pharmacist should be involved in diuretic selection and dosing.</p>
        <p>The pharmacist should check for drug-drug interaction and report concerns to the clinical interprofessional team. The&#x000a0;clinicians monitoring the patient should be familiar with the pathophysiology and expected abnormalities in laboratory testing. Due to the precarious challenges of abnormal potassium, the&#x000a0;clinician&#x000a0;should be prepared to report to the clinical team quickly any untoward abnormalities as daily lab screens are reported. The best results can be achieved only through interprofessional team involvement and close monitoring.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-19895.r10">[10]</xref></p>
