        <p>
<bold>Historical Perspective</bold>
</p>
        <p>Early in the 1900s, there were considerable efforts by neurologists to understand unusual forms of body perception reported by patients with brain injury, or phantom limb experience in amputees. The early concepts of body image indeed were rooted in neuropathology. Head, in 1920, first defined body image as a unity of past experiences created in the cerebral sensory cortex. Schilder, who was a neurologist, proposed a biopsychosocial approach to body image, highlighting the need to examine its neurological, psychological, and sociocultural components. Newell noted that body image is dynamic and changes with age, mood, or even clothing. Krueger suggested that body image is the representation of identity derived from both external and internal body experiences.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Definition</bold>
</p>
        <p>What is body image, and why is it important?</p>
        <p>Body image is one of the components of personal identity. Body image is the figure that one has on their anthropometric measurements, contours, and shape of the body; and also the feelings correlated to these factors that affect the satisfaction with the body or specific parts of the body.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Indeed, body image represents how we think, feel, perceive, and behave regarding our bodies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>Body image is a multidimensional concept. The complexity of body image can be appreciated by looking at its components. These components apply to people with healthy and unhealthy perceptions of their bodies and include:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Cognitive: thoughts and beliefs about the body</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Perceptual: how people perceive the size and shape of their body and body parts</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Affective: feelings about the body</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Behavioral: the actions that people perform to check on, tend to, alter, or conceal their body<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r9">[9]</xref></p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>Related but different terms are often used interchangeably in the literature concerning the state of consciousness in which there is an altered body image perception, including body image distortion, body image misperception, body image disturbance, negative body image, altered body image, and body dissatisfaction. The problem of variable terms is intensified by the fact that some studies focus on psychiatric or medical patients, some deal with nonpatients, and others deal with both groups.</p>
        <p>Body image distortion is a multidimensional symptom, comprising various components of body image. Components that most widely accepted are the cognitive, the perceptive, and the affective.&#x000a0;The cognitive component is from thoughts and beliefs concerning body shape and appearance, and the mental representation of the body. The perceptive component involves the identification and estimation of the body, and it indicates the accuracy of the individuals' evaluation of their body size, shape, and weight compared to their actual proportions. Finally, the affective component includes feelings that individuals develop towards their body and satisfaction or dissatisfaction of individuals about their body.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>Thereupon, body image disturbance can manifest as disturbance of percept (i.e., distortion) and concept (i.e., body dissatisfaction). Perceptual disturbance involves the failure to evaluate the size of one&#x02019;s body accurately. Body dissatisfaction includes attitudinal or affective perception of one&#x02019;s body and negative feelings and cognitions. Body image disturbances are thought to also manifest on a behavioral level, such as body avoidance, body checking, or dieting.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r10">[10]</xref></p>
        <p>Negative body image characteristically demonstrates a dissatisfaction of body or body parts, preoccupation with appearance, and engaging in behaviors such as frequent mirror checking, self-weighing, or avoidance of public situations. Negative body image often gets measured as body dissatisfaction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Body dissatisfaction is attributable to a discrepancy between the perception of body image and its idealized image.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Body Image Development </bold>
</p>
        <p>There are some debates as to when body image development begins.</p>
        <p>Price believes that primitive sense of body image originates in the uterus with spontaneous movements of the fetus and corresponding feedback from sensory and proprioceptive input. Body image is a learned phenomenon from experiences during both pre-natal and post-natal development in which cross-cortical connections and mirror neurons play prominent roles.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r11">[11]</xref> Complex interactions between neurophysiological, socio-cultural, and cognitive factors contribute to body image development and maintenance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r6">[6]</xref> Different factors such as gender, fashion, peer groups, educational and familial influences, evolving socialization, and physical alterations (hair growth, acne, breast development, menstruation) put children into unknown territory with vulnerable body images.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>Primary socialization takes place early in life, and a sense of self-recognition is assumed to develop by the age of two. Children in the toddler years become aware of their gender. They also discover social norms, such as competitiveness and athleticism for men (strong legs, muscles, large arms), and beauty or smallness for females (glossy hair, perfect skin, tiny waist, no hips). When children become aware of their body appearance, they attempt to manipulate their parents to receive admiration and approval. This need for approval grows upon starting school, exhibiting a need for social acceptance. Cash assumes body image as a learned behavior. Smolak proposes that children mainly focus on appearance in the context of the toys they play with, such as Barbie dolls. As children grow and socialize, they begin comparing themselves with other children, especially concerning appearance (e.g., little children desire to be bigger). By the age of 6, body shape becomes increasingly prominent consideration (especially muscle and weight). Smolak reported that among school children aged 6 to 12 years old, 40&#x02013;50% demonstrated dissatisfaction with some part of their body size or shape.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>Adolescence indicates the transition from childhood to adulthood and is associated with physical and social changes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r7">[7]</xref> Adolescence is a critical period in body image development. Body image in adolescents is also under the influence of parents. The parent-adolescent relationship has a significant impact on the development of adolescents&#x02019; body dissatisfaction. Parents send sociocultural or critical messages and messages about body appearance ideals to their children. When Individuals feel secure regarding their relationships, they are more satisfied with their body and less likely to think in ways that they have to adhere to appearance ideals to receive others&#x02019; acceptance. Researches have shown that adolescents with better parent-adolescent relationships are less likely to experience body dissatisfaction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;Although in younger children, the influence of families on body image development is more significant than friends, the role of parents decreases as children get older and peer responses become more important than families. Body image in people aged 14 to 27 is greatly affected by their peers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r7">[7]</xref> A critical event or series of events such as teasing and rejection may lead to body image misperception. Studies have found that the more frequent being teased about body size and weight while growing up, the more likely to experience body image distortion and body dissatisfaction during adulthood.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r13">[13]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-18424.s2" sec-type="Etiology">
        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>Body image distortion is central to several serious diseases, including eating disorders and body dysmorphic disorder. Although the former assumption was that body image in healthy individuals is highly accurate, recent researches have shown that systematic distortions of body representation are also a normal part of healthy cognitive life. These distortions in healthy people might indicate weak forms of body image distortions seen in various diseases. Understanding of these neurotypical distortions may help to understand the perceptual distortions in clinical settings.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>Body image is the term that predominantly implies a visual representation of body shape and size, similar to a 2D photograph that shows what we look like as a physical object and how other people see us from the outside. However, besides our ability to assess the body as if viewed from the outside, we are also able to perceive it from the inside. This internal way of body image perception is obviously unavailable for other physical objects, and it provides us with additional sources of information, including touch, proprioception, and interoception. While most of both behavioral and functional neuroimaging studies have primarily concentrated on body misperception/dissatisfaction as a unisensory concept related to the visual domain, new studies have pointed that the combination of the visual and somatosensory body representations affect the perceptual assessment of body image.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r4">[4]</xref> Research has found that basic interoceptive processes (the sensations generated by internal organs) and interoceptive awareness may significantly contribute to the formation of body image.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r14">[14]</xref> Furthermore, different manifestations of body image distortion are observable in patients with anorexia nervosa including reduced interoceptive awareness, overestimation of tactile stimuli; abnormal body scaled action, disturbed haptic perception, and altered integration of proprioceptive and visual information.&#x000a0;In general, body image perception is a multisensory concept that includes different inputs such as visual, tactile, proprioceptive, and interoceptive. Hence, the perception of one's own body is due to co-perception and combination of the different sensory information. In general, body image perception is a multisensory concept that includes different inputs such as visual, tactile, proprioceptive, and interoceptive. Hence, the perception of one's own body is due to co-perception and combination of the different sensory information.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r14">[14]</xref></p>
        <p>Additionally, biased information processing may contribute to the misperception of body size and shape. Memory biases, attentional biases, and interpretation biases are different kinds of cognitive biases that have been found to be partly responsible for the distorted body image in individuals with eating disorders.</p>
        <p>Memory biases refer to the facilitated/impaired encoding and remembering of disorder salient information such as words or sentences related to weight and shape, compared to neutral information.</p>
        <p>Attentional biases include three components of attention:</p>
        <p>1-Facilitated attentional capture: disorder salient information is detected faster than non-salient information.</p>
        <p>2- Difficulty in disengagement: disorder salient information is more difficult to disengage, e.g., stronger attention towards unattractive parts of one&#x02019;s own body compared to attractive parts.</p>
        <p>3- Attentional avoidance: keeping attention away from disorder salient information.</p>
        <p>Interpretation biases refer to the biased information-processing and tendency to inappropriately analyze ambiguous information, e.g., everyday scenarios, according to disorder-specific cognitive schemata.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r10">[10]</xref></p>
        <p>One particularly interesting point is that recent studies have found links between body image distortions in healthy individuals and homuncular distortions in primary somatosensory cortex (SI). Research has shown that healthy individuals tend to overestimate their body part in length while underestimating them in volume. This pattern of body representation shows some resemblance to a well-known depiction of a somatosensory homunculus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>Moreover, body dissatisfaction and body image distortions in patients with anorexia nervosa appear to have links to the parietal lobe function. Neuroimaging studies have found sub-optimal visual and tactile performance in anorexia nervosa that suggests indirect associations of body image distortion with parietal lobe dysfunction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r4">[4]</xref></p>

<bold>Factors Affecting Body Image and Body Image Disorders</bold>
</p>
        <p>To date, various factors that influence body image have been studied such as BMI, family, peers, society, media, culture, self-esteem, psychopathology, gender, age, marital status, education level, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, weight control behavior, religiosity, and spirituality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r15">[15]</xref> Since body dissatisfaction is detrimental to wellbeing, it is essential to identify its correlates.</p>

        </list>
        <p>One of the most important factors influencing body image and body satisfaction is BMI, a continuous variable using the standard formula of kilograms over height squared.&#x000a0;As a biological component, BMI has been found to contribute to body image and fear of negative evaluation (fear that one will be evaluated unfavorably because of one&#x02019;s appearance). Overweight individuals are more likely to report the sense of fear associated with being negatively evaluated while engaging in social situations compare to their normal-weight counterparts. They also tend to show negative affective attitudes toward their body.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r16">[16]</xref> Body image discordance is the discrepancy between body image and BMI and defined as perceived body size minus actual body size. Underestimation is perceiving the body as smaller than the actual BMI, and overestimation is perceiving the body as larger than the actual BMI. body image discordance is associated with body image dissatisfaction and negatively impacts mental health, including lowering self-esteem and increasing depression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r15">[15]</xref></p>

        <p>Family plays an important role in the development of children&#x02019;s body image, body size attitudes, and eating patterns, as they form in early childhood.&#x000a0;Family is a prominent and continuing influence, as children develop the need for parental admiration and approval. Parents may increase or decrease the risk of the development of body image and eating concerns in their children, directly or indirectly. Parents with particular attention toward weight control behaviors have significant influences on children&#x02019;s body satisfaction. Direct parental attitudes can include commenting to a child about their weight or appearance, teasing about a child&#x02019;s weight, pressuring a child to lose weight, or encouraging a child to diet. Indirect parental behaviors are actions or attitudes that are not necessarily planned to influence the child, including parents&#x02019; negative comments about their bodies and parental engagement in excessive exercise or dieting. These behaviors may model self-criticism and inspire children to judge themselves or others based on appearance and highlight the importance of adhering to social and cultural body size ideals. Some other family features may also contribute to body satisfaction, such as the socioeconomic status of the family and living in large cities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r17">[17]</xref></p>

        <p>Although body image is a mental concept, it is observable as a social phenomenon. Both women and men attempt to present and maintain themselves in socially desirable body shape. Social acceptance is a critical component of the lifecycle and is central to well being. In response to the need for social acceptance, individuals develop behavioral responses that enhance their social desirability. Through the social learning process, individuals observe, imitate, and reinforce their behavior to increase the likelihood of social acceptance; this is particularly important in adolescents for attaining acceptance in peer groups.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r15">[15]</xref> Weight-related bullying during adolescence significantly contributes to the development of negative body perceptions and body dissatisfaction.

Newer forms of media (e.g., internet, social media, computer games) is being more popular than traditional forms (e.g., printed materials and TV) as time goes on.&#x000a0;Several studies suggest a link between the muscular male body ideal and the thin female beauty ideal represented in the media with a variety of psychological conditions including body image misperception, body dissatisfaction, and eating disorders.&#x000a0;This link has been explained mostly by sociocognitive processes such as social comparison.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r19">[19]</xref></p>

        <p>Social media is a more recent form of media that has become increasingly popular worldwide, and nowadays, messages regarding appearance ideals delivered through social media. Due to its continuous availability (e.g., on smartphones), the influences of social media may be more potent than traditional forms of media. Several studies have suggested that active social media engagement may negatively influence body image and appears to be associated with body dissatisfaction and eating disorders. Different theoretical mechanisms have been proposed, such as body appearance comparisons and self-objectification.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r20">[20]</xref>&#x000a0;On social media, users post their photographs and view photos of others, and physical appearance is an important factor in these activities. In addition to receiving messages and comments about their bodies on social media, users see carefully edited and selected social media imagery including depictions of thin bodies (thinspiration) or lean and muscular bodies (fitspiration). Users might frequently compare themselves with appearance ideals that conveyed to them through social media and internalize these ideals as the standards for their own body. When their physical appearance is not a match for the internalized ideals, this may result in body dissatisfaction.&#x000a0;This concept is particularly important in adolescents who spend more time and receive more feedback about their appearance on social media.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r21">[21]</xref></p>

        <p>Body image is highly related to an individual&#x02019;s self-esteem and self-concept. Self-esteem can be a potential factor reducing the adverse association of BMI, body image, and fear of negative evaluation. Higher self-esteem may serve as a protective factor, decreasing the negative association between BMI and feelings of individuals about their body, also reducing the level of anxiety caused by others&#x02019; unfavorable judgments.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r16">[16]</xref> Furthermore, Body dissatisfaction is negatively associated with self-esteem and is a strong predictor of self-esteem reduction,&#x000a0;particularly in adolescents.&#x000a0;This association is not equal for all adolescents, and it may be more influential in racial, ethnic, or gender groups that pay more attention to appearance and body shape.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r22">[22]</xref></p>

<bold>Eating Disorders</bold>
</p>
        <p>Patients with eating disorders are often afraid to be judged or criticized. These fears are more notable as it reports repeatedly show that attitudes of health professionals towards eating disorders patients are not always positive. Training and support strategies may minimize these effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r28">[28]</xref> Clinicians have access to numerous standardized self-report measures and interview-based measures. There have always been debates about the superiority of clinical interviews as opposed to self-report measures; however, the choice depends on the purpose and context of assessment, time limitations, and availability of training and clinical factors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r29">[29]</xref></p>
        <p>Administration&#x000a0;of&#x000a0;standardized self-report questionnaires is quick and easy. In primary care situations, where an eating disorder is suspected, shorter measures such as the Eating Attitudes Test and SCOFF are more useful.&#x000a0;Longer self-report measures such as Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI-3) are more useful in specialist settings to collect precise information about the severity and the extent of psychopathology. Clinical interviews are more time-consuming, require training, are often considered as gold standards, and are more likely useful for research purposes compared to clinical settings.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r29">[29]</xref></p>

            <p>Do these appearance concerns interfere with your life or cause difficulties for you in any way?</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>It is essential to ask precisely what body areas the patient is concerned with and what body area is the most pressing concern, instead of assuming which ones they are. This approach is particularly important because some patients may have actual appearance flaws without significant concern and suggesting that these areas appear defective can undermine the therapeutic relationship and upset the patient. Moreover, some patients are too embarrassed to share all of their appearance concerns. These patients require to meet with the clinician numerous times to feel more comfortable. Patients who are depressed, socially anxious or anxious, housebound, abusing substances, or suicidal should have screening for BDD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r30">[30]</xref></p>
        <p>When interviewing a patient to diagnose BDD, the clinician&#x02019;s attitude is very important. Questions about appearance concerns need to be in a rational and empathic way. All concerns need to be taken seriously and not considered vanity. Many of these patients are rejection sensitive and unwilling to reveal their concerns since they are fearful that they others will see them as superficial or vain. BDD is a serious disease, and these patients suffer tremendously and can be highly suicidal.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r30">[30]</xref></p>
        <p>When attempting to diagnose BDD, it is easy to make mistakes and miss the diagnosis. It is recommended to avoid certain types of questions. A clinician should avoid asking if the patient is concerned with an imagined defect. The word &#x0201c;imagined&#x0201d; is problematic based on the fact that most BDD patients tend to have poor insight and consider their problem to be real. Another question to avoid is asking if the patient believes he or she is disfigured or deformed. Instead, the clinician can guide the patient by asking, &#x0201c;What words do you use to describe your appearance? Some people would say they look ugly, unattractive, or even deformed. Do any of these words describe how you see yourself?&#x0201d; Also, a clinician should not ask if patients think there is something wrong with their body. This question is general, and it is better to ask precisely about appearance concerns.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r30">[30]</xref></p>
        <p>Although by definition, the appearance defects are minimal or nonexistent, the patient&#x02019;s appearance can provide clues to the presence of BDD. For instance:<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r30">[30]</xref></p>

</p>
        <p>Assessment of the attitudinal component of body image has been&#x000a0;more&#x000a0;straight-forward than the perceptual component. Body dissatisfaction is the most frequently measured attitudinal component of body image. Commonly, psychometric&#x000a0;tools are used to evaluate body dissatisfaction.&#x000a0;Although a variety of techniques are available for the assessment of body dissatisfaction, figure rating scales have been the most commonly used tool. This type of scale typically includes a set of figures that vary in body size from being very underweight to very overweight. Participants are asked to choose a figure that represents their perceived actual body size, and also the figure that they would like to be (i.e., the ideal body size). The discrepancy between an individual&#x02019;s perceptual and ideal body image represents body dissatisfaction.

Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT) or Cognitive Enhancement Therapy is a group of interventions that are designed to enhance an individual&#x02019;s neurocognitive abilities such as cognitive flexibility and planning, attention, working memory, set-shifting, and executive functioning. CRT can identify and target the cognitive impairments specific to an individual.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r31">[31]</xref></p>

<bold>Pharmacotherapy in Body Dysmorphic Disorder</bold>
</p>
        <p>Current clinical guidelines indicate that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) plus serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are the first-line treatments for body dysmorphic disorder. Appropriate pharmacotherapy improves core BDD symptoms, suicidality, and psychosocial functioning in a majority of patients. The patient&#x02019;s willingness to accept and adhere to pharmacotherapy requires identification since many patients have poor insight and may desire cosmetic treatment instead of pharmacotherapy. The doses of SRI medication necessary to treat BDD are often higher than doses needed to address other common psychiatric disorders, and patients should remain on the medication for relatively long periods.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r32">[32]</xref></p>

<bold>Pharmacotherapy in Eating Disorders</bold>
</p>
        <p>Several drugs have been targets of study in anorexia nervosa treatment, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antidepressants, antipsychotics, nutritional supplementation, and hormonal medications. There is limited evidence supporting pharmacotherapy in anorexia nervosa, and many patients do not respond to the available treatments. In general, drugs are useful for patients with bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED). Antidepressants are the primary pharmacotherapy in bulimia nervosa.&#x000a0;For binge eating disorder, Lisdexamphetamin is the first medication to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of binge eating disorder.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r33">[33]</xref></p>

<bold>Normal Appearance Concern</bold>
</p>
        <p>Body image falls on a continuum from healthy body perceptions to unhealthy body perceptions. Accordingly, body dysmorphic disorder concerns may be on a spectrum with normal appearance concerns, contrasting only quantitatively.&#x000a0;Appearance concerns are increasingly common. Ongoing studies in the United States indicate that the number of people who experience dissatisfaction with some aspect of their physical appearance is progressively increasing. At the same time, an increasing interest exists for cosmetic specialists and procedures to enhance physical appearance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r34">[34]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Dysmorphic Concern</bold>
</p>
        <p>Dysmorphic concern is attributable to an excessive concern and preoccupation with a perceived or slight defect in the body, also includes concerns about body odor or function and non-appearance related somatic concerns. Dysmorphic concerns also lie on a continuum of severity from no or minimal concerns to severe concerns. Dysmorphic concern is not a DSM diagnosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r35">[35]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Disordered Eating</bold>
</p>
        <p>The definition of disordered eating attitudes is any abnormal thoughts, beliefs, affects, and behaviors towards food, and are associated with body image misperception, body dissatisfaction, and unhealthy weight control beliefs and practice. It is important to note that eating problems exist on a spectrum from disordered eating that does not meet the DSM criteria to anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Disordered eating is a risk factor for the development of full-syndrome eating disorders, and thus, early detection to provide appropriate intervention is particularly important.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r36">[36]</xref></p>

<bold>Anorexia Nervosa (AN)</bold>
</p>
        <p>Eating disorders (ED) are among the most severe manifestations of body image dysfunction. Traditionally, treatment of eating disorders involves the treatment of body image disturbances. Body image distortion is a core characteristic of anorexia nervosa (AN), and this distortion exists in both attitudinal and perceptual level.&#x000a0;Anorexia nervosa is the restriction of energy intake, body image distortion and misperception of body weight, fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, and significantly low BMI. In the DSM-5, the amenorrhea criterion no longer applies for anorexia nervosa.&#x000a0;AN has a prevalence of 0.4% and is considered to be one of the most challenging psychiatric disorders to treat with the highest mortality rates in mental disorders.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r37">[37]</xref></p>

<bold>Bulimia Nervosa (BN)</bold>
</p>
        <p>Bulimia nervosa (BN) is a potentially life-threatening and debilitating eating disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of overeating (bingeing) followed by inappropriate compensatory behaviors (purging) such as self-induced vomiting, misusing of laxatives or diuretics, and excessive exercise, to compensate for the excessive caloric intake. Body image distortion often accompanies bulimia nervosa and excessive concern about body weight and shape. Indeed, Self-evaluation and self-worth in these individuals suffer undue influence from body shape and weight. BN has a chronic or intermittent course and often persists for several years after onset.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r38">[38]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r39">[39]</xref></p>

<bold>Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD)</bold>
</p>
        <p>The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental disorders-5 (DSM-5) characterizes body dysmorphic disorder as a distressing preoccupation or a markedly excessive concern with one or more perceived or slight defects in physical appearance, associated with significant distress and functional impairment. The criteria also specify that at some point during the illness, individuals perform repetitive and compulsive behaviors in response to their appearance concerns. These irresistible and distressful compulsions can be behavioral (e.g., mirror checking, excessive grooming, camouflaging, skin picking, reassurance seeking) or mental acts (e.g., comparing the disliked appearance features to those of other people).&#x000a0;A majority of patients exhibit excessive self-consciousness, often with ideas or delusions of reference, which are irrational beliefs that random incidents in the world relate directly to them. For instance, thinking that others are taking special notice of, talking about, judging, or mocking them because of the perceived defect or flaw.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r40">[40]</xref>&#x000a0;As in anorexia and bulimia nervosa, body image disturbances precede the disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r23">[23]</xref>&#x000a0;It is important to note that, if an eating disorder explains all patient&#x02019;s appearance concerns, an eating disorder is a more appropriate diagnosis than BDD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r30">[30]</xref></p>
        <p>BDD is associated with significant psychosocial impairment and high rates of depression, suicidality, and hospitalization. Estimates of the prevalence of BDD in the general population are between 0.7% and 3.2%.&#x000a0;BDD is frequently found in clinical settings, with prevalence of 13% to 16% in psychiatric inpatients, 4.8% in adolescent inpatients, 9% to 12% in dermatology settings, 8% to 37% in individuals with OCD, 3% to 53% in cosmetic surgery settings, 11% to 13% in social phobia, and 14% to 42% in atypical major depressive disorder.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r41">[41]</xref></p>

<bold>Muscle Dysmorphia (MD)</bold>
</p>
        <p>Muscle dysmorphia is a rare form of body dysmorphic disorder that is focused on muscularity and mostly found in men. It refers to an extreme desire to gain lean muscle mass and preoccupation with a perceived lack of muscularity. Although muscle dysmorphia is included in DSM-5 as a variant of body dysmorphic disorder, similarities with eating disorders, particularly anorexia nervosa, have been postulated. Researchers have proposed that MD is a reverse form of anorexia nervosa and even the word &#x0201c;bigorexia&#x0201d; has been coined to explain it. Individuals with MD may experience impairment in social and occupational functioning because of embarrassment over their perceived appearance flaws and consequently, their tendency for social withdrawal; also because of their need to follow a careful diet and time-consuming workout schedule. They may also damage their health by risky body change behaviors, excessively working out, and use of anabolic-androgenic steroids.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r42">[42]</xref></p>

<bold>Binge Eating Disorder (BED)</bold>
</p>
        <p>&#x000a0;DSM-5 characterizes binge eating disorder as recurrent episodes of consuming large amounts of food (i.e., binge eating), quickly and until feeling uncomfortably full. Additional criteria include eating alone, eating without being hungry, feeling guilty, disgusted, or depressed after overeating, marked distress regarding binge eating, and absence of regular compensatory behaviors such as purging. Although the criteria for BED do not include a body image related criterion, new evidence show that body image disturbance might play roles in BED and could be a target for treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r10">[10]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Obsessive-compulsive Disorder (OCD)</bold>
</p>
        <p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a disabling condition characterized by obsessions and compulsions. Recent studies have shown that OCD may be associated with different aspects of body image.&#x000a0;In addition to OCD, several other disorders have key obsessive and compulsive characteristics. In BDD, the obsessive thoughts direct on their perceived defect and how they can resolve the physical problem. Further, the compulsive behaviors include checking their appearance, temporary solutions such as camouflaging, or the search for permanent solutions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r43">[43]</xref></p>

<bold>Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)</bold>
</p>
        <p>Recent studies have suggested that social anxiety disorder may be associated with body image-related dysfunction. Social anxiety disorder and BDD are two different but conceptually overlapping disorders.

        <p>The accessibility and enthusiasm of adolescent students to engage in educational activities make the school environment an appropriate place to implement health promotion programs. Several studies have suggested school-based educational programs to improve body image and to help prevent eating disorders. School curricula include different mandatory health topics such as lifestyle and personal development problems. Few major school-based interventions to prevent eating disorders and improve the body image have been the object of study to date that all employ a similar information-based strategy. These interventions focus on providing information about eating disorders and body image-related issues to female secondary school students in a traditional structured classroom setting. Topics include sociocultural development of body image and body image ideals, healthy eating, the potential risks of caloric restriction, and expectations about the perfect body is covered. The results of these interventions have suggested that although this approach is likely to improve the knowledge of eating disorders and disordered eating, it is unlikely to influence the thoughts, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that affect the development of eating disorders. Research frequently shows that the information-giving approach to educate body image is fundamentally flawed and is ineffective in improving body image and eating behaviors in adolescent females.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r48">[48]</xref></p>

Although each member of the team has unique responsibilities and skills concerning patient care, there is substantial overlap in the responsibilities of the treatment team to help recovery from disordered eating.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r49">[49]</xref> Education of the patient and their family is critical to prevent the high morbidity. The dietitian should educate the patient and family on the nutritional significance and limiting exercises. The pharmacist should inform patients and their family on medication abuse such as laxatives or weight loss medications. This portion of the care can benefit from input and collaboration with a pharmacist, who can also monitor for drug interactions in the patient's regimen. The outcomes can improve only through monitoring and close follow up of the patient. Nurses can influence the quality of care by managing the complexity in their relationships with these patients. The mental health nurse can educate the patient on easing stress, overcoming emotional issues, and changes in behavior. Even with an interprofessional treatment approach, the overall prognosis is poor, and all clinicians must consider early comprehensive intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r50">[50]</xref> [Level III]</p>
        <p>Individuals with BDD are generally secretive about their symptoms. Healthcare professionals may indeed stigmatize these patients by considering only an actual disfigurement as worthy of medical attention. Hence, patients with BDD are more likely to present to healthcare professionals with complaints such as social anxiety or depression since these are less stigmatizing. Healthcare professionals should provide accurate information to patients and their families and help them to understand their symptoms are involuntary.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r51">[51]</xref> [Level I]</p>
        <p>PCPs and other nonpsychiatric physicians may tend to refer the patient to another nonpsychiatrist or even a cosmetic specialist; however, this is unlikely to be helpful.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r30">[30]</xref>&#x000a0;BDD patients and their mental health providers need to be aware that non-mental health interventions appear unlikely to treat BDD symptoms successfully.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r41">[41]</xref> The clinicians can inform the patient that he or she can receive cosmetic treatment if they want, although the clinician can not recommend a cosmetic solution. It is also helpful to acknowledge to the patient that the clinician worries the patient will be unhappy with the outcome of cosmetic treatment. The patient needs to be encouraged to seek appropriate psychiatric treatment to decrease distress and live a more productive life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r30">[30]</xref>&#x000a0;Dermatologists and surgeons should screen patients for BDD and accurately diagnose this disease since available psychiatric treatments are up-and-coming for patients with this distressing disorder.&#x000a0;Mental health professionals specialized in BDD should work in partnership with dermatologists and cosmetic surgeons to ensure that a validated screening system and agreed referral criteria are in place. They also should provide training opportunities for dermatologists and cosmetic surgeons to help in recognition of BDD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18424.r51">[51]</xref> [Level I] Specialty trained nurses in eating disorders and psychiatry monitor patients, coordinate between other providers and provide feedback to the team.

        <p>Body image distortion and its accompanying disorders is a complex clinical scenario and require an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results.
