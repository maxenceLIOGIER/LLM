        <p>Since their discovery, corticosteroids have been used in almost all areas of medicine and by nearly every route.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20045.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Corticosteroids are synthetic analogs of the natural steroid hormones produced by the adrenal cortex and include glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. The synthetic hormones have varying degrees of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid properties. Glucocorticoids are predominantly involved in metabolism and have immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, and vasoconstrictive effects. While mineralocorticoids regulate electrolytes and water balance by affecting ion transport in the epithelial cells of the renal tubules.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20045.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>The term corticosteroids in practice, however, is generally used to refer to the glucocorticoid effect. Glucocorticoids are primary stress hormones that regulate a variety of physiologic processes and are essential for life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20045.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Corticosteroids are among the most widely prescribed drug classes worldwide, with an estimated market of more than 10 billion USD per year.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20045.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;An estimated one percent of the total adult population in the United Kingdom receives oral glucocorticoids at any one time.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20045.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Indications for corticosteroid therapy include hundreds of conditions. These indications can very generally group into infectious and inflammatory disorders, allergic and autoimmune diseases, shock, lowering of hypercalcemia, promotion of water excretion, treatment of pathologic hypoglycemia, suppression of excess adrenocortical secretion, prevention of graft rejection, neurological disorders, hematologic disorders, skin disorders, and corticosteroid replacement therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20045.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20045.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>They have both endocrine and nonendocrine indications. Their endocrine role is often in the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome or the management of adrenal insufficiency and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Their nonendocrine role regularly takes advantage of their potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects to treat patients with a wide range of immunologic and inflammatory disorders.&#x000a0; Corticosteroids are used at physiologic doses as replacement therapy in cases of adrenal insufficiency and supraphysiologic doses in treatments for anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20045.r2">[2]</xref></p>

        <p>Corticosteroids produce their effect through multiple pathways.

        <title>Administration</title>
        <p>The route of administration for corticosteroids depends on many factors, primarily being the disorder treated. The route can be parenteral, oral, inhaled, topical, injected (intramuscular, intraarticular, intralesional, intradermal, etc.), and rectal.

        <p>Parenteral administration is often used in more emergent therapy as well as in those unable to tolerate medication by mouth. Oral administration is more common for chronic treatment. Patients should receive non-systemic therapy whenever possible to minimize systemic exposure.</p>

        <p>Clinicians should consider bone mineral density (BMD) testing at baseline and after one year of corticosteroid therapy along with height measurement and screening for any fragility fractures. Subsequent assessments can then be pushed out to every 2 to 3 years if stable at one year.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20045.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;If the patient shows decreased BMD, consider pharmacologic therapy, and the recommendation is to use that the World Health Organization&#x02019;s Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) to determine patients who will benefit from pharmacologic treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20045.r20">[20]</xref>&#x000a0;In children, the BMD assessment should take place serially, and referral to a pediatric bone health specialist may be in order if there is evidence of fragility or decline in BMD score.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20045.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Additionally, given the risk of osteonecrosis, evaluation for joint pain and reduced range of motion should be done at every visit. Adults should engage in preventive measures, including smoking cessation, reduced alcohol consumption, regular weight-bearing exercise, calcium, and supplement with vitamin D supplementation to reduce the risk of side effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20045.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>The healthcare team should be aware of the possibility of adrenal suppression in all patients on corticosteroids, particularly those on supraphysiologic doses, for more than two&#x000a0;weeks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20045.r21">[21]</xref>&#x000a0;If suspected, clinicians should obtain biochemical testing of the HPA axis with a first-morning cortisol measurement. If the morning cortisol level is in the normal range, but adrenal suppression is still suspected, consider a low-dose adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test. If adrenal suppression is confirmed, it should be treated with daily physiologic dosing plus &#x0201c;stress doses&#x0201d; as needed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20045.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>Corticosteroid users on concurrent NSAID therapy or others at higher risk of ulcers or gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, including those with a history of ulcers or GI bleeding and those with severe comorbidities (e.g., advanced cancer), should receive proton pump inhibitor therapy. To help reduce the risk of striae, patients should follow a low-calorie diet. Additionally, some success has been noted with topical vitamin A cream, pulsed dye lasers, and a non-ablative radiofrequency device.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20045.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>Corticosteroids have varying degrees of mineralocorticoid activity. The corticosteroids with higher levels of mineralocorticoid activity may lead to free water and salt retention in addition to potassium excretion. Thus, fluid and electrolyte levels should be monitored in patients on corticosteroids with higher mineralocorticoid activity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20045.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>Significant interactions between corticosteroids and other drugs also exist, so concurrent use of other medications should undergo an evaluation as changes in their management may be warranted. The effect of anticoagulants, such as warfarin, may increase, which would require closer monitoring and potential dosage change. This effect would likely be at 3 to 7 days after starting the corticosteroid.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20045.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Antihyperglycemic drugs may show less efficacy as glucocorticoids may counteract their effect; this would require an increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring and possible adjustment of the antihyperglycemic medications. Corticosteroid effect may be reduced by some antivirals (e.g., efavirenz, nevirapine) and increased by others (e.g., atazanavir, indinavir, ritonavir), so closer monitoring for corticosteroid effect and toxicity is a recommendation during concurrent use.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20045.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Concomitant corticosteroid and NSAID use can increase the risk of peptic ulcer disease. Thus avoidance of concomitant use should be considered if possible, and patients should start antacid therapy with a PPI. Live vaccine administration while a patient is taking immunosuppressive dosing of a glucocorticoid (40 mg/day of prednisolone or equivalent and greater for more than 7-day duration) may lead to an increased risk of infection. Therefore, the recommendation is to delay any live or live-attenuated vaccination for three months after discontinuing immunosuppressive glucocorticoid therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20045.r2">[2]</xref></p>

        <title>Toxicity</title>
        <p>The toxicity of corticosteroids accounts for one of the most common causes of iatrogenic illness in patients on chronic therapy.&#x000a0; No specific reversal agent exists for corticosteroids. Their effect in excess is manageable by gradual taper and addressing the particular complication (e.g., hyperglycemia, infection, hypertension). If steroid therapy is in place for less than one week, patients can usually stop without tapering. For dosing lasting one to three weeks, tapering should depend on the clinical conditions for which the patient took the medication. Rapid and complete withdrawal can lead to adrenocorticotropic hormone suppression and flare of the underlying disease. Courses&#x000a0;over three weeks&#x000a0;should have a quick taper to physiologic doses, then slow weaning should follow while evaluating the adrenal function. Long-term, high-dose suppressive therapy can lead to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis for as long as nine to twelve months following withdrawal.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20045.r2">[2]</xref></p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>Corticosteroids are widely used medications due to their benefit. However, they have many adverse effects. Their widespread use and many adverse effects place significant importance on their understanding by all healthcare team members. Their effects that are therapeutic in one patient may be detrimental in another. For example, their glucose-raising effect may be helpful in a patient with adrenal insufficiency but harmful in a patient with latent diabetes mellitus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-20045.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Careful patient monitoring and the use of proper preventive measures can reduce the adverse effects of corticosteroids and allow their maximal benefit.</p>
        <p>All interprofessional healthcare team members should be ready to educate their patients on corticosteroids and their potential adverse effects, and the modifications that can reduce these harmful effects. This team includes clinicians, mid-level practitioners, nursing staff, and pharmacists, all working collaboratively with open communication to ensure optimal treatment outcomes with minimal adverse events. All patients on any form of chronic systemic corticosteroid therapy should be identified and advised to carry a treatment card or other signifier&#x000a0;that they're on steroid therapy. In this era of electronic medical records, a tag may be applied to patients' charts to specifically notify other healthcare team members about the patient corticosteroid use. Many patient deaths and much morbidity are preventable through proper patient education and communication within the interprofessional team. [Level 5]</p>
