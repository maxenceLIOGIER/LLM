        <p>Bowenoid papulosis is a sexually transmitted condition associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, characterized by multiple well-demarcated, red-brown to violaceous papules in the genital area. This condition affects all sexes and is considered a premalignant condition, with the potential for progression to squamous cell carcinoma if left untreated. The primary goal of treatment is to prevent malignant transformation while preserving normal tissue and function. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, histopathology, and HPV testing, with management options ranging from topical treatments to surgical interventions.</p>
        <p>Participants in this course will gain a comprehensive understanding of Bowenoid papulosis, including its pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment protocols. Emphasis is placed on the importance of patient education, particularly regarding safe sexual practices to reduce the risk of HPV transmission. Collaboration with an interprofessional team, including dermatologists, gynecologists, urologists, and primary care clinicians, enhances patient outcomes by ensuring a holistic approach to care. Through coordinated efforts, the team can address the condition effectively, promote prevention strategies, and improve long-term health outcomes for patients.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Bowenoid papulosis is an uncommon sexually transmitted condition that was first described in 1977 by Kopf and Bart as penile papules. However, this condition occurs in any sex and tends to affect young, sexually active people. This condition was also termed &#x0201c;vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia&#x0201d; in the vulva and termed penile intraepithelial neoplasia in the penis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18487.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The classification of this disease was confusing and included 3 clinical entities: bowenoid papulosis, Bowen disease, and erythroplasia of Queyrat. Now it is recommended that these 3 entities not be used to describe lesions in the anogenital area.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18487.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;&#x000a0;However, dermatologists still recognize Bowenoid papulosis as a distinct clinical variant. Bowenoid papulosis is induced virally by human papillomavirus (HPV) and presents as solitary or multiple skin-colored papules in the anogenital area. This condition can last from 2 weeks to several years. Clinically, bowenoid papulosis is assimilated to genital warts, while histologically, it has a close resemblance to squamous cell carcinoma in situ (Bowen disease). Treatment is generally conservative. Bowenoid papulosis lesions are generally considered benign with a spontaneous regress leaving no sequelae in immunocompetent persons, although a small number may transform into invasive squamous cell carcinoma (see <bold>Image.</bold> Bowenoid Papulosis).</p>

      <sec id="article-18487.s3" sec-type="Etiology">
        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>Bowenoid papulosis is a sexually transmitted condition associated with HPV infection. Most lesions are associated with oncogenic HPV types, mainly the HPV 16 genotype, but occasionally, HPV 18, 31, 33, 34, 35, 39, 42, 48, 51, 52, 53, and 54 are detected.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18487.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Bowenoid papulosis may also occur in immunocompromised individuals, such as organ transplant recipients. Smoking has recognition as a recurrence factor.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-18487.s4" sec-type="Epidemiology">
        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>Bowenoid papulosis occurs commonly in sexually active individuals and predominantly in their third to the mid-fifth decade with a mean age of 31 years. However,&#x000a0;bowenoid papulosis can appear at any age range from 3 to 80 years. All sexes are affected, although recent data showed an increased number of women. There are an estimated 5 cases per 100,000 women.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18487.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;The exact prevalence is unknown because&#x000a0;bowenoid papulosis lesions are related clinically to genital warts; there is no racial predilection for bowenoid papulosis.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-18487.s5" sec-type="Pathophysiology">
        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>Detection of papillomavirus common antigen in cases of&#x000a0;bowenoid papulosis supports the hypothesis that&#x000a0;bowenoid papulosis results from HPV. In fact, E6 and E7 viral oncoproteins of oncogenic HPV types contribute to oncogenesis by inducing over-expression of p16 protein and human telomerase reverse transcription.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-18487.s6" sec-type="Histopathology">
        <title>Histopathology</title>
        <p>Histologically,&#x000a0;bowenoid papulosis is characterized by acanthosis with full-thickness epidermal atypia, known as Bowenoid dysplasia. Multiple metaphase mitoses are usually visible above the basal layer and scattered dyskeratotic and multinucleated keratinocytes with pleiomorphism; histopathologic findings may also show parakeratosis and hypergranulosis. The integrity of the basement membrane is preserved, and the dermis contains a superficial infiltrate of lymphocytes with perivascular accentuation. Induction of the focal epidermal hyperplasia and dysplasia is viral. Moreover, immunohistochemistry for the p16 protein reveals strong in bowenoid papulosis. Staining with an antibody to p16 protein has high specificity and sensitivity to detect this disease.</p>

        <title>History and Physical</title>
        <p>Bowenoid papulosis is a rare transmitted condition and typically occurs in sexually active people. This condition is clinically characterized by multiple well-demarcated red-brown to violaceous papules, usually less than 1 cm in size. The surface of the lesion can be flat, smooth, papillomatous, or verrucous, and some papules may coalesce into large plaques. Sometimes,&#x000a0;bowenoid papulosis presents as warty white plaques. The distribution of lesions is commonly discrete; sometimes&#x000a0;bowenoid papulosis can have an annular or linear exhibition. In men,&#x000a0;bowenoid papulosis lesions primarily involve the penile shaft but may also involve the foreskin, glans, scrotum as well as the anus. Whereas in women, the lesions are usually bilateral and affect the labia major, labia minor, clitoris, inside the vagina, inguinal folds, and perianal area. The lesions are generally darker in women than in men. The lesions are usually asymptomatic; occasionally, patients may complain of pruritus and soreness of the affected area. Extragenital&#x000a0;bowenoid papulosis is a very rare condition, and it may involve the face, fingers, or neck, with or without concomitant genital lesions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18487.r4">[4]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-18487.s8" sec-type="Evaluation">
        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>Because of its potential malignant transformation, the diagnosis is usually by a skin biopsy. HPV subtyping may also be a recommended next step. Microscopic findings show typical features of Bowen disease with only a few differentiating features. The distinction rests in the circumscribed plaque-like pattern, the multiplicity of lesions, the age of the patient, and less dyskeratosis and atypia and more dilated vessels in the dermis in pathology.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18487.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;Hence the diagnosis of&#x000a0;bowenoid papulosis is based on clinical&#x000a0;grounds and histopathological correlation. Furthermore, a skin biopsy is recommended in case of recalcitrant lesions to standard therapies to rule out malignancy. An extensive assessment of HPV infection is mandatory, including examination of the oral, genital, and anal areas. Besides, anoscopy should be performed in the case of receptive anal sex. All this must be performed for the patient as well as the partner.</p>

      <sec id="article-18487.s9" sec-type="Treatment / Management">
        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>The treatment aims to prevent malignancy transformation&#x000a0;and to preserve normal tissue and function. Since the disease commonly occurs in young people and frequently remits spontaneously, the management of&#x000a0;bowenoid papulosis is generally conservative. Without treatment,&#x000a0;bowenoid papulosis lesions may regress in an average of 8 months. Treatment modalities include locally ablative or destructive therapies such as carbon dioxide laser vaporization, cryotherapy, electrocoagulation, 5-aminolevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic therapy, excisional surgery, and 5 fluorouracil. Moreover, topical imiquimod cream 5% once a day on an alternate day for&#x000a0;1 month has proven good results on limited lesions of&#x000a0;bowenoid papulosis with viral clearance in some cases. However, relapse often occurs with all treatment modalities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18487.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18487.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18487.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;Furthermore, there are prophylactic vaccines to prevent infection with oncologic HPV subtypes. Moreover, prevention of recurrence correlates with cessation of cigarette smoking.</p>

        <p>Transformation into invasive squamous cell carcinoma is rare and occurs in less than 1 % of cases, especially in immunocompromised individuals.

        <title>Deterrence and Patient Education</title>
        <p>Bowenoid papulosis&#x000a0;rarely evolves into invasive squamous cell carcinoma; however, it is essential to educate patients regarding the risk of potential malignant transformation. The patient should receive thorough education regarding HPV infections which spread via sexual contact. Therefore, the avoidance of direct sexual contact should be strongly advocated to decrease transmission of the disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-18487.r8">[8]</xref> Additionally, female partners of men should receive a close follow-up.</p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>The management of&#x000a0;bowenoid papulosis is best with an interprofessional approach, including a team of clinicians. Bowenoid papulosis may develop malignant characteristics; therefore, a long-term evaluation is recommended by a dermatologist every 3 to 6 months. Thus, the gynecologist should perform a careful cervical and anal cytologic screening of female patients as well as of sexual partners of the male patient. The urologist should examine patients with urethral involvement. Patients with perianal involvement should be examined by a GI specialist. Furthermore, smoking cessation is strongly advised.</p>
