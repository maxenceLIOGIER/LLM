        <p>Traumatic injuries in older adults, typically defined as individuals aged 65 and older, present unique challenges due to age-related physiological changes and preexisting medical conditions. As the population of older adults continues to grow, so does the incidence of traumatic injuries among this demographic. Older adults are at a higher risk of morbidity and mortality following trauma, as conditions like cognitive impairment, cardiovascular disease, and multiorgan insufficiency contribute to general frailty. These factors limit their ability to respond to injuries and increase the likelihood of complications and death compared to younger individuals. Additionally, the aging process often results in decreased bone density, reduced muscle mass, and slower healing, making even minor injuries potentially life-threatening. The presence of multiple comorbidities further complicates the management of trauma in this population, requiring a nuanced approach to care that addresses the acute injury and the underlying health conditions that may exacerbate outcomes.</p>
        <p>Participants in this educational activity gain a comprehensive understanding of the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of trauma in older adults, focusing on the unique physiological considerations and common types of trauma that affect this population. The activity emphasizes the importance of collaborating with an interprofessional healthcare team, which includes specialists in geriatrics, emergency medicine, surgery, and rehabilitation. By integrating expertise from various disciplines, the healthcare team can develop and implement tailored care strategies that address the complexities of aging, leading to improved recovery and quality of life for older trauma patients.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Assessing traumatic injuries in older adults requires a unique skill set. Many countries are seeing an increasing number of&#x000a0;individuals&#x000a0;aged 65 and older. For example, the United States Census Bureau estimated that there were 52.4 million people&#x000a0;aged 65 and older in 2018 in the United States, and projections put that number up to 80.8 million by 2040 (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://agingstats.gov/docs/LatestReport/OA20_508_10142020.pdf">Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics</ext-link>). As the aging population increases, the number of traumatic injuries in older adults also rises.</p>
        <p>Age-related changes place&#x000a0;older adults at greater risk of morbidity and mortality, which can make caring for&#x000a0;them challenging.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Older adults are more likely to have mild-to-severe cognitive impairment, cardiovascular disease, and multiorgan insufficiency that results in general frailty. These age-related physiologic changes often limit the older adult's response to traumatic injury and&#x000a0;elevate their risk of complications and death compared to their younger counterparts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r4">[4]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-22221.s3" sec-type="Etiology">
        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>Falls are the most common mechanism of injury in older adults, followed by motor vehicle&#x000a0;accidents and burns. According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2014 alone, older Americans experienced 29 million falls, causing 7 million injuries, costing an estimated $31 billion in annual Medicare costsDetermining the cause of the fall is an important element of the care plan for each patient, as the fall may result from an isolated mechanical process or a systemic condition that puts the patient at risk for additional falls. When assessing these patients, the patient&#x02019;s functional status before the fall, along with the location and circumstances of the fall, should be considered.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Even if a reliable mechanical cause of the fall can be established, a complete medical evaluation should be considered to evaluate for a pathological condition that caused the fall. Occult anemia, electrolyte abnormalities, and disorders of glucose metabolism should be considered.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>Attention should also be paid to the possibility of cardiovascular causes of the fall, including orthostatic hypotension, dysrhythmia, and myocardial infarction. Other pathological states that can lead to falls include infection from urinary, pulmonary, or soft tissue sources. Neurologic disorders, including primary or secondary seizures, should be on the differential diagnosis. The role of polypharmacy and potential disruptions to normal physiologic function cannot be understated.</p>

        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>Trauma is the fifth leading cause of death in older adults and accounts for up to 25% of all trauma admissions nationally. Those aged 65 and older&#x000a0;are more prone to traumatic injuries due to factors such as decreased bone density, slower reflexes, and a higher prevalence of comorbidities. Special considerations include polypharmacy, decreased functional reserve, and increased morbidity and mortality compared to younger adults.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r6">[6]</xref>&#x000a0;Mortality from traumatic injuries increases after age 70 when adjusting for injury severity score. Prehospital trauma triage criteria specific to older adults improve the identification of those needing trauma center care.</p>

        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>Aging brings about a host of fascinating physiological changes that reflect the resilience and adaptability of the human body. While certain functions may slow down, the body often compensates remarkably by developing greater efficiency in some processes and prioritizing essential functions. The many anatomic and physiologic changes in multisystem organ function associated with normal aging must be considered when&#x000a0;caring for&#x000a0;an older patient with a traumatic injury.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Nutritional</bold>
</p>
        <p>Older&#x000a0;patients may present with various degrees of malnutrition. Malnutrition may be due to a lack of protein or total caloric intake. Various mineral and supplement deficiencies should also be considered. These nutritional shortcomings may be multifactorial, such as living on a fixed income, inability to obtain&#x000a0;healthy food from stores, reduced appetite, poor taste, and inability to prepare meals or feed oneself. Nutritional deficiencies have significant effects, including decreased healing capability and reduced immune responses. Malnourished older patients with traumatic injuries are at a higher risk for morbidity and mortality.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Integument/Musculoskeletal</bold>
</p>
        <p>Older individuals&#x000a0;have decreased lean body mass, loss of tissue elastance, thinning of the skin, and an overall increase in total body fat. Skin thinning makes thermoregulation more difficult, and older individuals are much more susceptible to hypothermia, even in warm weather conditions. Skin becomes much less resistant to shearing forces as the overall elastic content decreases, increasing susceptibility to skin tears and avulsions even with minor energy transfers. An increase in total body fat results in a larger distribution volume; this needs to be considered when administering medication.</p>
        <p>Bone density is often decreased via demineralization processes, such as osteopenia and osteoporosis. Loss of bone density coupled with loss of lean muscle mass leads to loss of strength and locomotion, balance issues, and decreased ability to produce heat through shivering. Furthermore, loss of bone density leads to a higher risk of fracture with lower energy injury mechanisms.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Neurologic</bold>
</p>
        <p>Neurohumoral responses in&#x000a0;older patients are often blunted, which leads to a slower and less vigorous response to stimuli. Older patients frequently have neurocognitive decline and may present with reduced sensation to nervous stimuli. Comorbidities, such as diabetes, can lead to peripheral neuropathy, a loss of sensation and proprioception, and increased susceptibility to pressure wounds and injuries from falls.</p>
        <p>The brain parenchyma also atrophies and loses volume with age, leading to stretching of the bridging dural veins. When an&#x000a0;older individual has a sudden inertial change, such as a fall with a head strike, these veins are at high risk for rupture, leading to subdural hemorrhage. Compounded with the fact that the brain shrinks in size, but the calvarium maintains a fixed volume, clinical changes associated with intracranial hypertension often present in a delayed fashion as it takes more blood volume to lead to brain compression and shift. This process is somewhat protective because older patients may not immediately have significant clinical deterioration or need emergent surgical intervention to evacuate the hemorrhage.</p>
        <p>Because normal parenchymal atrophy occurs with aging, there may also be systemic changes, such as a decreased ability to autoregulate blood flow. Older patients are more likely to take multiple medications, and&#x000a0;adverse effects of these medications could lead to drowsiness, loss of energy, oversedation, and loss of balance and memory. Prescribed medications can&#x000a0;increase the risk of falls, motor vehicle accidents, and other mechanisms of injury.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Cardiovascular</bold>
</p>
        <p>Connective tissue stiffening comes with&#x000a0;age, and this change notably affects arteries, veins, and the myocardium. The aging heart becomes stiffer and less compliant, losing the ability to increase contraction and cardiac output when experiencing a more significant preload. With time, the cardiac conduction system becomes more fibrotic, and the myocardium becomes less responsive to neurohumoral effects; this all leads to a decreased ability to preserve cardiac output, defined as the product of heart rate and stroke volume.</p>
        <p>For relatively mild hypovolemia, whether due to poor intake with associated dehydration or volume contraction or related to injury with hemorrhage, the resultant drop in preload significantly affects the overall cardiac output in older adults. When the vascular system is desensitized to neurohumoral effects, there is less ability for the systemic vascular resistance to increase the peripheral blood pressure or for the venous system to contract, leading to a decreased ability to increase preload.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>Polypharmacy can have several effects on the cardiovascular system in this demographic. Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and cardiac glycosides may lead to negative inotropic, dromotropic, and chronotropic effects. Under normal circumstances, this is the desired effect of the medication; with an acute insult, these medications prevent the injured host from mounting a normal physiologic response to compensate and maintain homeostasis.</p>
        <p>Shock, defined as global tissue hypoperfusion, is often clinically defined as a systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg. This definition is often incomplete for many patients, especially those older than 65. Current literature supports a systolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg as a better benchmark for identifying occult shock. Furthermore,&#x000a0;multiple indices have been utilized to better detect occult shock instead of using&#x000a0;one discrete variable, such as heart rate, blood pressure, or urine output, as all are insensitive. The shock index is a more sensitive indicator and is calculated as the quotient of the systolic blood pressure and the heart rate (shock index= heart rate/systolic blood pressure). A shock index of 0.5 to 0.7 is considered normal. However, when it is greater than 0.7, the patient is deemed to be in shock.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r8">[8]</xref> Further iterations of this index have also been proposed, which are felt to be more sensitive, such as the respiratory-adjusted shock index&#x000a0;(RASI). RASI is calculated by multiplying the shock index by (respiratory rate/10). When the RASI is greater than 1.3, it suggests that the patient is in occult shock.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Pulmonary</bold>
</p>
        <p>Overall, pulmonary function deteriorates in older adults. With age, the elastic recoil of lung parenchyma decreases as the number of crosslinking elastic fibers decreases. Older adults typically have less functional residual&#x000a0;and vital lung capacities, with the total lung capacity either staying the same or mildly decreasing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;Formal pulmonary function testing often reveals that&#x000a0;this population has lower forced expiratory volumes over&#x000a0;1 second and forced vital capacity. Therefore, the respiratory reserve is limited, and the ability to adapt compensatory physiologic processes to hypoxia, hypercarbia, and metabolic abnormalities, such as acidosis, is blunted. Clinically, even small perturbations to the&#x000a0;older patient may manifest in respiratory failure, and often, the clinical signs or symptoms may be subtle.</p>
        <p>Additionally, as&#x000a0;older adults lose lean muscle mass, their ability to recruit secondary respiratory muscles is decreased.&#x000a0;Along&#x000a0;with loss of tissue elastance and greater total body fat deposition, there is a decrease in chest wall compliance. Age-related osteoporosis may also alter thoracic geometry, reducing diaphragmatic curvature and decreasing maximal transdiaphragmatic pressure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r11">[11]</xref></p>
        <p>Suboptimal nutritional intake also contributes as&#x000a0;older individuals often have inanition contributing to respiratory failure as&#x000a0;they tire from attempting to compensate for metabolic disturbances. Atelectasis is very common in this demographic, and atelectasis can lead to underlying ventilation-to-perfusion mismatch with a resultant increase in pulmonary shunting.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>The ability to maintain proper pulmonary hygiene also decreases with age, and there is often chronic airway colonization with microbes. The normal pseudostratified ciliated epithelium and goblet cells, which are responsible for the mucociliary escalator, fail to remove microbes and particulate matter from the lower airways, and the older adult&#x02019;s cough is often weak due to loss of muscle mass, which prevents effective pulmonary hygiene.</p>
        <p>Chronic aspiration due to dysphagia is often seen in this patient population, which significantly affects the underlying pulmonary function. Chronic aspiration should be considered in all older adults with a history of obesity, sedating medications, gastroparesis associated with diabetes, or gastroesophageal reflux to prevent worsening aspiration and respiratory failure if laid supine. Strict aspiration precautions and, if indicated, gastric tube decompression should be considered to prevent this possibly catastrophic event.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Gastrointestinal</bold>
</p>
        <p>Poor dentition leads older patients to become edentulous, necessitating prosthetic dentures. Loss of the ability to chew foods can lead to poor nutritional intake. Salivary glands also atrophy, leading to decreased saliva production, which impairs the lubrication of the food bolus, making the process of deglutition more challenging. Transfer of the food bolus from the oropharynx to the esophagus is also impaired and can lead to aspiration as prior protective aerodigestive reflexes are often blunted or absent.</p>
        <p>Multiple medications affect the gastric lining and acidic milieu. These alterations can worsen the protective mechanisms of the gastric wall and lead to gastritis and other forms of peptic ulcer disease. The pharmaceutical alkalization of gastric acid can lead to microbial overgrowth. In this case, if aspiration does occur, it can lead to a higher rate of pulmonary infection.</p>
        <p>Gastric and intestinal wall integrity is also affected by age, leading to poor absorption of both micro- and macronutrients and malnutrition. Additionally, overall motility is slowed as the tissues become less responsive to neurohumoral and endocrine stimuli. Older adults have been shown to have an increased number of uncoordinated esophageal contractions and decreased gastric emptying.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r10">[10]</xref> This can lead to a higher risk of reflux in this age group.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Over time, the liver loses its overall parenchymal mass, and blood flow to the liver decreases, resulting in a worsening ability to filter the bloodstream. The liver&#x02019;s intrinsic ability to make proteins, such as albumin, is also diminished, which can lead to a decrease in oncotic pressure and worsening of the third-spacing of fluids. Also, free drug concentrations can increase in the face of hypoalbuminemia, leading to unwanted toxicities and&#x000a0;adverse effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r10">[10]</xref></p>
        <p>Decreased hepatic production of thrombopoietin can lead to thrombocytopenia due to decreased stimulation of the megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors are also diminished due to poor oral vitamin K intake and loss of hepatic synthetic function. Both factors can lead to a higher risk of coagulopathy in the geriatric trauma population.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Genitourinary</bold>
</p>
        <p>Urinary incontinence exists at a higher rate in&#x000a0;older persons. This condition is partially due to neurohumoral desensitization of the bladder detrusor muscle. When the detrusor fails to contract, postvoid residual volumes can increase, leading to higher rates of bacterial overgrowth with infection and postobstructive renal failure. Prostatism in men is another common cause of the inability to micturate completely. Medications common to the older adult population may lead to acute urinary retention as well. Urinary tract infection is another common occult cause of altered mental status and should be sought early and appropriately treated if found.</p>
        <p>Like other organs, the kidneys also are subject to parenchymal tissue loss with age. The nephron load in the renal cortex is most affected. The glomerular filtration rate is decreased, leading to problems with the clearance of solutes and water reabsorption, which in turn leads to disturbances in fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. Seeing a decrease in creatinine as lean muscle mass decreases with age is not uncommon,&#x000a0;but there can also be an associated increase in the tubular secretion of creatinine. As a result, serum creatinine levels can be within the normal range but may be misleading as renal function may still be grossly impaired.</p>
        <p>Creatinine clearance, CCR (mL/minute)= {[(140 - age) x mass (kg)] /(serum creatinine&#x000a0;x 72)}, is often a better way to measure and determine renal function, especially in the&#x000a0;older population. Creatinine clearance is known to decrease with age variably and may be due to vascular changes in the kidney&#x000a0;leading to glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r12">[12]</xref> Many medications may need to be renally-adjusted to prevent nephrotoxicity.</p>
        <p>Neurohumoral stimulation of the kidneys also declines with age. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is downregulated, making the host less responsive to hypovolemia and salt retention. As renal function declines, the kidney becomes less responsive to hypoxia, leading to decreased erythropoietin production and anemia. The ability of vitamin D to undergo hydroxylation also decreases, putting&#x000a0;older patients at higher risk for osteomalacia and osteoporotic fractures.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Hematologic</bold>
</p>
        <p>Bone marrow mass may also decrease with age. Fat replaces marrow, and hematopoietic reserves decline. The marrow itself also becomes less sensitive to stimulatory hormones. The functionality of the red cells, platelets, and leukocytes all develop qualitative defects even though, quantitatively, they may be normal.</p>
        <p>Anemia is prevalent in older adults, and a differential should be obtained. The mean corpuscular volume helps delineate the cause of the anemia further. Macrocytic anemia is usually caused by folate or B12 deficiencies, most commonly caused by poor nutritional intake or absorption issues, both seen in older adults. Microcytic anemia is often due to iron deficiency&#x000a0;or other dietary inadequacies, but it can be secondary to other causes, such as occult blood loss. Anemias should be evaluated and corrected to help preserve or increase oxygen-carrying capacity.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Immune</bold>
</p>
        <p>Decrements in immune function are commonly seen in older individuals. Loss of immune function has been found to contribute to increased infection risk, autoimmune disorders, and malignancies. Generalized malnutrition with vitamin and mineral deficiencies is often seen and is a significant cause of immune dysfunction.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Endocrine</bold>
</p>
        <p>Older adults are at higher risk for impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes due to a relative decrease in insulin secretion by &#x003b2;-cells and peripheral insulin resistance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r13">[13]</xref> Many&#x000a0;older patients are on systemic steroids, which may lead to hyperglycemia, immunosuppression, and decreased wound healing rates. Furthermore, chronic glucocorticoid therapy is associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression, which puts patients at risk for adrenal suppression, requiring stress dosing at times of surgery, traumatic injury, or during critical illness. Also, many older adults are on thyroid hormone replacement therapy, and critically ill patients may become hypothyroid or euthyroid-sick. The astute clinician should keep these common endocrinopathies in mind when&#x000a0;caring for an older adult with traumatic injuries.</p>

        <p>The history and physical examination of an older adult with a traumatic injury require a comprehensive and meticulous approach, recognizing the complexities of aging. The history should include details of the trauma event, preexisting medical conditions, medications, and baseline functional status, including cognitive and sensory abilities. Particular attention should be paid to medications that affect coagulation, cardiovascular stability, and cognitive function, as these can significantly impact the patient&#x02019;s response to trauma.&#x000a0;All resources available for collateral information&#x000a0;should be utilized.</p>
        <p>During the physical examination, clinicians must carefully assess for subtle signs of injury, which may be masked by age-related changes such as reduced pain sensation and altered mental status. A thorough physical examination entails vital signs, neurological status, and a head-to-toe assessment to identify potential injuries. Often, vital signs appear normal until the patient deteriorates rapidly, as physiologic reserve is poor in this population.&#x000a0;Blood pressure and pulse may mislead and be altered by polypharmacy. Bruising, skin tears, and hematomas should be evaluated for underlying injury.&#x000a0;Comorbid conditions must be taken into consideration.&#x000a0;Given the higher risk of complications, even seemingly minor trauma in&#x000a0;older adults warrants a detailed and cautious evaluation to ensure optimal care and outcomes.</p>

        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>Advanced trauma life support protocols should be followed during the initial evaluation of an older patient with a traumatic injury. A complete assessment, including medical, cognitive, functional, and social assessments, should be performed.&#x000a0;Due to the possibility of&#x000a0;subtle&#x000a0;pathological disease states or occult injury, a&#x000a0;thorough evaluation should be considered even if a reliable history of a mechanical fall can be established.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r14">[14]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r15">[15]</xref></p>
        <p>Older adults with traumatic injuries should be evaluated for frailty upon admission. Frailty is considered a syndrome of physiologic deterioration that may occur with aging and is often characterized as an inability to adapt to acute illness or stress, which leads to a more significant number of complications, including the need for long-term care, disability, and even death.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r16">[16]</xref></p>
        <p>Frailty is not solely defined by age. Many patients younger than 65 have chronically poor health and meet the definition of frailty. Frailty has traditionally been thought of as a physical deterioration in which patients exhibit weight loss, loss of lean muscle mass with associated weakness, and decrease in walking speed, all secondary to biological deterioration. However, newer views of frailty incorporate this concept with the idea that there is also a concurrent deficit accumulation, such as social impairment and cognitive decline.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>No gold standard test is currently available to detect frailty; many tools have been developed to help determine who is most at risk for an adverse outcome or prognosis. One of these easily applied screening tools is the FRAIL scale. The FRAIL score looks at&#x000a0;<bold>f</bold>atigue,&#x000a0;<bold>r</bold>esistance (ability to climb 1 flight of stairs,<bold>&#x000a0;a</bold>mbulation (ability to walk 1 block),&#x000a0;<bold>i</bold>llnesses (&#x0003e;5), and&#x000a0;loss of weight (&#x0003e;5%). A score of 0 is best, and 5 is worst, where scores of 3 to 5 are considered frail, 1 to 2 pre-frail, and 0 good health.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r17">[17]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r18">[18]</xref> One trauma-specific frailty index for older adults has been developed, which utilizes 15 variables that can be abstracted from a patient&#x02019;s chart to help clinicians plan discharge disposition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r19">[19]</xref></p>
        <p>Other tools have been developed to aid in the prognostication for in-hospital mortality in older adults with traumatic injuries. One of these is the geriatric trauma outcome score (GTOS); (age) + (2.5 &#x000d7; injury severity score) + 22 (if packed red blood cell transfused within &#x02264;24 hours of admission). This tool has been validated as a prognostic indicator for in-hospital mortality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r20">[20]</xref> Newer predictors of mortality after trauma in this population have recently been published. The quick elderly mortality after trauma&#x000a0;is scored on the initial patient presentation, and the full elderly mortality after trauma is calculated&#x000a0;after radiologic evaluation.&#x000a0;Both scores&#x000a0;were found to estimate the probability of in-hospital mortality accurately.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r21">[21]</xref></p>

        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>Based on the history and physical examination coupled with risk factor assessment, general screening laboratory&#x000a0;tests such as complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, electrocardiogram, urinalysis, and radiographic studies should be considered. Central nervous system imaging should be considered in patients taking antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications if the mechanism of injury raises suspicion for injury.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r22">[22]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r23">[23]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r24">[24]</xref>&#x000a0;Patients taking anticoagulants found to have a significant intracranial hemorrhage require aggressive treatment. Reversal of the anticoagulant should be considered in the appropriate clinical context and&#x000a0;should be based on institution-specific guidelines.</p>
        <p>Oral anticoagulants, such as dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban, are indicated for various clinical conditions that affect older adults. These include treatment of venous thromboembolism, stroke prophylaxis in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and acute coronary syndrome. The&#x000a0;novel direct oral anticoagulants&#x000a0;have a different mechanism of action than warfarin, which acts to inhibit Xa and thrombin IIa in the coagulation cascade. Reversal of the anticoagulation caused by&#x000a0;newer oral anticoagulants requires specific agents.&#x000a0;Dabigatrin has a monoclonal antibody reversal agent,&#x000a0;idarucizumab.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r25">[25]</xref>Andexanet alfa can be used to reverse anticoagulation in patients taking factor Xa inhibitors, such as apixaban and rivaroxaban.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r26">[26]</xref></p>
        <p>Reversal of anticoagulation caused by warfarin historically relied on using vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Recent literature suggests that relying on vitamin K and FFP might be less effective than using vitamin K and prothrombin complex concentrates.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r27">[27]</xref> Vitamin K and FFP therapy often require 30 to 60 min to thaw the FFP. Further, large volumes of FFP in the range of 30 mL/kg (4 to 12 units) are often required for adequate reversal. The time to infuse the necessary&#x000a0;volume of FFP can complicate and delay care. Treatment with vitamin K and prothrombin complex concentrates avoids these limitations.&#x000a0;Prothrombin complex concentrates&#x000a0;do not require blood group system compatibility testing, and infusion volumes are less than 100 mL.</p>

        <p>When evaluating older patients with traumatic injuries, it is crucial to consider a broad range of differential diagnoses due to the complexity and variability of age-related physiological changes. The differential diagnoses should encompass both common and less obvious conditions that may mimic or complicate traumatic injuries. Accurate diagnosis requires careful consideration of the patient's history, physical examination findings, and any underlying health issues that could influence the presentation and management of trauma.

        <title>Prognosis</title>
        <p>Patients who are older with trauma have a higher mortality rate than younger patients.&#x000a0;The prognosis of patients who are older with trauma often hinges on several critical factors, including the severity of the injury, the presence of comorbid conditions, and the patient&#x02019;s overall functional status. Older adults typically face a more challenging recovery compared to younger individuals due to diminished physiological reserves and the increased likelihood of complications such as infections, cardiovascular events, and delayed wound healing. For example, patients who are older with&#x000a0;3 to 4 rib fractures have a 19% increased mortality risk and 31% risk of pneumonia, and these risks increase with each additional rib fracture.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r28">[28]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>As evidence-based medicine and informed care have evolved, the prognoses for patients who are older and severely injured have steadily improved.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r29">[29]</xref>&#x000a0;With prompt, specialized care and a multidisciplinary approach, many patients can achieve meaningful recovery and improved quality of life. Early intervention, tailored treatment plans, and effective rehabilitation are key to enhancing outcomes and minimizing long-term impacts. Overall, while the prognosis for patients who are older with trauma can be guarded, a well-coordinated care strategy can significantly improve the likelihood of a favorable outcome.</p>

        <title>Complications</title>
        <p>Complications in patients who are older with a traumatic injury are often more frequent and severe due to the physiological changes associated with aging. These complications may include infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections, which can exacerbate the patient's condition and complicate recovery. Cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias, are also a significant risk due to the stress of trauma on an aging heart.</p>
        <p>Additionally, patients who are older are more prone to prolonged immobilization, which can lead to deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and muscle atrophy. Delayed wound healing and the potential for delirium or cognitive decline further complicate the clinical picture. Addressing these risks requires vigilant monitoring, proactive management strategies, and a multidisciplinary approach to ensure optimal outcomes and mitigate the impact of these complications.</p>

        <p>Rehabilitation care for patients who are older with trauma is a critical component of the recovery process, focusing on restoring functional independence and enhancing quality of life. Given the unique challenges older adults face, rehabilitation programs must be tailored to address their specific needs, including mobility limitations, muscle weakness, and cognitive impairments. A multidisciplinary approach often involves physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech therapists, who work together to develop individualized plans that promote safe and effective recovery. Emphasis is placed on gradual, goal-oriented therapy that accommodates the patient&#x02019;s overall health status and addresses comorbid conditions. Effective rehabilitation not only aids in physical recovery but also helps prevent complications, reduce disability, and support a return to daily activities, ultimately contributing to a more fulfilling and autonomous life for&#x000a0;affected patients.</p>

Engaging specialists such as geriatricians, who can provide insights into managing the multifaceted aspects of aging, is crucial. Additionally, consultations with orthopedic surgeons, neurologists, cardiologists, and other relevant specialists ensure comprehensive care for specific injuries and underlying health issues. For patients experiencing cognitive decline or delirium, the involvement of neurologists or psychiatrists may be necessary to address these challenges. Moreover, collaboration with rehabilitation experts and social workers can facilitate a smooth transition from hospital to home, ensuring ongoing support and resources.

        <p>The undertriage of patients who are older with traumatic injuries at risk for moderate-to-severe injury is a major problem and often begins during the prehospital assessment. Study results have shown that patients who are older and treated at a trauma center have improved outcomes<bold>.&#x000a0;</bold>Other studies' results found that compared with younger patients with similar injury severity scores, patients&#x000a0;older than 70 had a 3-fold increase in mortality.<bold>&#x000a0;</bold>Based on these and other study results, the American College of Surgeons triage criteria suggest that patients 55 and older should be considered for transport to a trauma center&#x000a0;for care.<bold>&#x000a0;</bold>Also, geriatric trauma criteria have been implemented at the state level to address undertriage. Data on the use of geriatric trauma criteria suggest overall outcomes have improved. Prehospital&#x000a0;healthcare professionals must maintain a high clinical suspicion for serious injury, regardless of the mechanism of injury.</p>
        <p>When evaluating an older trauma patient, elder abuse&#x000a0;must be considered. There is an estimation that more than 10% of individuals 65 and older in the United States experience some form of elder abuse. The abuse&#x000a0;can present in many ways,&#x000a0;for example, physical, emotional, financial, sexual, and neglect. Physicians should maintain a high level of suspicion to identify those at risk.

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>Traumatic injuries in older adults&#x000a0;are on the rise and often present in sinister ways.&#x000a0;Due to advanced age, a decline in organ function, and limited reserve, patients who are older with trauma are more likely to die compared to younger people when sustaining the same type of&#x000a0;trauma. Thus, assessment and treatment of older patients must be conducted&#x000a0;by considering their unique physiology and associated&#x000a0;comorbidity. Due to the inherent challenges of traumatic injuries in older populations, an interprofessional approach involving physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, physical, occupational, and speech therapists, nutritionists, social workers, and other health professionals is essential for optimizing care and outcomes are necessary.</p>
        <p>Physicians and advanced clinicians bring diagnostic and clinical management expertise, focusing on acute care, treatment planning, and coordination of interventions. Nurses provide crucial bedside care, monitoring vital signs, administering medications, and offering emotional support. Pharmacists play a key role in managing complex medication regimens, assessing potential drug interactions, and educating patients on medication adherence. Physical, occupational, and speech therapists and social workers play crucial roles in caring for these patients by addressing rehabilitation needs, enhancing daily living skills, improving communication abilities, and coordinating community resources and support services. Each professional must employ strategies tailored to older patients' physiological and functional needs, incorporating evidence-based practices and individualized care plans. All team members should consider&#x000a0;elder abuse, which can present with somatic and neuropsychiatric&#x000a0;features.</p>
        <p>Most patients who are older can heal after trauma, but the healing period is long. Many often remain in the hospital for prolonged periods and, even when discharged, tend to have a residual loss in function. As the care of patients who are older with trauma improves, it is hoped that morbidity and mortality will decrease. Meanwhile, the onus is on healthcare professionals to recognize early signs of injury in this vulnerable population and to optimize care and recovery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r30">[30]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r31">[31]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-22221.r32">[32]</xref></p>
