        <p>Drug and alcohol use disorders in the workplace are common problems; high prevalence in healthcare settings has increased awareness of the issue. When these disorders occur in healthcare settings, the risk of career-ending consequences and the potential for unintended harm to patients make this an issue of high importance. Coworkers, as well as members of the interdisciplinary team, should&#x000a0;be able to recognize signs and symptoms of substance use disorders&#x000a0;so that impaired practitioners can receive assistance. Helping&#x000a0;other healthcare team members will improve patient safety and lead to better retention of healthcare providers.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>This activity reviews the different facets of substance abuse disorders found in the workplace, the rules and regulations in Florida's Nurse Practice Act for nurses regarding the use of alcohol and drugs as the basis for disciplinary actions, and the proactive Intervention Project for Nurses strategy the state of Florida is utilizing to address this issue. The crucial&#x000a0;role of the interprofessional team in recognizing and helping coworkers who have substance use disorders is highlighted in this activity.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p content-type="pubmed-excerpt">Alcohol use disorder and other substance use disorders represent a significant problem for healthcare professionals. Without identification and appropriate treatment, impairment&#x000a0;usually progresses and compromises not only the workplace but, more importantly, threatens patient safety. The danger is significantly worse when the impaired health professional is responsible for treating critically ill patients in the intensive care unit, emergency department, or operating room. Medical professionals must recognize signs of this disorder in their peers for the sake of patients and those afflicted healthcare providers themselves.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41854.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41854.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41854.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41854.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41854.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p content-type="pubmed-excerpt">Health professional impairment is, unfortunately, much too&#x000a0;frequently seen.&#x000a0;Impairment results when a health professional, a physician, nurse, or allied health professional is unable to provide competent and safe patient care because of&#x000a0;any substance use disorder.&#x000a0;Any illicit substance, as well as prescription and non-prescription drugs, can impair the professional.&#x000a0; Impairment may also result from&#x000a0;a psychological or&#x000a0;physical condition that affects the health professional's judgment, such as overwhelming chronic pain.&#x000a0;Any disorder, mental, physical, or substance-related, can cause the healthcare professional to lose focus and be unable to safely and effectively perform the duties required by their profession.&#x000a0;Recognition of this inability to safely and effectively perform to the best of their ability is the determining factor in recognition of any performance-limiting impairment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41854.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p>
        <p content-type="pubmed-excerpt">All health professionals must be aware of the safety issues that become apparent when a health professional is impaired. Ultimately, the signs and symptoms of impairment and the state and institution requirements for reporting individuals&#x000a0;suspected of working while in an impaired state are critical to preventing injury to patients and loss of the professional expertise of afflicted colleagues.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41854.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41854.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41854.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <p content-type="pubmed-excerpt">Impaired health professionals&#x000a0;usually develop coping mechanisms that allow them to initially cover up their diminished capacity to provide safe patient care. Eventually, mistakes become more evident,&#x000a0;medication errors are made more often, or procedural errors become more apparent. Initially, these violations may be subtle, and only an astute and observant fellow practitioner will notice a change in behavior or the signs and symptoms of impairment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41854.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;One common occurrence is the diversion by a health care professional of controlled substances such as opioids and benzodiazepines&#x000a0;from a patient to themselves.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41854.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0; The diversion can result in a patient being under-medicated or suffering unnecessarily due to a lack of appropriate medications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41854.r10">[10]</xref></p>
        <p content-type="pubmed-excerpt">The&#x000a0;misuse of substances over time&#x000a0;also&#x000a0;may result in the deterioration of the health professional's well-being. Use of stimulants, for example, may result in cardiovascular problems such as angina, hypertension, and myocardial infarction. Alcohol can lead to liver diseases such as cirrhosis. Patients suffer exposure to infectious diseases such as human immunodeficiency, hepatitis, and other blood-borne diseases. There are often coexisting mental disorders such as depression and anxiety; suicide can be an outcome for some. Impairment can lead to traumatic injuries such as falls, fractures, and head injuries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41854.r11">[11]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41854.r12">[12]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41854.r13">[13]</xref></p>

<bold>Florida State and Federal Rules and Regulations</bold>
</p>
        <p>Virtually all states include rules and regulations regarding the use of alcohol and drugs as the basis for disciplinary actions. Authorities deal with the diversion of drugs from patients very&#x000a0;harshly. Almost all states also require reporting of health practitioners suspected of impairment. These rules and penalties vary from state to state.</p>
        <p>The Florida Nurse Practice Act&#x000a0;is an example of the typical state law regarding the use of controlled substances and the necessary reporting.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&#x00026;URL=0400-0499/0464/Sections/0464.018.html">[leg.state.fl.us, 2018]</ext-link>&#x000a0;Each practitioner should consult the rules and regulations for their own profession.</p>

In enforcing this paragraph, the department shall have, upon a finding of the secretary or the secretary's designee that probable cause exists to believe that the licensee is unable to practice nursing because of the reasons stated in this paragraph, the authority to issue an order to compel a licensee to submit to a mental or physical examination by physicians designated by the department. If the licensee refuses to comply with such an order, the department's order directing such examination may be enforced by filing a petition for enforcement in the circuit court where the licensee resides or does business. The licensee against whom the petition is filed shall not be named or identified by initials in any public court records or documents, and the proceedings shall be closed to the public. The department shall be entitled to the summary procedure provided in s. 51.011. A nurse affected by the provisions of this paragraph shall, at reasonable intervals, receive an opportunity to demonstrate that she or he can resume the competent practice of nursing with reasonable skill and safety to patients.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&#x00026;URL=0400-0499/0464/0464.html">[leg.state.fl.us, 2018]</ext-link></p>

<bold>
<italic toggle="yes">All states have varying rules regarding the evaluation and prosecution of a healthcare practitioner who, due to mental illness or illicit use of controlled substances, places a patient's safety at risk.

<bold>
<italic toggle="yes">Most states have the right to specifically penalize a health professional who fails to report another health professional whom they know violates state laws.

</p>
        <p>(4)&#x000a0; The board shall not reinstate the license of a nurse who has been found guilty by the board on three separate occasions of violations of this chapter relating to the use of drugs or opioids, which offenses involved the diversion of drugs or opioids from patients to personal use or sale.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&#x00026;URL=0400-0499/0464/0464.html">[leg.state.fl.us, 2018]</ext-link></p>
        <p>In many states, the ongoing use of drugs or alcohol can result in the permanent loss of a medical license.</p>
        <p>It is crucial that all health professionals review the Health Practice Act in each state where they hold a license and that they comply with the reporting requirements. If one is unsure of the requirements, most institutions will provide an attorney or other professional to understand the reporting process.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41854.r14">[14]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41854.r15">[15]</xref></p>
        <p>Most states have statutes to help healthcare practitioners identify and treat impaired healthcare providers. Virtually all state medical boards require that a healthcare provider suffering from alcohol or drug substance use self-report, and individuals aware of the problem must report their peers.&#x000a0;Due to the fear of reprisal, most states have a mechanism whereby a provider can confidentially report a peer directly to an agency that can investigate and deal with the problem.&#x000a0;Providing there are no safety issues that directly affect a patient's care, the impaired practitioner can engage in treatment and rehabilitation and avoid board disciplinary action.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41854.r16">[16]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41854.r17">[17]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41854.r18">[18]</xref></p>
        <p>If a health professional is already under discipline, has been terminated from rehabilitation, has sold drugs, or is at continuous risk to the public, the practitioner is less likely to receive the opportunity to seek private treatment without public consequences.&#x000a0;However, if there is no danger to the patients, even The Joint Commission supports treatment rather than punishment.</p>
        <p>To a certain extent, federal laws protect health professionals with substance use disorders. The Americans with Disabilities Act provides protection for healthcare providers in treatment and recovery programs for substance use disorders. It requires a "reasonable accommodation" for an individual who recognizes their alcohol or drug issues and participates in a rehabilitation program. Federal law does not&#x000a0;consider a person to have a disability because they are using drugs. The Family Medical Leave Act requires employers to allow time off for qualified&#x000a0;substance use disorder treatment.</p>
        <p>Courts and statutes usually protect healthcare providers' and medical boards' efforts to address substance use disorder issues, particularly if practitioners have successfully completed treatment. However, if a practitioner harms a patient while under the influence of drugs or alcohol or an institution knowingly fails to protect a patient, the consequences can be severe. Examples include the following:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>A court granted immunity to the director of an impaired practitioner program, who suggested that healthcare professionals' privileges be suspended until they completed substance use disorder evaluation and treatment.</p>

            <p>The rate of drug use by healthcare providers is thought to be as much as five times higher than the reference rate for nonmedical professionals.

        <p>Substance use among doctors,&#x000a0;nurses, and allied health professionals is&#x000a0;related to a&#x000a0;variety of factors; for example, personality traits that lead&#x000a0;individuals to select high-stress positions in medicine, such as high achievement, obsessiveness, and a high work ethic&#x000a0;also&#x000a0;may influence an individual to chose stimulants to maintain what they believe&#x000a0;is a higher level of performance. Health professionals also have relatively&#x000a0;direct access to prescription drugs, making it easier to obtain addicting medications. Health professionals tend to use benzodiazepines and opiates more than illicit street drugs, most likely due to the ease of access. Substance use in healthcare providers is expected to increase due to&#x000a0;long hours, stress, and increasingly widespread workforce shortages in healthcare.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41854.r25">[25]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41854.r26">[26]</xref></p>

        <p>The <italic toggle="yes">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition</italic> (DSM-5) defines a substance use disorder which is divided into mild, moderate, and severe. Substance use disorders occur when the recurrent use of alcohol and/or drugs causes significant impairment, including health problems, disability, and the inability&#x000a0;to meet major responsibilities at home, work, or school. A substance use disorder diagnosis is based on evidence of social impairment, impaired control, risky use, and pharmacological criteria.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41854.r27">[27]</xref></p>

<bold>Substance Use Disorder</bold>
</p>
        <p>As with most behavioral and psychiatric disorders, the interplay between genetic risk, temperamental traits, and the environment may predispose an individual to substances use. Once exposed to substances, brain reward systems reinforce substance use, resulting in repeated use and lower ability to control substance use.&#x000a0;</p>

          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Lapses in clinical judgment and performance are usually late signs of impairment, making diagnosis difficult unless the practitioner admits they have a problem.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>Impaired practitioners, as well as their colleagues and patients, are unlikely to take action until an alcohol or drug problem has reached a critical level and resulted in a significant healthcare disaster or a legal entanglement.</p>
        <p>For this reason, healthcare workers must recognize a clear ethical, moral, and legal duty to identify and report an impaired colleague. Unfortunately, while most health professionals consider alcohol and drug use to be a disease, health professionals are often reluctant to report their concerns. It is difficult for a colleague to confront a potentially impaired healthcare provider for fear of damaging the professional's reputation, especially if the suspicion is proven wrong.</p>
        <p>Regrettably,&#x000a0;only an average of 2 out of 3 healthcare practitioners&#x000a0;with direct, personal knowledge of a colleague's&#x000a0;impairment will&#x000a0;report a peer to the proper authority&#x000a0;professionals despite the legal risk for not reporting. However, in many cases, reporting may be the only approach encouraging the impaired doctor, nurse, or allied health professional to seek evaluation and treatment.</p>
        <p>Impairment may be due to alcohol, street drugs, or taking prescription drugs from a patient, friend, or family member. Health professionals may take injectable medications from a patient or dilute the drug with saline.&#x000a0;</p>

        <p>Many health professionals may turn to&#x000a0;alcohol and drugs when going through a stressful time in their lives. They may use illicit substances to help them cope with problems such as family issues, malpractice cases, work stress, or financial pressures.</p>
        <p>Alcohol and drug addiction is compulsive behavior. It&#x000a0;may develop from an unhappy life, poor life choices, a family history of addiction, boredom, denial, or thrill-seeking.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Institutional Considerations</bold>
</p>
        <p>Most health professionals lack training and education regarding the signs and symptoms of addiction, identifying those addicted, and the correct manner to engage in the intervention.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>All health professionals should receive education regarding alcohol and substance use disorders. Employers need to assist in improving physician, nurse, and allied health professionals' knowledge about the signs and symptoms, how to report them, and available treatment options.</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>

        </list>
        <p>The policy at any healthcare facility should be an alcohol and drug-free environment. The following mechanisms can decrease worksite impairment:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Pre-employment drug testing</p>

            <p>Regular practice evaluations</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>Each of these is controversial. While most institutions support pre-employment and cause testing, less support exists for random testing of healthcare professionals. Further, not all professionals working in a hospital setting are necessarily employees of the institution. This&#x000a0;fact may make it difficult for an institution to mandate screening.</p>
        <p>Institutions should promote a culture that delineates the expectations of employees and consequences. A policy that supports providing help with alcohol and drug use disorders should also be in place.</p>
        <p>Institutions have an opportunity to help identify employees and practitioners with alcohol and drug impairment. In particular, supervisors should be trained in the signs and symptoms of alcohol and drug use disorder. They should be familiar with the institution's policies and procedures for getting the individual the help they need.</p>

        <p>Often, the evaluation and treatment of a health professional with alcohol or drug addiction are challenging. Typical treatment occurs over months to years and includes follow-up and monitoring, sometimes by legal entities. The most important predictor of successful treatment is when a healthcare professional admits the addiction and is willing to accept and stick with the prescribed treatment. In many cases, treatment is forced upon a health practitioner by a court or medical board or occurs due to peers, family, and friends encouraging therapy. Those who are self-motivated and have insight into their disease are much more likely to have a successful treatment outcome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41854.r32">[32]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41854.r33">[33]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41854.r34">[34]</xref></p>
        <p>All healthcare providers need to be familiar with peer reporting requirements for&#x000a0;alcohol or&#x000a0;drug addiction within their institution and in their specific state. If someone suspects a colleague has an alcohol or substance use problem,&#x000a0;they should refer the impaired health practitioner to the proper authority in your institution or state. In several states, reporting is required by law.&#x000a0;In states where it is required, as long as reporting that is deemed false is not done with malicious intent, immunity is usually granted. Besides the state and institutional requirements, all health professionals have a duty to "first do no harm"&#x000a0;and protect patients from the harm that might come from an impaired professional.</p>
        <p>Do not wait until impairment affects performance; all health professionals must report at the first sign of impairment. This&#x000a0;report should be considered an act of kindness as the short and long-term consequences are grave for health; an impaired health professional&#x000a0;can harm a patient.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-41854.r35">[35]</xref></p>

            <p>In Florida,&#x000a0;Rule 64B31-10.001 pairs an impaired practitioner with a program or consultant to provide intervention,&#x000a0;evaluation, and referral of impaired health professionals. The program monitors the impaired practitioner. No medical services are provided.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.flrules.org/gateway/RuleNo.asp?id=64B31-10.001">[flrules.org, 2015]</ext-link></p>

        <p>Evaluation and treatment programs are state-licensed and accredited.&#x000a0;Programs usually have a multidisciplinary team to manage the health professional.

        <p>
<bold>Treatment Techniques</bold>
</p>
        <p>Treating any patient for alcohol or drug use disorder is challenging, and it is more challenging if the treatment is under duress. Treatment usually involves the following steps:</p>
        <list list-type="order">
          <list-item>
            <p>Intervention: voluntarily, institution, or mandated by a licensing board</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Evaluation: the health professional is evaluated to determine the degree of their impairment.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Setting: depending on their degree of addiction and whether they may or may not suffer withdrawal, the practitioner will be considered for inpatient or outpatient treatment.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Treatment: counseling, group therapy, or residential inpatient treatment program. In some cases, the health professional is&#x000a0;hospitalized for a few days until withdrawal symptoms resolve.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>Health professionals who accept their disease and are willing to undergo treatment generally have a high success rate. They are usually bright, have a history of high achievement, and have a will to succeed, which is typically a good sign for treatment success. The recovery rates for health practitioners are generally higher than the general population. Most health professionals who undergo intervention and treatment early and have not harmed a patient or committed a crime can retain their licenses and eventually return to clinical practice.</p>

<italic toggle="yes">
<bold>Intensive Outpatient Programs</bold>
</italic>
</p>
        <p>These programs provide regular, intense treatment but limit the disruption to family, school, or work schedules. The practitioner typically stops practice until successful treatment is completed and they have reached the stage of monitoring where they are allowed to return to patient&#x000a0;care. Outpatient licensed counselors usually meet with the practitioner for several hours multiple times each week.</p>
        <p>
<bold>
<italic toggle="yes">Residential Programs</italic>
</bold>
</p>
        <p>These programs are typically located within a hospital or a specialized&#x000a0;facility. Patients live in a highly structured environment. Typically, patients live in the facility for 30 to 90 days. In the early phase, they may undergo medical withdrawal and detoxification. Eventually, these patients transition to outpatient programs.</p>

<italic toggle="yes">Partial Hospitalization Programs</italic>

        <p>It is expensive for an employer to hire and train a health professional. Employers are often willing to assist employees with the help they need to maintain their jobs and careers. By treating an employee, the employer will save the cost of replacing the employee, avoid accidents that harm patient safety and cause liability issues for the institution, decrease absenteeism, and avoid worker compensation claims.</p>

            <p>Many institutions will provide general education to employees regarding the use of alcohol or drugs. For example, they may educate employees on avoiding binge drinking as it results in hangovers, which impair performance and cognitive function. Much like pilots who do not drink 12 hours before a flight, it is similarly vital for a medical professional to avoid alcohol or drug consumption&#x000a0;at least 12 hours before a shift.</p>

        <p>Drug and alcohol use are common problems for health professionals, particularly nurses and doctors.&#x000a0;With the prevalence being high among health practitioners and the risk of consequences rising to career-ending, there is an increasing awareness of the issues. Further, the implications for patients may be life-threatening.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, there is an increasing trend to recognize that individuals with alcohol and drug issues need evaluation and treatment instead of punitive sanctions.</p>
        <p>All health providers need to recognize the signs and symptoms of substance&#x000a0;use. There are appropriate tools to assist peers who need help. Together, healthcare providers can work toward improving patient safety and avoiding the permanent loss of a practitioner who has devoted years to their training.</p>

<bold>Step 2</bold>
</italic>
</p>
        <p>Are you concerned about reporting? Review personal ethics, morals, and the principles under which you became a health professional. A fellow professional should not be allowed to use substances and place a patient's safety at risk. Allowing another professional to continue to use alcohol or drugs and place patients' lives at risk is not appropriate. No matter what the consequences to the individual, reporting is the proper&#x000a0;course of action. Enabling another health professional to cover up their alcohol or drug use is not appropriate, and it is dangerous.</p>
        <p>Do not make excuses or cover up for an impaired professional. The potential is that the individual and their patients will be harmed. Unfortunately, the professional has put themselves in the situation and must accept the consequences.</p>
        <p>
<italic toggle="yes">
<bold>Step 3</bold>
</italic>
</p>
        <p>Consider and review hospital and state reporting requirements. Become educated about the rules and regulations. Most states and institutions will protect a reporting healthcare professional against the retaliation of a colleague. Review the organization's policies and procedures regarding alcohol and substance use and the assistance the institution offers. If unsure, consider contacting the risk management nurse or lawyer of your institution. Usually, either one can assist in following the appropriate steps. If these resources are unavailable, consider discussing the situation with the department manager.</p>
        <p>
<italic toggle="yes">
<bold>Step 4</bold>
</italic>
</p>
        <p>Once a fellow professional is identified as potentially having an alcohol or drug use disorder, report it immediately to avoid any negative consequences for the individual reporting, the patients, or the individual with the disorder.&#x000a0;While it may initially seem negative, reporting a peer is a positive act that protects patients and gets&#x000a0;the colleague into a treatment program before they cause a severe or even fatal medical error. The consequences are severe once criminal behavior occurs or patient safety is at risk. &#x000a0;The sooner an individual is investigated, the less likely they are to do actual harm.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, sometimes, it may be easier to pass the problem on to someone else, but it is crucial not to ignore signs or symptoms of impairment. Transferring an impaired healthcare worker or threatening termination is inappropriate. Passing the problem on to another department or institution is not an ethical or moral solution.</p>

<bold>Example Reporting Requirements [Florida]</bold>
</p>
        <p>Each state has different requirements for reporting an impaired peer. If a health professional believes a peer has an alcohol or drug problem, they must report it to their supervisor and the appropriate state-mandated authorities.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&#x00026;URL=0400-0499/0456/Sections/0456.076.html">[leg.state.fl.us, 2018]</ext-link></p>
        <p>For example, the nurses have developed an effective reporting&#x000a0;and treatment system in Florida. Nurses report to the Florida Department of Health or Intervention Project for Nurses. The call to the Intervention Project for Nurses is confidential. The Intervention Project for Nurses can be reached at 800.840.2720. The Intervention Project for Nurses in Florida provides an opportunity for intervention and monitoring of nurses who use alcohol or drugs. Many states have similar reporting mechanisms for health professionals, including physicians, nurses, and allied health professionals.<bold>[<italic toggle="yes">See Florida Nurse Practice Act S. 455.261]</italic></bold></p>
        <p>In Florida, the Intervention Project for Nurses provides:</p>

          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>In Florida, any practitioner who believes a nurse is unsafe due to using alcohol or drugs should make a report to either the Intervention Project for Nurses or the Department of Health. The Nurse Practice Act [Florida Statute 464.018 1(k)] states, "Failing to report to the department any person who the licensee knows violates this part of the rules of the department or the Board; however, if the licensee verifies that such person is actively participating in a board-approved program for the treatment of a physical or mental condition, the licensee is required to report such person only to an impaired professionals consultant".<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&#x00026;URL=0400-0499/0464/Sections/0464.018.html">[leg.state.fl.us, 2018]</ext-link></p>
        <p>In Florida, the Intervention Project for Nurses provides an acceptable alternative to a legal remedy with discipline. Benefits of the Intervention Project for Nurses include:</p>

<bold>Fitness to Practice</bold>
</p>
        <p>The Intervention Project will evaluate and assess a nurse's ability to safely practice, including stability, recovery, support systems, and specific job skills, including problem-solving, judgment, cognitive function, and coping&#x000a0;skills. The Intervention Project enforces several nurse requirements and determines when they can return to work. Requirements and determinations include the following:</p>
        <list list-type="order">
          <list-item>
            <p>Agree to practice restrictions, including no overtime and settings with less controlled narcotic access</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Agree to random drug screens</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Continued and ongoing treatment</p>

            <p>Workplace monitoring and reporting</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>If a nurse consistently meets the fitness to practice guidelines set in place with positive work and monitoring reports, has negative drug screens, regularly attends support group meetings, and meets their contract agreement, they are quickly reintroduced into the workforce. After the Intervention Project program is successfully completed, fitness to practice is established, and long-term monitoring is completed, the nurse's record is sealed. However, if the nurse fails the process, they will be reported to the Department of Health for disciplinary proceedings.</p>
        <p>The Intervention Project process does not hire the individuals who provide evaluation or treatment, but it does offer appropriate referrals to health professionals skilled in the assessment and treatment of individuals with alcohol or drug addiction. Referrals are made to local addiction specialists who work within the community.</p>
        <p>One downfall of the Intervention Project is that while nurses do not have to pay for a referral to the Intervention Project for Nurses, they are personally responsible for paying for the evaluation, treatment, and random alcohol and drug testing. This&#x000a0;cost can be particularly onerous, considering the nurse is usually unable to work during the initial phases of evaluation and treatment. Fortunately, in many cases, employers and insurance policies pay for these services.</p>

<bold>Professional Responsibilities</bold>
</p>
        <p>Nursing and other health professionals in Florida should know the reporting steps and the option to report to either the Intervention Project for Nursing or the Department of Health.&#x000a0;All health professionals should know how to do the following:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Evaluate peer job performance and consider the possibility of a drug or alcohol problem resulting in deficient performance</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Appropriately intervene</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Identify the patterns of alcohol or drug dependence</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Know when to contact a supervisor, institutional administration, or government agencies</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Recognize the signs and symptoms of impairment</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>Virtually all health professionals will encounter one or more impaired peers during their careers. Without a solid knowledge of how to deal with the situation and a plan of action, significant and dangerous impairment problems may get buried and ignored. This can potentially place the individual, peer, and institution at risk.</p>
        <p>The key is to recognize an impaired peer who needs help, document all findings clearly and concisely, report it to the appropriate manager or state authority, and then ensure the individual gets the help they need.</p>
