        <p>Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by mitochondrial fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation impairment, leading to severe metabolic consequences. The inability to provide energy to tissues during glycogen depletion results in hypoketotic hypoglycemia, the hallmark presentation in young children. Additionally, MCADD may contribute to sudden infant death syndrome cases. While most individuals are asymptomatic at birth, the risk of morbidity and mortality is high during the initial episode. Newborn screening has significantly improved outcomes by preventing severe metabolic crises. However, there is currently no definitive treatment for MCADD, and management primarily involves dietary adjustments and emergency protocols during acute illness or stress.</p>
        <p>Clinicians must be proficient in identifying and managing MCADD to improve patient outcomes. Early diagnosis is critical, as it can dramatically improve prognosis and reduce medical care costs. Newborn screening via tandem mass spectrometry measures medium-chain acylcarnitines, aiding in early detection. Several tests can be used for diagnostic confirmation.&#x000a0;Clinical management requires dietary adjustments and emergency response protocols during acute illness or stress.&#x000a0;This activity for healthcare professionals aims to enhance learners' competence in selecting appropriate diagnostic tests, managing MCADD, and fostering effective interprofessional teamwork to improve outcomes.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Fatty acid oxidation disorders (FAODs) are inborn errors of metabolism that result in deficient energy production during fasting and catabolic stress. Fatty acid oxidation occurs in the mitochondria and involves multiple enzymes to oxidize fatty acid chains. FAODs are categorized by the length of the fatty acid chain affected by each disorder.&#x000a0;Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) is a prevalent FAOD that affects fatty acid chains of C6 to C12 length.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) catalyzes the mitochondria's first step of medium-chain fatty acid oxidation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;MCADD is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the&#x000a0;acyl-CoA dehydrogenase medium chain (<italic toggle="yes">ACADM</italic>) gene.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>The inability to&#x000a0;provide energy to tissues when glycogen stores are depleted&#x000a0;secondary to MCADD results in a wide array of symptoms. Hypoketotic hypoglycemia with vomiting, progressing to seizures, and coma are typical presentations of this disease. MCADD is also thought to be responsible for a small portion of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) cases. This disease may become evident in early childhood, typically within the first 24 months of life, or remain asymptomatic until adulthood.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>While newborn screening (NBS) has helped in the early identification of asymptomatic individuals, current literature lacks a concise and contemporary review of MCADD and its management. Nevertheless, clinicians must be proficient in the identification and management of this disease because early diagnosis can dramatically improve the prognosis for individuals with MCADD. Therefore, to achieve this goal, clinicians should obtain the most up-to-date knowledge regarding the disease's pathogenesis, diagnostic tools, and treatment options.&#x000a0;</p>

        <p>Mutations in the&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">ACADM</italic> gene on chromosome 1p31 are responsible for this disorder. These mutations result in misfolding of the translated protein, leading to decreased or absent function of the MCAD enzyme.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The <italic toggle="yes">ACADM</italic> gene spans 44&#x02009;kb of DNA and has 12 introns. Current data reports &#x0003e;400 different <italic toggle="yes">ACADM</italic> gene variations, of which 68 different variations have been classified as pathogenic, 82 variations as likely pathogenic, and around 165 variations grouped as "uncertain." Around 69% of these disease-causing variations are&#x000a0;missense mutations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>The most prevalent mutation is c.985A&#x0003e;G, resulting in&#x000a0;lysine at position 304 being exchanged for glutamate. Misfolding of the protein subsequently occurs, leading to a complete loss of function.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;This mutation is the most common mutation in symptomatic patients, seen in up to 80% of the individuals as a homozygous mutation.

        <p>The combined incidence of all FAODs ranges between 0.9 to 15.2 per 100,000 individuals. The reported incidence of&#x000a0;FAODs in European countries and the United States ranges from 6.0 to 16.4 per 100,000 individuals, primarily attributed to the high incidence of MCADD in these countries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>The&#x000a0;estimated prevalence of MCADD is 1 in 50,000 live births globally.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The prevalence of MCADD in North America and northern Europe is between 1 in every 5,000 individuals and 1 out of every 20,000 individuals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;One study&#x000a0;showed a prevalence ranging from 1 in every 10,000 to 1 out of every 27,000 persons in the countries&#x000a0;around France.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;Another study found that the carrier frequency in the general population may be as high as 1 out of every 70 individuals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;Males and females are equally affected.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r13">[13]</xref></p>
        <p>Among Asian populations, the incidence of MCADD is relatively low. The estimated incidence of this disease in Japan is 1 in 100,000 patients, and in China, around 1 out of 80,332 to 1 out of every 282,591 patients. In other countries, epidemiologic data is limited to symptomatic cases. For example, in Saudi Arabia, MCADD is reported to have a prevalence of 1 out of every 18,000, accounting only for patients with symptoms who subsequently underwent diagnostic testing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r14">[14]</xref></p>
        <p>NBS has led to an apparent increase in the incidence of this disease due to the detection of milder cases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;A large-scale prospective study of MCADD detected via NBS from the United Kingdom, where the cohort consisted of multiple different ethnicities, reported an incidence of approximately 1 in 10,000 babies.

Those diagnosed with "uncertain phenotype" were primarily of Asian heritage.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;This highlights the need for diagnostic protocols to account for the ethnic diversity of this disease to ensure those detected via NBS truly have clinically significant phenotypes.</p>

        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) is a mitochondrial flavoenzyme involved in mitochondrial fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation. MCAD catalyzes the first step in this process, which involves &#x003b1; and &#x003b2;-dehydrogenation of acyl-CoAs of medium chain lengths. It favors C6- to C12-CoA substrates and has maximum catalytic activity for C8-CoA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;The <italic toggle="yes">ACADM</italic> gene encodes MCAD. The translated polypeptide chain is imported into the mitochondria, where it undergoes&#x000a0;mature functional protein formation via cleavage of the N-terminal signal peptide. Subsequent protein folding into mature monomers of 396 residues occurs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;A normal MCAD protein is a tetramer of 4 identical subunits.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Pathogenic mutations disrupt this process, resulting in truncated proteins, altered splice sites, or misfolded MCAD proteins, rendering the enzyme inefficient or completely dysfunctional.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r4">[4]</xref></p>
        <p>Amino acid substitutions that do not significantly impact the structure of the MCAD protein still have a significant effect on enzyme activity. This manifests as low affinity for the C8-CoA substrate or as defective interaction with the electron-transferring flavoprotein of the mitochondrial matrix. The latter impairs electron transfer from MCAD to electron-transferring flavoprotein, disrupting electron flow and preventing the reoxidation of FADH2 to FAD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>
<bold>Medium-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency Pathophysiology and Biomarker Formation</bold>
</p>
        <p>MCAD dysfunction disrupts the&#x000a0;dehydrogenation step of &#x003b2;-oxidation within the mitochondria. This results in decreased production of acetyl-CoA, which is required for ketogenesis. Lack of acetyl-CoA prevents the production of ketone bodies during ketogenesis, which is essential for energy production during prolonged fasting or catabolic stress. The body attempts to compensate by maximizing gluconeogenesis; however, when glycogen stores are depleted, rapid progression to hypoketotic hypoglycemia occurs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>MCAD dysfunction also results in the accumulation of medium-length fatty acyl-CoAs in the mitochondrial matrix. They, in turn, bind to mitochondrial carnitine, resulting in the formation of acylcarnitines. These formed medium-length acylcarnitines, C6 to C12, are then eliminated from the mitochondrial matrix and released into circulation. These acylcarnitines are used as a serum biomarker to detect MCAD dysfunction, forming the basis of NBS and confirmatory diagnostic tests.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r14">[14]</xref>&#x000a0;The accumulated medium-length acyl-CoAs can also be converted to acylglycines by conjugation with glycine. Acylglycines, including hexonylglycine (C6) and suberylglycine (C8), are subsequently excreted in the urine. These urinary organic acids can be measured and are used as diagnostic biomarkers for MCADD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r15">[15]</xref>&#x000a0;MCAD deficiency results in ineffective mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Impaired mitochondrial oxygen consumption reduces skeletal muscle function, which manifests as weakness. In addition, the accumulation of medium-chain fatty acids and their derivatives results in neurologic dysfunction, which is seen as encephalopathy in these patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Causes of Phenotypic Variation</bold>
</p>
        <p>MCADD is considered a "conformational disorder;" however,&#x000a0;clinical manifestations of the disease span a broad spectrum of severity, even for those patients with the same genotype. The pathogenic phenotype of the disease appears dependent on additional extrinsic and intrinsic factors that are not clearly understood.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;One extrinsic factor to consider is riboflavin. As a flavoenzyme, MCADD depends on adequate riboflavin derivatives for its function. A clinical trial testing MCAD activity in the lymphocytes of patients with MCADD reported increased enzyme activity after riboflavin supplementation. However, the genetic profile of the test individuals was not reported in this study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r16">[16]</xref>&#x000a0;A second study&#x000a0;examined lipid and protein oxidative damage in patients with MCADD who were supplemented with carnitine or carnitine and riboflavin. They were compared to individuals who did not receive any supplementation and healthy controls. The study reported increased protein oxidative damage and altered antioxidant defense in unsupplemented and carnitine-supplemented patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r16">[16]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>These studies suggest that riboflavin supplementation has some role in stabilizing MCAD, likely via increased availability of the riboflavin derivative, flavin adenine dinucleotide.&#x000a0;Biochemical studies demonstrate that most MCAD variants have an impaired capacity to retain flavin adenine dinucleotide during their synthesis. Some variants, however, can be "structurally rescued" by riboflavin cofactor supplementation, which explains the heterogeneity of the MCADD phenotype in patients with the same genotype. Some authors postulate that riboflavin supplementation will provide structural stability in most MCAD variants.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;However, these studies were small, contained a heterogeneous group of genetic variants, and did not report long-term outcomes for patients supplemented with riboflavin. More extensive clinical studies examining the efficacy of&#x000a0;riboflavin supplementation in patients with MCADD are still needed.&#x000a0;Another factor affecting the phenotype of patients with MCADD is temperature. In biochemical studies, the MCAD tetramer formed in patients with c.985A&#x0003e;G mutation has demonstrated thermosensitivity. Thus, febrile episodes are thought to affect this protein's stability and function further in patients carrying the c.985A&#x0003e;G mutation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r5">[5]</xref></p>

<bold>Clinical Features</bold>
</p>
        <p>Individuals with MCADD are typically asymptomatic at birth. The vast majority of individuals with this disease are diagnosed via expanded NBS that has been adopted in many countries around the world.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;Individuals with severe clinical phenotypes typically present in the first 24 months of life. The onset of symptoms coincides with an intercurrent illness or an episode of prolonged fasting, as may be seen when there is a reduction in overnight feedings.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The classic presentation occurs in early childhood during an acute illness, particularly gastroenteritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r17">[17]</xref>&#x000a0;Severe hypoglycemia is a characteristic feature of this disease.&#x000a0;Other presenting symptoms include vomiting, hypoglycemia-associated seizures, lethargy, and coma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The frequency and severity of symptomatic episodes correlate poorly with the patient's genotypes. Patients with a biochemically "milder" phenotype (eg,&#x000a0; those carrying the c.199T&#x0003e;C mutation) may present with neonatal decompensation and hypoglycemia. Therefore, a clinically asymptomatic phenotype cannot be reliably predicted from a "milder" biochemical phenotype.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r18">[18]</xref></p>
        <p>Acute noninflammatory encephalopathy with hyperammonemia, liver dysfunction, and fatty infiltration of the liver may be seen in patients with hepatomegaly and acute liver failure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r19">[19]</xref>&#x000a0;These symptoms may be confused with Reye syndrome, which is characterized by acute noninflammatory encephalopathy and fatty degenerative liver failure, often following a viral illness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Symptomatic patients with MCADD can also develop muscular hypotonia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;The most significant physical examination finding is hepatomegaly, which is considered a sign of severe, life-threatening&#x000a0;illness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>Some infants may present with ventricular tachyarrhythmias induced by the accumulation of medium-chain acylcarnitines. Supraventricular arrhythmias have also been reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Sudden unexpected death in infancy is also associated with MCADD.

In addition, the rarity of this disease and the possibility of errant testing make it difficult to diagnose this condition reliably, and some unfortunate individuals may not receive treatment despite the onset of symptoms in infancy. Over time, with recurrent hypoglycemia and metabolic crises, these patients can develop epileptic encephalopathies and cognitive delay.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r21">[21]</xref>&#x000a0;Clinicians evaluating adult patients with epilepsy, especially those with refractory epileptic encephalopathies, should consider MCADD as a cause.</p>
        <p>Due to the heterogeneous group of mutations that result in this disease, some patients only have a modest reduction in MCAD activity and may not present until adulthood.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r1">[1]</xref> Adult presentation is usually accompanied by severe catabolic stress and may prove fatal.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r21">[21]</xref>&#x000a0;Adults who present with symptomatic MCADD often report ingestion&#x000a0;of alcohol and subsequent vomiting. Adults are also more likely to present with&#x000a0;cardiac symptoms than younger patients.

<bold>Medium-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency Newborn Screening</bold>
</p>
        <p>The majority of the MCADD cases today are identified through NBS. NBS for MCADD utilizes tandem mass spectrometry and measures medium-length acylcarnitines, particularly octanoyl-carnitine (C8) and decanoyl-carnitine (C10), on dried blood spot cards. A C8 level above&#x000a0;0.40&#x02009;&#x003bc;mol/L is considered abnormal and requires further testing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Octanoyl-carnitine levels on NBS may be affected by the time lapse between sample collection and testing. To mitigate the risk of false positive results, triplicate testing on dried blood spots is conducted by most NBS protocols.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The average triplicate&#x000a0;C8 value &#x02265;0.50 &#x000b5;mol/L establishes a "presumed positive" diagnosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>However, NBS using this method can also result in false negative results, especially in individuals not homozygous for the&#x000a0;c.985A&#x0003e;G mutation. Even heterozygous individuals with one&#x000a0;c.985A&#x0003e;G copy may go undetected via NBS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Higher cutoff values increase the risk of missed diagnoses.

In this cohort, 7&#x000a0;out of 13 patients were&#x000a0;homozygous for the c.985A&#x0003e;G mutation. In this multicenter retrospective study, they could not elucidate a clear cause for this trend.

<bold>Medium-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency Confirmatory Testing</bold>
</p>
        <p>Confirmatory testing involves urinary organic acid levels, repeating the acylcarnitine profile on plasma, MCAD enzyme activity levels, and genotype analysis via chromosomal testing.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Elevated acylcarnitine concentrations of C6, C8, C10, and C10:1, as well as elevated C8/C2, C8/C6, C8/C10, C8/C12, and C8/C16 ratios, are typically seen. Urinary testing will show elevated levels of&#x000a0;hexanoylglycine, isohexanoylglycine, suberylglycine, and phenylpropionylglycine.&#x000a0;Molecular testing is used to identify variants in the <italic toggle="yes">ACADM</italic> gene, but the clinical significance of a single or novel variant may be difficult to predict.&#x000a0;Enzyme activity testing is the most efficient and meaningful confirmatory test, directly assessing MCAD activity. Residual&#x000a0;enzyme function measured in this manner correlates with the&#x000a0;expected phenotype of the affected individual.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>According to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the&#x000a0;National Coordinating Center for the Regional Genetics Networks diagnostic algorithm for the diagnosis of MCADD, a positive NBS test should be followed by second-tier testing that includes a plasma acylcarnitine profile and a urinary organic acid profile. Test results that are consistent with MCADD confirm the diagnosis. Additional molecular testing for genotype analysis may be considered but is not required for the diagnosis. A second-tier testing result inconsistent with MCADD is considered a false positive, and no further testing is required.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.acmg.net/ACMG/Medical-Genetics-Practice-Resources/ACT_Sheets_and_Algorithms.aspx">[ACMG]</ext-link></p>

<bold>Serum acylcarnitine profile</bold>
</p>
        <p>The cutoff values for C8 differ between various NBS programs around the world. They are often combined with elevated secondary biomarkers, including C0, C2, C10:1, and the C8/C2 and C8/C10 ratios to improve the positive predictive value of NBS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r25">[25]</xref>&#x000a0;Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry on whole blood samples is used to repeat the acylcarnitine profile and is considered&#x000a0;the standard&#x000a0;method for diagnosing MCADD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;This method is preferred because mass spectrometry cannot differentiate&#x000a0;branched-chain C8 acylcarnitines from octanoyl-carnitines.

Chromography can distinguish octanoyl-carnitine from branched-chain C8 acylcarnitines and correct these false positive MCADD results.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r26">[26]</xref></p>
        <p>The serum acylcarnitine profiles vary significantly based on the underlying genotype of the affected individual. Compound heterozygotes carrying c.199T&#x0003e;C with c.985A&#x0003e;G or another mutation have the lowest levels of acylcarnitine markers compared to other genotypes. Individuals homozygous for the c.985A&#x0003e;G mutations were historically considered to have the highest serum acylcarnitine levels; however, recent studies report no difference in the biochemical profile of individuals homozygous for the c.985A&#x0003e;G mutation in comparison to those who are heterozygous for this mutation with an alternate second variant, other than c.199T&#x0003e;C. Similarly, other known pathogenic homozygous mutations, eg, c.799G&#x0003e;A, have similar biochemical profiles to homozygous individuals for the c.985A&#x0003e;G mutation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r18">[18]</xref>&#x000a0;According to recent data, the C8/C10 ratio is the best biochemical marker to differentiate between patients homozygous for c.985A&#x0003e;G and compound heterozygous for c.199T&#x0003e;C and c.985A&#x0003e;G or another mutation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r18">[18]</xref></p>
        <p>Initial C6 and C8 values correlate well with residual enzyme function, with the highest C6 and C8 values seen in patients with the lowest enzyme residual activity (ie, (0% to 10%).&#x000a0;The C8/C2 and C8/C10 ratios are considered most reliable in differentiating true MCADD from normal controls, often exhibiting values that are&#x000a0;10-fold higher in MCADD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Patients with residual MCAD activity &#x0003e;10% have variable acylcarnitine ratios.

        <p>
<bold>Acute Management</bold>
</p>
        <p>In symptomatic patients, reversal of catabolism and treatment of hypoglycemia are the mainstay of therapy. Simple carbohydrate administration in patients who tolerate sufficient oral intake is preferred.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Some specialists recommend a home glucose monitoring plan during acute illness or when hypoglycemic symptoms are suspected. However, subsequent management should be conducted in consultation with a metabolic specialist. Teaching caregivers about glucose requirements during acute illness and suspected decompensation is imperative. Commercially available oral rehydration solutions for diarrhea and vomiting do not contain enough glucose to meet the metabolic demands of patients with MCADD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r17">[17]</xref>&#x000a0;When administering glucose at home under these scenarios to children who no longer consume infant formula or breastmilk, concentrated glucose solutions (eg, juices or sports drinks) are preferred.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r17">[17]</xref></p>
        <p>Some experts recommend oral carbohydrate administration only if the patient's serum glucose is at or above normal.

Subsequently, 10% dextrose should be given at 1.5 times the maintenance rate to attain a glucose level of &#x02265;5&#x02009;mmol/L (90 mg/dL).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Alternatively, a bolus of 0.25 mg/kg of dextrose solution (up to 25 g) can be given to restore euglycemia. Once euglycemia is established, a maintenance infusion with 10% dextrose containing one-quarter-normal saline should be continuously administered to infants younger than 12 months of age. Older children should receive 10% dextrose solution in half-normal saline for maintenance fluids.

According to a recent review, the maximum recommended fasting period is 3 hours for neonates and infants, 4 hours for toddlers, and 5 hours for preschool children.

Early diagnosis via NBS and subsequent management by metabolic specialty centers has reduced the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease to nearly zero.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r31">[31]</xref>&#x000a0;Undiagnosed children have a mortality rate as high as&#x000a0;25% after the first symptomatic episode.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Many of the surviving individuals subsequently develop severe neurocognitive impairment after the initial presentation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>According to a recent study, the&#x000a0;prevalence of acute symptomatic MCADD episodes was reduced from 0% to 13% from a pre-NBS rate of 66% to 95%. In the same study, the mortality associated with the initial episode was reduced to 3% to 4% from a pre-NBS rate of&#x000a0;14% to 21%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r27">[27]</xref>&#x000a0;&#x000a0;In addition, this study reported a&#x000a0;decrease in the prevalence and severity of cognitive impairment in patients with MCADD from 67% to 11% after the institution of expanded NBS in their cohort. The authors note that the higher prevalence of cognitive impairment in their study, both before and after NBS, when compared to other studies, is likely due to their inclusion of borderline and mild cognitive impairment. When restricting cognitive impairment to moderate and severe intellectual disability, they report results similar to previous studies, with a 13% prevalence before and 0% after NBS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r27">[27]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>

        <title>Complications</title>
        <p>Neurocognitive impairment is the most feared complication of this disease. Neurologic sequelae with loss of developmental milestones, including aphasia and attention deficit disorder, have been reported in these patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Clinical studies demonstrate a strong correlation&#x000a0;between intellectual disability and the number and severity of symptomatic episodes of MCADD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r27">[27]</xref>&#x000a0;Preventive strategies during acute illness and avoidance of prolonged fasting are essential in decreasing the incidence of this complication. With early diagnosis and effective management, the prevalence of neurocognitive impairment in patients with MCADD reduces dramatically.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r27">[27]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Weight gain and obesity are other potential complications of MCADD. They occur due to overzealous carbohydrate administration by caregivers who fear hypoglycemia in these patients. Obesity and its associated complications, such as glucose intolerance, are a significant concern for individuals living with MCADD. Current literature includes many reports of diabetes mellitus type 2 in patients following an MCADD-specific diet.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Caregiver and eventually patient education, preferably by a metabolic dietician, regarding appropriate caloric intake is required to minimize the risk of obesity in these individuals.<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gmdi.org/">[GMDI]</ext-link>&#x000a0;Of note, the risk of obesity and weight gain is higher in individuals who are on L-carnitine supplementation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Another potential complication of MCADD is chronic renal failure. In patients with MCADD, chronic renal failure develops due to fatty infiltration&#x000a0;of the kidney with subsequent tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Regular screening for renal function and evaluation by a clinician is recommended for these patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r1">[1]</xref></p>

        <title>Deterrence and Patient Education</title>
        <p>MCADD requires patients to live a lifestyle different from their peers. The daily burden of a strict diet regime and the need for constant surveillance causes significant stress for the family. One study reported that nearly 75% of parents caring for a child with a metabolic disorder felt a substantial burden in their daily lives.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r32">[32]</xref>&#x000a0;Even without a confirmed diagnosis, parents and caregivers suffer significant anxiety surrounding MCADD. When NBS results are confirmed as falsely positive, caregivers continue to experience some level of anxiety, which manifests as higher healthcare use in the first year of life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r33">[33]</xref>&#x000a0;Patients with MCADD experience higher emergency department visits and inpatient hospitalizations from the age of 6 to 12 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r13">[13]</xref>&#x000a0;A recent national study from Canada reported that children diagnosed with MCAD deficiency use healthcare services at a significantly higher rate throughout early childhood, extending to 4 years of age, as compared to a population-based cohort of children with negative newborn screening results for MCADD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r13">[13]</xref></p>
        <p>Therefore, caregiver support and education are an essential part of MCADD treatment. Reassuring parents in times of "health" and educating them about the potential signs of metabolic decompensation must occur with every clinical encounter. Metabolic dieticians and nurses play an essential role in accomplishing this goal by providing extended sessions that supplement information provided by the metabolic physicians. Well-informed caregivers experience less anxiety about the care of their child and are more likely to ensure timely medical evaluation for children when a potential decompensation occurs.&#x000a0;In-depth and ongoing conversations with metabolic specialists and nurses help parents understand the day-to-day dietary management of this disease and emergency response strategy during an acute illness. This is especially true in the first year of life when parents report significant physical and mental burdens.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r34">[34]</xref></p>
        <p>Parents raising children with MCADD also report increased anxiety as the child grows. This is particularly true regarding transition points between fasting intervals and changes in food intake. Overcompensation due to fear of hypoglycemia often occurs. Another study reported that the day-to-day dietary management regimes followed by caregivers of children with MCADD were more stringent than those advised in the guidelines, highlighting the prevalence of the "risk-averse approach" in these parents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-24897.r34">[34]</xref>&#x000a0;Caregiver support, frequent reiteration about the plan of care, and open discussion regarding their fears must be provided to ensure optimal treatment strategies are followed and the impact of this diagnosis is minimized on the life of the child.</p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>MCADD is a rare autosomal recessive FAOD that can result in devastating consequences for the affected individual if left untreated. With early intervention, the clinical outcomes are remarkably improved. The first step in enhancing clinical outcomes for this disease is to implement expanded NBS programs worldwide.&#x000a0;Once a diagnosis is made, the care of the affected individual and clinical support for the caregivers must be provided by an interprofessional team of pediatricians, metabolic specialists, dieticians, and nurses.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>In the absence of definitive enzyme replacement or gene therapy, the management of this disease revolves around dietary changes and emergency response protocols during an acute illness. This requires caregiver education and support on an ongoing basis for the first few years of life. Metabolic dieticians are an integral part of the interprofessional team managing these patients. They can help parents understand the infants' feeding times and diet compositions to ensure prolonged fasting is avoided. As the child grows, dieticians and nurses play a crucial role in ensuring parents avoid the "risk-averse" approach and do not implement overly stringent diet regimens for the child. The metabolic specialist and pediatric clinicians must also ensure that the adolescent child with MCADD understands the dietary requirements of their disease and the risk of non-compliance.&#x000a0;Additional parent/child counseling may be required if the psychological burden of the disease begins to impact their life. Specialist metabolic nurses and counselors play a vital role in providing ongoing emotional care support to help meet these families' emotional and psychosocial needs.</p>
        <p>A recent study from the United Kingdom reported that long-term therapeutic relationships with an interprofessional team of clinicians, nurses, and dieticians are of indispensable value to individuals living with MCADD and their caregivers.&#x000a0;A collaborative approach to managing this disease utilizing an interprofessional team can improve clinical outcomes for MCADD and minimize its impact on their lives.</p>
