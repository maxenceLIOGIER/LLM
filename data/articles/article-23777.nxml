        <p>Ischial bursitis, also known as ischio-gluteal bursitis or "weaver's or tailor's bottom," is an inflammation occurring between the ischial tuberosity and the gluteus maximus muscle.&#x000a0;Ischial bursitis often results from prolonged pressure and friction on the bursa due to prolonged sitting on hard surfaces, leading&#x000a0;to discomfort.&#x000a0;The condition presents&#x000a0;with gluteal or upper posterior thigh pain after extended periods of exercise or sitting and&#x000a0;affects both genders equally.&#x000a0;Inflammatory processes cause bursae to become enlarged and painful.&#x000a0;Symptoms include pain in the gluteal region or upper posterior thigh, especially following exercise or prolonged periods of sitting.</p>
        <p>The primary physical examination findings reveal tenderness over the buttock, which is most pronounced when the patient's hip is flexed. Typically, x-rays and ultrasound serve as the initial imaging modalities, with MRI reserved for cases where diagnosis remains uncertain.&#x000a0;Ischial bursitis is generally managed conservatively to relieve symptoms, often involving rest, avoiding aggravating activities, and potentially using anti-inflammatory medications. Although conservative therapy is effective for most individuals, the duration to achieve symptomatic relief varies depending on the chosen treatment approach.&#x000a0;This activity&#x000a0;aims to provide&#x000a0;the interprofessional healthcare team with the necessary knowledge and tools to effectively and collaboratively diagnose, evaluate, and manage&#x000a0;ischial bursitis in clinical practice.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Ischial bursitis involves inflammation of the ischial bursa situated between the ischial tuberosity and the gluteus maximus muscle. The gluteus maximus covers the bursa during hip extension and in the standing position. However, the bursa and the ischial tuberosity are more directly engaged during flexion. When seated, the bursa is wedged between the bony surface of the ischial tuberosity and the external surface, making it prone to inflammation due to continuous weight-bearing pressure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Ischial&#x000a0;bursitis is also known as ischio-gluteal bursitis or "weaver's or tailor's bottom" due to the historical association of the condition with professions, where workers sat on hard surfaces for much of the day.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r3">[3]</xref></p>
        <p>The human body contains 2 types of bursae&#x02014;constant and adventitial. Constant bursae develop in utero and are present from birth, while adventitial bursae form due to frictional stress and pressure between structures, often through myxoid degeneration of fibrous tissue.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Some adventitial bursae develop due to pathologies, such as those occurring between preexisting structures and new bony growth.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r6">[6]</xref> The ischial bursa develops from the frequent rubbing of the ischial tuberosity against the gluteus maximus during movement, making it an adventitial bursa.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;This bursa reduces friction between the 2 structures during hip flexion and extension, significantly aiding the lateral slide of the gluteus maximus and surrounding fatty tissue during hip flexion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r7">[7]</xref></p>

        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>Originally named "weaver's or tailor's bottom," inflammation of the ischial bursa can result from extended periods of sitting on hard surfaces.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Factors associated with the development of ischial bursitis include occupation, history of trauma, sedentary lifestyle, duration of sitting, and obesity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Although various clinical manifestations have been reported, prolonged pressure on the ischium, particularly during sitting, remains the predominant cause.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Ischial bursitis frequently affects individuals&#x000a0;with a sedentary lifestyle.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r1">[1]</xref>.&#x000a0;Professions&#x000a0;involved with heavy vibration also have implications for developing ischial bursitis, such as using heavy-powered sewing machines, road equipment, or driving tractors. Repeated exposure to body vibration, while seated on a hard surface, can provoke irritation and inflammation of the ischiogluteal bursa, leading to bursitis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>Another etiology&#x000a0;involves the application of acute or chronic shearing force after a fall involving the ischial tuberosity, such as landing on the backside. This mechanism can also affect athletes who frequently experience "falls" onto the ischial tuberosity, such as horseback riders, canoeists, and wheelchair racers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;Additionally, even in the supine position, significant weight can be placed on the ischial tuberosity, leading to documented cases of ischial ulcers and bursitis in debilitated patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r8">[8]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>Autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and scleroderma, are recognized causes of bursitis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Patients with underlying inflammatory conditions such as gout, rheumatoid arthritis, and skin infections who develop ischial bursitis often exhibit reduced responsiveness to conservative management.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <p>Infectious and hemorrhagic bursitis primarily affects superficial bursae and is less commonly associated with deep bursitis, such as ischiogluteal bursitis. However, the proximity of the ischial bursa to the anus and urethra increases the potential for bacterial infection, especially if there is damage to the overlying skin in that area.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r10">[10]</xref></p>

        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>The incidence and prevalence of ischial bursitis are unknown, with no recent data available on this subject. While bursitis, in general, is reported equally in males and females and across all age groups, ischial bursitis is comparatively rarer and less frequently recognized.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r11">[11]</xref></p>
        <p>A retrospective study conducted in 2020 on the progression and treatment of ischial bursitis revealed no discernible difference in responsiveness to treatment based on gender, age, body mass index, occupation, trauma history, affected side, sitting lifestyle, sitting time, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein, or uric acid levels. However, the presence of inflammatory disease significantly differed between the&#x000a0;2 groups with different treatment responsiveness. In addition, the study found a&#x000a0;higher prevalence of ischial bursitis among individuals with sedentary jobs compared to those engaged in physically demanding labor. Interestingly, occurrences were also reported among patients who reported non-working status.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r1">[1]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-23777.s5" sec-type="Pathophysiology">
        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>Repetitive, chronic, and sustained injury to the bursa leads to local vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, allowing serum protein and fluid to exit the vessels and accumulate within the bursa's fluid. This material stimulates inflammatory processes, resulting in enlarged and painful bursae.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;This process is particularly prominent in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, syphilis, hypothyroidism, systemic scleroderma, and spondyloarthropathies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r10">[10]</xref></p>
        <p>Another possible presentation of ischial bursitis involves sharp, shooting radicular pain that travels down the back of the lower extremity. When an enlarged bursa extends to compress the sciatic nerve as it exits the sciatic foramen and progresses down the posterior leg, it can induce the characteristic presentation of sciatica. Additionally, compression of the nearby posterior femoral cutaneous nerve by the bursa may lead to referred pain in the posterior medial thigh, extending as far as the popliteal fossa or medial buttock.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r9">[9]</xref></p>
        <p>Crystal deposition can also cause bursitis, particularly associated with conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout, pseudogout, and spondyloarthropathies. The abnormal deposition of materials into the bursa is usually a response to a chronic inflammatory state.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r10">[10]</xref></p>

        <p>Understanding the historical context and performing a comprehensive physical examination are crucial aspects in evaluating patients suspected of ischial bursitis. Clinicians can discern key clinical clues and anatomical features essential for accurate diagnosis and effective management of this condition.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Clinical History</bold>
</p>
        <p>The most common initial presentation of ischial bursitis is buttock pain, characterized as a low-grade, pinpoint, aching sensation exacerbated by sitting or stretching the gluteus maximus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r12">[12]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r13">[13]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r14">[14]</xref>&#x000a0;Additional reported symptoms among patients include radiating upper posterior thigh pain following prolonged sitting or exercise, inguinal, trouble sleeping and reduced hip mobility secondary to pain, difficulty rising from a seated position or climbing stairs, and swelling around the ischial tuberosity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Patients often report pain during passive hip flexion and experience challenges with hip extension.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;In addition, the proximity&#x000a0;of the hamstring tendon attachment on the ischial tuberosity can cause exacerbation of pain during knee flexion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;Some patients may also&#x000a0;describe shooting pain down the back of the affected leg and posterior thigh pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r13">[13]</xref>&#x000a0;Pain usually improves with rest, alterations in activities of daily living, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r12">[12]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Physical Examination</bold>
</p>
        <p>The most notable finding on physical examination is tenderness over the buttock, which is most prominent when the patient's hip is flexed and the ischial tuberosity is palpable.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r14">[14]</xref>&#x000a0;Other potential physical findings include positive results on specific tests, including straight leg raise, flexion-adduction-internal rotation (FADIR), and Faber (Patrick).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;In some cases, a soft, well-defined, nonmobile, and slightly tender mass may be palpable in the gluteal region.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r15">[15]</xref>&#x000a0;Larger lesions may exhibit pigmented skin around the affected site.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;However, even in the absence of tenderness of the ischial tuberosity, ischial bursitis should not be ruled out, as some patients with confirmed ischial bursitis present with no specific findings on physical examination.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r1">[1]</xref></p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-23777.s7" sec-type="Evaluation">
        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>While the clinical diagnosis of ischial bursitis based on history and physical examination is adequate for some patients, those with more intricate presentations often benefit from imaging studies to confirm the diagnosis. The standard practice involves conducting an ultrasound initially, followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if the diagnosis remains ambiguous.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Radiographs are typically unremarkable except&#x000a0;in calcifying ischial bursitis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r15">[15]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r16">[16]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Ultrasound</bold>
</p>
        <p>Ultrasound findings of ischial bursitis can vary. The bursal wall often exhibits a hypoechoic appearance, although it may appear hyperechoic in certain patients. Similarly, the bursal fluid typically appears hypoechoic but can also be hyperechoic or heterogeneous. Any internal septa or mural nodules present usually appear hyperechoic. The probe is expected to compress all bursae during an ultrasound examination for optimal visualization.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r16">[16]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</bold>
</p>
        <p>MRI of ischial bursitis typically reveals a fluid-filled and distended bursa, with concurrent abnormalities in the nearby hamstring muscle complex being common. Bursitis findings include well-defined, lobulated septate lesions with a thin bursa and increased fluid intensity signals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;However, lesion enhancement on MRI can vary. MRI of ischial bursitis with T1-weighted images typically shows low-to-intermediate signal intensity, with some patients demonstrating peripheral ring-like intensity findings. T2-weighted images usually display high signal intensity, with variations in bursa homogeneity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r15">[15]</xref>&#x000a0;In addition, wavy&#x000a0;contours with increased fluid signal intensities demonstrate hamstring muscle complex abnormalities, indicating chronic microtearing of tendons.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>
<bold>Aspiration</bold>
</p>
        <p>In cases of suspected infection, aspiration of the ischial bursa may be required. Additional evaluation for suspected infection in patients with ischial bursitis should involve laboratory studies, notably a complete blood count and an ESR. If infection is confirmed, the infected bursa should be drained and cultured, followed by appropriate antibiotic therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r10">[10]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-23777.s8" sec-type="Treatment / Management">
        <title>Treatment / Management</title>
        <p>Conservative therapy proves effective in most&#x000a0;individuals with ischial bursitis. NSAIDs, lifestyle modifications, pressure-relieving pillows, and physical therapy, including extracorporeal shock wave therapy, have demonstrated efficacy in providing relief without the necessity of intrabursal injections for many patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;Primary treatment focuses on lifestyle modifications aimed at avoiding activities or habits that initially provoked the pain. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy aids in reducing adhesions in chronic bursitis by breaking down scar tissue and restoring the normal orientation of collagen fibers, thereby enhancing mobility and alleviating pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r10">[10]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;Other conservative measures include cold therapy, rest, stretching exercises, and fractional massage.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r2">[2]</xref></p>
        <p>Intrabursal injections with corticosteroids and local anesthetics are also effective for patients who experience unbearable and unrelenting pain and require further treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r14">[14]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r17">[17]</xref>&#x000a0;Some patients with nonresponsive ischial bursitis have found relief after surgical excision of the bursa.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r10">[10]</xref>&#x000a0;The inflamed tissue surrounding the bursa can also be cleared through open or laparoscopic bursectomy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r13">[13]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-23777.s9" sec-type="Differential Diagnosis">
        <title>Differential Diagnosis</title>
        <p>When ischial bursitis is considered part of a differential diagnosis and local injection with anesthetic and/or corticosteroids provides only temporary relief, it is essential to explore other potential diagnoses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r11">[11]</xref>&#x000a0;Alternative&#x000a0;causes of pain in the region of the ischial bursa and gluteal muscles include sciatica, lumbar disc degeneration, piriformis syndrome, greater trochanteric bursitis, coccydynia, sacroiliitis, and local nerve impingement.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r11">[11]</xref></p>
        <p>When manifestations of ischial bursitis involve a soft, nonmobile mass in the buttock, investigation for potential neoplastic conditions may be warranted, with MRI being the preferred imaging modality. Neoplastic lesions typically exhibit solid soft tissue components, whereas bursitis presents as cystic with a localized fluid collection and a thin wall.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r15">[15]</xref></p>
        <p>Another potential source of pain that may be misattributed to irritation of the ischial bursa is hamstring tendinopathies. The hamstring muscle complex plays a crucial role as the primary active extensor of the pelvis and flexor of the knee, rendering it highly prone to sprain and injury. Given the proximity of the conjoined tendon and semitendinosus tendons to the ischial bursa at their origins on the ischial tuberosity, distinguishing the cause of point tenderness at that site can be challenging.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Similar findings between the diagnoses include point tenderness often elicited at the ischial tuberosity, pain in the buttock or posterior thigh, discomfort when rising from a seated position, and local swelling in the affected area, depending on the severity of the bursitis. Ischial bursitis can also be concurrent with hamstring muscle complex tendinopathy and may be identified through appropriate imaging techniques.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r17">[17]</xref></p>

        <title>Prognosis</title>
        <p>The time required to achieve symptomatic relief from ischial bursitis differs among treatment modalities and can vary from days to weeks. Conservative approaches, such as lifestyle modifications and NSAIDs, may take longer to yield relief, influenced by factors such as patient adherence, pain severity, and the ability to alleviate pressure from the ischial tuberosity. On the other hand, corticosteroid and anesthetic injections usually start providing relief within minutes to days. Notably, informing&#x000a0;patients that their pain might take several days to subside is important.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r14">[14]</xref></p>
        <p>Patients with underlying inflammatory disease have shown less responsiveness to conservative measures and may necessitate more aggressive interventions for pain relief. This consideration holds significance in treatment response and patient education.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Ischial bursitis is recognized for its high recurrence rate and tendency for chronic progression, often entailing slow recovery. The high recurrence rate suggests that invasive treatment can occasionally be indicated after establishing refractory cases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r14">[14]</xref></p>

        <title>Complications</title>
        <p>While ischial bursitis itself is not typically associated with severe complications, untreated or recurrent cases can lead to chronic pain and functional limitations. Prolonged inflammation of the ischial bursa may result in fibrosis or calcification, further exacerbating discomfort and reducing mobility. Additionally, persistent bursitis can contribute to secondary complications such as muscle weakness, altered gait mechanics, and decreased quality of life.</p>
        <p>In rare cases, severe and untreated ischial bursitis may lead to secondary infections or abscess formation within the bursa, requiring prompt medical intervention. Septicemia and septic arthritis are infrequent due to the bursa's deep location. Previous studies have not conclusively established a relationship between these complications and ischial bursitis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Nevertheless, early recognition and appropriate management of ischial bursitis are crucial to mitigate potential complications and optimize patient outcomes.</p>

        <title>Consultations</title>
        <p>Consultations are pivotal in treating ischial bursitis, particularly when the diagnosis is uncertain or conservative measures are ineffective. Orthopedic specialists or sports medicine physicians can offer expertise in interpreting diagnostic imaging, administering targeted injections for pain relief, or providing surgical consultation in refractory cases.&#x000a0;Rheumatologists can assist in evaluating systemic inflammatory conditions that may mimic bursitis. Physical therapists can collaborate in designing customized rehabilitation programs to address underlying biomechanical issues contributing to bursal inflammation. By fostering interdisciplinary consultations, clinicians can access specialized knowledge and resources to optimize treatment strategies and enhance patient outcomes in managing ischial bursitis.</p>

        <title>Deterrence and Patient Education</title>
        <p>Deterrence and patient education&#x000a0;are integral in preventing and managing ischial bursitis. Educating patients on ergonomic practices, such as taking regular breaks from prolonged sitting and maintaining proper posture, can reduce the risk of bursitis development. Encouraging individuals to engage in regular stretching and strengthening exercises, particularly targeting the hip and gluteal muscles, can also help mitigate strain on the ischial bursa. Additionally, advising patients on appropriate footwear can alleviate pressure on the bursa.&#x000a0;Patients have also found relief in using lower back support, sitting on a donut cushion, and using taller chairs to allow pressure distribution over the thighs by leaning forward.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r14">[14]</xref></p>
        <p>Patients are advised to modify activities that aggravate their symptoms to prevent recurrence and alleviate discomfort. These aggravating activities may include prolonged sitting, sitting on hard surfaces, and repetitive movements of the hip or knee.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-23777.r12">[12]</xref>&#x000a0;By educating patients about risk factors, preventive measures, and early symptoms, healthcare professionals can empower them to adopt proactive behaviors that promote musculoskeletal health and reduce the likelihood of ischial bursitis occurrence or recurrence.</p>
