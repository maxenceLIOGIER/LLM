        <title>Indications</title>
        <p>The FDA recognized the combination of acetylsalicylic acid (250 mg), acetaminophen (250 mg), and caffeine (65 mg) as safe and effective in treating acute headaches, especially migraine, and was considered effective also by the American Headache Society.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17076.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17076.r2">[2]</xref> This combination is well-tolerated in episodic tension-type headaches and is considered superior to acetaminophen monotherapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17076.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;All components of this combination are considered safe during breastfeeding and can be taken orally for acute migraine attacks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17076.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17076.r5">[5]</xref></p>
        <p>This combination may have other benefits according to the components.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Caffeine</bold>
</p>
        <p>Caffeine is legal, cheap, and not regulated in almost all parts of the world; it can be found as over-the-counter (OTC) medication or in other sources such as coffee, tea, sodas, gum, and candy.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Headaches</bold>
</p>
        <p>Besides migraines and tension-type headaches, caffeine is considered effective for other types of headaches, like post-dural puncture headaches and hypnic headaches, which can present with cranial autonomic features.</p>
        <p>Clinical studies showed that caffeine citrate (intravenous [IV]) might be used alone in acute migraine attacks, but it might be inferior to magnesium sulfate (IV) in moderate-to-severe migraines. Early administration of ergotamine/caffeine compounds may also be effective.</p>
        <p>A clinical study showed that discontinuing caffeine before a migraine attack can increase the efficacy of acute treatment.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Physical performance</bold>
</p>
        <p>Caffeine improved high-intensity exercise tolerance&#x000a0;with less fatigue but no change in power. Therefore, athletes use it as an ergogenic aid to increase physical performance.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Pain</bold>
</p>
        <p>Adding&#x000a0;100 mg or more&#x000a0;caffeine to a standard dose of commonly used analgesics provides a small but significant increase in pain relief in postoperative procedures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17076.r6">[6]</xref>. Adding 100 mg of caffeine to 400 mg of ibuprofen demonstrated more efficacy than ibuprofen alone&#x000a0;following dental extraction. A study also showed that introducing caffeine after general anesthesia enhanced the recovery from the anesthesia, but further studies are needed.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Premature babies</bold>
</p>
        <p>Caffeine has a significant role in treating and preventing further damage in premature babies younger than 32 weeks and with&#x000a0;very&#x000a0;low birth weight (500 to 1250 g).&#x000a0;Caffeine is used as therapy for apnea of prematurity, decreases the risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and decreases brain damage in hypoxic brain injury. Furthermore,&#x000a0;the drug has a role in reducing the rate of patent ductus arteriosus requiring treatment and decreases&#x000a0;the likelihood of discharging home with oxygen.&#x000a0;Caffeine can help shorten the time of mechanical ventilation in premature babies who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, which may reduce the risk of lung injury. Other clinical studies showed decreases in bilirubin neurotoxicity after introducing caffeine to rats.</p>
        <p>Habitual caffeine consumption may demonstrate benefits in other fields, such as neurodegenerative disorders, dementia in Alzheimer disease, and Parkinson disease, and improve neurobehavioral performance without changing the subjective assessment of sleepiness and fatigue.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Acetaminophen</bold>
</p>
        <p>Acetaminophen, or paracetamol, is the most commonly used analgesic and antipyretic drug worldwide.&#x000a0;The drug may be used without a prescription and is the drug of choice in patients who cannot have treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs&#x000a0;(NSAIDs) as well as those patients with bronchial asthma, peptic ulcer disease, hemophilia, salicylate-sensitized people, children under 12 years of age, and pregnant or breastfeeding women.</p>
        <p>Acetaminophen is used alone or combined with other medications to treat acute primary headaches; it is combined with aspirin and caffeine for migraine, tension-type headaches, and tramadol for cluster headaches.</p>

<bold>Acetylsalicylic Acid</bold>
</p>
        <p>Acetylsalicylic Acid, aspirin, is metabolized into salicylic acid (SA) and used at doses of less than or equal to 325 mg per day to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, whereas it is used at higher doses (500 to 1000 mg as a single dose and 3000 to 4000 mg per day) to reduce pain, fever, and inflammation.</p>
        <p>Used alone or combined with other drugs, aspirin 500 to 1000 mg is a first-line therapy for moderate to severe primary headaches.&#x000a0;ASA may be combined with ibuprofen 400 mg for a tension-type headache or metoclopramide 10 mg for acute migraines. It may also be used as&#x000a0;a prophylactic treatment of migraine with aura.</p>
        <p>Intravenous aspirin administration for inpatient management of a headache is considered safe, effective, and useful, and in migraine headaches, it is considered superior to sumatriptan with minor possible adverse effects.</p>
        <p>Acetylsalicylic acid is contraindicated in children under the age of 12 because of the risk of Reye syndrome, except in Kawasaki disease, when used with intravenous immunoglobulin.</p>
        <p>Aspirin is used as an antiplatelet drug at lower doses (75 to 325 mg) to reduce cardiovascular events in high-risk patients.</p>
        <p>The drug&#x000a0;has anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, aspirin can be used in an exercise-induced inflammatory response, chronic pain, or inflammation-induced cancers. Other studies showed an association between the use of aspirin with a preventive and therapeutic role in the following cancers:</p>

        <p>
<bold>Caffeine</bold>
</p>
        <p>Caffeine has anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticholinesterase, and anti-TLR-4 properties. Studies on rats showed that these properties play an essential role in sleep deprivation-induced inflammatory response and anxious behavior.</p>
        <p>Caffeine is a methylxanthine that antagonizes adenosine receptors (eg, A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) non-selectively. These receptors appear in high concentrations in the nucleus accumbens, which modulates behavioral activation and effort-based-decision making. This effect may modulate the work effort of those who are not intrinsically motivated, although there are individual differences in the energizing effects of caffeine.</p>
        <p>A clinical study showed that antagonizing the adenosine receptor (A2A) can reverse the behavioral effect of dopamine (D2) antagonists (eg, haloperidol). Another clinical study showed&#x000a0;mild, partial reversal effects on the D1 antagonist. These findings can have implications for treating psychiatric symptoms (psychomotor slowing and fatigue) that are observable in depressed patients.</p>
        <p>Continued caffeine consumption does not lead to consistent changes in the functional availability of cerebral adenosine receptor A1.</p>
        <p>Caffeine reduces the cerebral blood flow in the brain but with an increase in brain entropy, which reflects the information processing capacity, especially in the&#x000a0;lateral prefrontal cortex.&#x000a0;Caffeine also increases the oxygen extraction fraction as compensation for reducing cerebral blood flow, and no significant changes occur in the whole brain's cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen or electrical brain activity. Researchers noticed variations in the change of cerebral blood flow between the regions of the brain. The decrease in cerebral blood flow was smaller in the posterior cingulate cortex and superior temporal region,&#x000a0;whereas it was more significant in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and medial frontal cortex.</p>
        <p>One may conclude that caffeine's effect on vasculature may be region-specific and can result from the spatial distribution of the adenosine receptors. Another study showed that caffeine might stimulate ketone production as an alternative fuel for the brain during decreased concentrations of glucose (aging or Alzheimer disease), but the ketogenic effect or the effect on medium-chain triglycerides is still unknown. Caffeine can affect the quality of sleep and increase performance in sleep deprivation. EEG showed that it reduces slow-wave sleep and slow-wave activities, increasing stage-1 wakefulness and arousal.</p>
        <p>Caffeine down-regulates the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and phosphorylated and total CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein). This association plays a vital role in learning and memory. A clinical study on mice showed that caffeine reduces amyloid-beta concentrations in the brain, which accumulate&#x000a0;during Alzheimer disease.</p>
        <p>Caffeine metabolism is affected by many factors (age, gender, hormones, liver disease, obesity, smoking, and diet). CYP1A2 isoform of cytochrome P450 mainly metabolizes&#x000a0;the drug. Polymorphism at the level of this isoform explains the variability of pharmacokinetics among individuals.&#x000a0;Research has located several loci involved in caffeine consumption, which affect sleep, anxiety, and neurodegenerative/psychiatric disorders.</p>
        <p>Caffeine as therapy can be taken intravenously (IV) or orally.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Acetaminophen</bold>
</p>
        <p>Acetaminophen inhibits central and may weakly inhibit peripheral cyclooxygenase (COX), strongly inhibits prostacyclin synthesis, and increases nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. However, NO synthesis is not affected at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. There is experimental evidence that acetaminophen inhibits cyclooxygenase-3 in the CNS, accounting for its analgesic and antipyretic effects while explaining its lack of anti-inflammatory effects in the periphery.</p>
        <p>A study showed that caffeine induces faster absorption and prolonged half-life of acetaminophen, and this effect is profound in hepatic patients.</p>
        <p>At the genetic level, acetaminophen increases the expression of the gene GRIN2C, which encodes the N-methyl-D-aspartate&#x000a0;receptor&#x000a0;2C subunit.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Aspirin</bold>
</p>
        <p>Aspirin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 and 2 (COX-1 and COX-2), thus suppressing prostaglandin E2.&#x000a0;Aspirin stimulates the regulatory braking signals such as lipoxin, resulting in decreased concentrations of:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>C-reactive protein</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Tumor necrosis factor-alpha</p>

            <p>IL-6</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>However, the concentrations of regulatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) will not decrease; TGF-beta is a possible target for acetylsalicylic acid.</p>
        <p>Chronic, high-dose aspirin intake inhibited the terminal differentiation of dendritic cells. This inhibition is observable by the suppressed levels of CD83 and the secreted p40 unit of IL-12, which are markers of mature dendritic cells.</p>
        <p>Analgesic effects of aspirin were found in primary and secondary somatosensory cortices and anterior parts of the anterior cingulate cortex, whereas the antihyperalgesic effects mainly appeared in the primary somatosensory area, parietal association cortices and anterior portions of the anterior cingulate cortex. Aspirin attenuated glutamate, which may play&#x000a0;a role in its neuroprotective effect.</p>
        <p>Aspirin's protective effects on tumors and inflammation&#x000a0;may be demonstrated by inhibiting mTOR, which leads to an inhibitory effect on tumor angiogenesis. Also,&#x000a0;the drug is biotransformed into salicylic acid, which binds to human high mobility group box1 (HMGB1), which is an inflammatory molecule.</p>

        <title>Administration</title>
        <p>Acetaminophen/aspirin/caffeine is available in an oral tablet of&#x000a0;250 mg/250 mg/65 mg, respectively. This dose form is available OTC. The typical dosage is 2 tablets&#x000a0;orally once every 24 hours&#x000a0;as needed for migraine headaches.&#x000a0;Do not exceed 1 g/h or 4g/day acetaminophen.</p>

<bold>Special Populations</bold>
</p>
        <p><bold>Renal impairment:&#x000a0;</bold>For patients with CrCl &#x0003c;10, consider alternatives, although dose adjustment is not possible with the fixed-dose combination.</p>
        <p><bold>Hepatic impairment:&#x000a0;</bold>Consider decreasing the dose based on acetaminophen.</p>
        <p><bold>Pregnancy considerations:&#x000a0;</bold>Acetaminophen is the pain reliever and antipyretic of choice during pregnancy. No known risk of fetal harm is known. Aspirin may be used in low doses during pregnancy. Weigh the risks and benefits of full-dose aspirin at 20 to 29 weeks gestation and avoid full-dose aspirin after 30 weeks gestation. Caffeine may be used during pregnancy with no known risk&#x000a0;of fetal harm. A possible risk to the fetus has been observed at dosages greater than 200 mg daily.</p>
        <p><bold>Breastfeeding considerations:&#x000a0;</bold>Acetaminophen is a pain reliever and antipyretic of choice while breastfeeding. No known risk of fetal harm based on human data is known. Aspirin may be used in low doses&#x000a0;during pregnancy. Avoid full-dose aspirin when breastfeeding. Caffeine may be consumed when breastfeeding. Monitor infants&#x000a0;during high-dose or long-term use.</p>
        <p><bold>Pediatric considerations:&#x000a0;</bold>This medication is not recommended for children&#x000a0;younger than 12.</p>
        <p><bold>Older patients:&#x000a0;</bold>Adjust dosage per hepatic and renal parameters if necessary.</p>

<bold>Caffeine</bold>
</p>
        <p>A double-blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled trial in 13 academic hospitals&#x000a0;in&#x000a0;4 countries showed that caffeine did not affect general intelligence, attention, and behavior and was safe for use.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17076.r9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17076.r10">[10]</xref></p>
        <p>As a treatment for acute primary headaches, patients may develop several adverse effects:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Nervousness</p>
          </list-item>

          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>Nervousness was the most frequently reported adverse effect.</p>
        <p>Although caffeine is an acute treatment for migraine pain, it is a known trigger for migraines. One clinical study on mice showed that acute and chronic effects of caffeine could potentially be an underlying reason for the aura of a migraine, and another study showed that patients who take aspirin and caffeine experience headaches more than patients who take aspirin only.</p>
        <p>Studies showed that caffeine use has a neutral effect on hypertension and heart failure, but further studies are needed to determine the association with arrhythmias.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Sleep and Habitual Use</bold>
</p>
        <p>Habitual daily use of caffeine may cause other adverse effects, such as&#x000a0;the following:</p>

        <p>Acetaminophen should be used cautiously and in reduced doses (2 to 3 grams per day) in patients with hepatic impairment for a period not exceeding a few days.</p>
        <p>Patients with chronic hepatitis C infection are predisposed to developing liver failure after acetaminophen overdose. Also, acetaminophen showed a dose-dependent enhancement of the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, although studies in healthy volunteers have shown no such effect.&#x000a0;Competition for CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 metabolic activity, but conditions such as aging and tissue hypoxia alter the action of these pathways in human studies. Acetaminophen still is the analgesic and antipyretic of choice in patients&#x000a0;taking warfarin. Still, patients should avoid excessive amounts and prolonged administration (greater than 1.3 grams daily for&#x000a0;2 weeks).</p>

<bold>Caffeine</bold>
</p>
        <p>Very high doses of caffeine can cause various supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Therefore, caffeine&#x000a0;dosing should be&#x000a0;optimized in patients who experience heart disease, but this is a prudent&#x000a0;measure even in other patients.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Acetaminophen</bold>
</p>
        <p>In many countries, acetaminophen overdose is the leading cause of drug-induced acute liver failure. Liver intoxication initiates by metabolizing acetaminophen to N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), depleting cellular glutathione and forming protein adducts on mitochondrial proteins; this leads to the activation of the apoptosis cascade. Intoxication differs between the individuals according to some factors, specifically, decreased P53 that shows a protective role in regulating the metabolism of acetaminophen, increased protein kinase (cAMP-dependent) inhibitor alpha, deficiency of interleukin 15, and deficiency of prostaglandin E2.</p>
        <p>Acetaminophen stimulates Kupffer cells to form peroxynitrite, which is a potent oxidant and leads to the accumulation of neutrophils.</p>
        <p>Lower acetaminophen (150 mg/kg) causes reversible mitochondrial dysfunction and fat droplet formation in hepatocytes without ALT release or necrosis.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Antidote</bold>
</p>
        <p>Acetylcysteine is known as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species.&#x000a0;This drug can be used with no contraindications, orally within 8 to 10 hours of the overdose, and intravenously in patients more than 10 hours after the overdose or in patients with conditions preventing taking it orally. Acetylcysteine has a limited therapeutic window. There is a need to develop interventions for late-presenting patients.</p>
        <p>Up to 10% of patients with acetaminophen overdose may experience acute kidney injury; some patients may rarely present with acute pancreatitis and hepatic failure.</p>

        <p>Acute ingestion of more than 150 mg/kg or 6.5 g of aspirin or ingestion of&#x000a0;more than a lick or taste of wintergreen (98% methyl salicylate) by children younger than&#x000a0;age 6 or 4 mL of oil of wintergreen by patients aged 6&#x000a0;or older, warrants referral to an emergency department.</p>

        <p>Patients with such symptoms and signs should receive a referral to the emergency department. Infants initially diagnosed with neonatal sepsis due to metabolic acidosis, tachypnea, and hypoglycemia who failed to respond to therapy should undergo further investigation to exclude salicylate toxicity, especially in infants whose mothers took aspirin throughout the pregnancy.</p>
        <p>Laboratory results will show respiratory alkalosis, metabolic acidosis, and elevated salicylate concentration. Patients may develop renal tubular acidosis during treatment, which causes normal anion gap metabolic acidosis.</p>

        <p>Salicylate toxicity may be acquired in multiple ways: oral route, intravenously, or excessive application of topical agents. Methyl salicylate is absorbable through intact skin, where the scrotal skin can have up to 40-fold greater absorption compared to dermal regions.</p>
        <p>Patients with salicylate toxicity should not have vomiting induced for acute ingestion of toxic doses. Out-of-hospital administration of activated charcoal should merit consideration in the following conditions:</p>

        <p>For asymptomatic patients with dermal exposures to methylsalicylate of salicylic acid, the skin should be washed with soap and water. The patient can undergo observation at home for the development of symptoms.</p>
        <p>For chronic topical poisoning, modern high-flux, intermittent hemodialysis is an effective method for removing salicylates.</p>
        <p>For ocular exposure, the affected eye requires irrigation with room-temperature tap water for 15 minutes and referral for an ophthalmological examination if the patient has pain, decreased visual acuity, or persistent irritation.</p>
        <p>For oral or intravenous ingestion, fluid resuscitation and sodium bicarbonate infusion should be initiated with an administration of glucose; a patient with severe toxicity should undergo hemodialysis, and mechanical ventilation is recommended.</p>

        <p>All healthcare professionals should be aware of the adverse effects of the combination of acetylsalicylic acid (250 mg),&#x000a0; acetaminophen (250 mg), and caffeine (65 mg). While the treatment is effective for migraine&#x000a0;and tension headaches, the patient must understand the importance of medication adherence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17076.r12">[12]</xref> Each visit should&#x000a0;include a query regarding the patient's adverse effects. Finally, to prevent drug toxicity, the medication must be stored away from the reach of children.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17076.r13">[13]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17076.r14">[14]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-17076.r15">[15]</xref></p>
        <p>The use of this combination medication requires an interprofessional team approach. Regardless of discipline, the prescriber should work with the pharmacist to rule out drug interactions and account for all possible sources of acetaminophen and NSAIDs to prevent toxicity. Nurses should be familiar with the adverse events of all&#x000a0;3 components and report any concerns observed to the prescriber. This strategy relies on open communication channels between the various clinical disciplines so all interprofessional team members operate from the same data, and appropriate action can be taken in the patient's case if necessary. Shared decision-making is crucial to effective interprofessional teamwork. This coordinated interprofessional methodology optimizes therapeutic results while limiting adverse effects and interactions, resulting in better patient outcomes.</p>
