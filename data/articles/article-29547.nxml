        <p>Stridor is an abnormal, high-pitched respiratory sound produced by irregular airflow in a narrowed airway during the&#x000a0;inspiration&#x000a0;phase. Stridor can result from various congenital and acquired conditions. Diagnosis for this condition is aided by considering the patient's age and the onset of symptoms. In cases of diagnostic uncertainty, healthcare professionals may perform x-rays or bronchoscopy on patients to determine the etiology of stridor&#x02014;a manifestation of an underlying pathology that requires a comprehensive patient history and physical examination. In young children and infants, even minor inflammation can lead to significant and rapid airway obstruction. Therefore, healthcare professionals must have a thorough understanding of the underlying causes of stridor and be highly skilled in evaluating and addressing compromised airways while comprehending the root causes of the condition. This topic delves into the pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, and clinical management of stridor while also highlighting the integral role of the interprofessional healthcare team in caring for patients with this condition.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Stridor is an abnormal, high-pitched respiratory sound produced by irregular airflow in a narrowed airway. This condition&#x000a0;indicates significant upper airway obstruction&#x000a0;and is usually most prominent&#x000a0;during the inspiration phase. Identifying the underlying disease process is crucial in managing stridor symptoms.&#x000a0;The medical history, age, and symptom acuity of a child aid in distinguishing the underlying cause of the condition.</p>
        <p>Congenital malformations, life-threatening obstructions, or acute infections can cause stridor. In cases of diagnostic uncertainty, healthcare professionals may perform x-rays or bronchoscopy on patients to determine the etiology of stridor.&#x000a0;In young children and infants, even minor inflammation can lead to significant and rapid airway obstruction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29547.r1">[1]</xref> The timing of stridor during the respiratory cycle provides valuable insights into the level of obstruction. The inspiratory&#x000a0;stridor indicates a laryngeal obstruction, whereas the expiratory stridor suggests a tracheobronchial obstruction. Biphasic stridor is commonly associated with subglottic or glottic anomalies. This topic addresses both acquired and congenital causes of stridor and the evaluation and treatment of stridor in children.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-29547.s3" sec-type="Etiology">
        <title>Etiology</title>
        <p>Stridor is a manifestation of an underlying pathology and may result from acute or chronic factors. Although the symptoms associated with acute causes of stridor typically emerge within minutes to hours, they can also develop over days. Patients with acute stridor are at risk&#x000a0;of experiencing&#x000a0;rapid progression of their symptoms. In contrast, chronic stridor is caused by a congenital or acquired abnormality, and it may persist for weeks. Although chronic stridor generally becomes apparent within the first few weeks of life, some cases may manifest later in childhood.</p>
        <p>Laryngotracheitis, commonly known as croup, is the primary cause of stridor in infants and children, often attributed to the parainfluenza virus. Laryngomalacia, characterized by the collapse of supraglottic structures during inspiration, is the leading cause of extrathoracic airway obstruction in infants.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29547.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Additional bacterial infectious causes of stridor include <italic toggle="yes">Neisseria meningitidis, </italic><italic toggle="yes">Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus&#x000a0;aureus,&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus pneumoniae,&#x000a0;</italic><italic toggle="yes">S pyogenes,</italic></italic>&#x000a0;and other<italic toggle="yes"> streptococci.&#x000a0;</italic>Viral pathogens include influenza A and B, herpes simplex virus,&#x000a0;Epstein-Barr virus, HIV, and&#x000a0;SARS-CoV-2. These pathogens can lead to epiglottitis, croup, peritonsillar abscesses, and retropharyngeal abscesses.</p>
        <p><bold>Acute Causes of Stridor</bold>&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>Acute causes of stridor encompass conditions such as croup, bacterial tracheitis, epiglottitis, retropharyngeal abscess, foreign body aspiration, peritonsillar abscess, airway burns, anaphylaxis, therapeutic hypothermia, and post-extubation complications.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Chronic Causes of Stridor</bold>
</p>
        <p>Chronic causes of stridor include conditions such as craniofacial anomalies like Pierre Robin or Apert syndromes, macroglossia-inducing disorders, laryngomalacia, laryngeal webs, laryngeal cysts, laryngeal clefts, subglottic stenosis, vocal cord paralysis, tracheal stenosis, tracheomalacia, vascular ring, bronchogenic cysts, infantile hemangiomas, tumors, respiratory papillomatosis, and hypocalcemic laryngeal spasm.</p>
        <p>Stertor, which manifests as snoring during sleep, results from airway constriction in the nasal, nasopharyngeal, or oropharyngeal regions. Stertor can be distinguished from stridor due to its characteristic low-pitched sound.</p>

      <sec id="article-29547.s4" sec-type="Epidemiology">
        <title>Epidemiology</title>
        <p>The epidemiology of stridor varies based on the underlying cause. Stridor is a more frequent presentation among pediatric patients than in adults. Croup reaches its highest incidence between 6 and 36 months, leading to 350,000 to 400,000 croup-related emergency department visits annually. Croup affects 2% to 6% of infants and children annually, with a slightly higher prevalence among males than females, at a ratio of 1.4:1.</p>
        <p>Foreign body aspiration accounts for more than 17,000 emergency department visits per year in the United States, with most cases occurring in children younger than&#x000a0;3.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29547.r3">[3]</xref></p>

      <sec id="article-29547.s5" sec-type="Pathophysiology">
        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>When trying to identify the cause of stridor, it is important to determine whether the location of the issue is from within the chest cavity (intrathoracic) or from outside of it (extrathoracic).</p>
        <p>
<bold>Extrathoracic</bold>
</p>
        <p>The supraglottic, glottic, and subglottic areas fall within the extrathoracic category. Rapid narrowing in the supraglottic areas can occur because of the absence of cartilage. In infants, the subglottic region is a critical area where even minimal airway narrowing can significantly elevate airway resistance. An obstruction in the extrathoracic region is responsible for causing inspiratory stridor. This occurs because, during inspiration, the intratracheal pressure falls below atmospheric pressure, resulting in airway collapse. Common causes of stridor in the extrathoracic region are laryngomalacia, croup, a retropharyngeal abscess, epiglottitis, and craniofacial malformations.</p>
        <p>
<bold>Intrathoracic</bold>
</p>
        <p>The intrathoracic region encompasses the tracheal section located within the thoracic cavity and the mainstem bronchi. Congenital disorders are the common causes of airway narrowing in this area. An obstruction within the intrathoracic region results in an expiratory stridor. This occurs because, during expiration, elevated pleural pressure compresses the airway, leading to a reduction in airway size at the site of the intrathoracic obstruction.</p>
        <p>Children who exhibit narrowing at the glottis level may experience inspiratory or biphasic stridor because this airway segment remains virtually unchanged during respiration. This can occur in cases involving foreign bodies and subglottic stenosis.</p>

<bold>Patient History</bold>

        <p>The patient's medical history plays a pivotal role in guiding clinical decision-making. Factors such as age, acuity of symptoms, symptom severity, and any history of chronic stridor are instrumental in guiding the differential diagnosis.</p>

          </list-item>

        <p>
<bold>Physical Examination</bold>
</p>
        <p><bold>General:&#x000a0;</bold>Comparing a patient's height and weight to their previous values is essential. Acute weight loss may indicate an acute issue, while failure to thrive could imply a chronic cause of stridor.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p><bold>Skin:</bold> Healthcare providers should assess patients for any hives or swelling of the neck or soft tissues in the oropharynx. Furthermore, they should inspect the skin and nails of patients for signs of hemangiomas, caf&#x000e9; au lait spots, lymphadenopathy, and clubbing. These observations suggest a hemangioma in the airway, neurofibromas, infection or tumor, and congenital heart disease, respectively.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p><bold>Otolaryngology:</bold>&#x000a0;Healthcare providers should assess&#x000a0;the tongue size and pharynx of patients for signs of edema or a peritonsillar abscess. They should exercise caution when examining the oropharynx of a patient suspected of having epiglottitis and conduct the assessment in a controlled setting, such as the operating room.</p>
        <p><bold>Respiratory:</bold> Healthcare providers&#x000a0;should assess the rate and depth of breathing and auscultate for both inspiratory and expiratory stridor. In addition, it is recommended to auscultate over the anterior neck for the best detection of stridor.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29547.r4">[4]</xref> In a child, the preference to sit up or assume a "tripod" position raises suspicion for epiglottitis. However, this positioning can also be observed in the presence of any significant airway obstruction. Infants, on the other hand, may extend their necks backward.&#x000a0;</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="article-29547.s7" sec-type="Evaluation">
        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>The initial evaluation should begin with a rapid assessment of the patient's airway and respiratory effort to determine the necessity for immediate intervention. The primary objective is to ensure the patient's airway is unobstructed and adequately oxygenated. Healthcare providers should assess the patient's breathing rate and depth while also checking for signs of hypoxia, cyanosis, or any indications of respiratory fatigue.</p>
        <p>Additional testing, including imaging, radiography, and endoscopy, may be performed for stable patients presenting with stridor. Laboratory tests, such as a complete blood cell count (CBC) with a differential, may be ordered if there is suspicion of an infectious source. The differential diagnosis can aid in distinguishing between viral and bacterial causes. In cases of classic croup presentation, a CBC is generally unnecessary. However, a rapid viral panel may be warranted to assess for parainfluenza viruses in pediatric patients necessitating hospitalization.</p>
        <p>Radiography, which may include a lateral plain film, can be performed to evaluate the size of the retropharyngeal space. A widened space on the imaging may be indicative of a retropharyngeal abscess. The mnemonic "6 at C2, and 22 at C6" serves as a helpful reminder that, in adults, the normal retropharyngeal space should not exceed 6 mm at the level of C2 and should stay below 22 mm at the level of C6. For children, the retropharyngeal space at C6 should be limited to 14 mm or less. This imaging can also help visualize an enlarged epiglottis.</p>
        <p>The "steeple sign," attributed to an edematous subglottic arch, is the classic radiographic sign observed on an anteroposterior view of the neck in children with croup. Although approximately 70% of children with epiglottitis may have normal neck x-rays, a defining feature of epiglottitis is the presence of a "thumb sign" resulting from an enlarged epiglottis.</p>
        <p>A chest radiograph can detect mediastinal masses, lymphadenopathy, or foreign bodies.&#x000a0;Notably,&#x000a0;a negative chest radiograph does not necessarily rule out the possibility of a foreign body.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29547.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Before conducting any radiological studies, it is essential to assess the child for signs of impending respiratory failure. If there are concerns, it is imperative to have personnel trained in airway management accompany the child to the radiology department.</p>
        <p>In cases of diagnostic uncertainty in a stable patient with stridor, computed tomography (CT) is a viable alternative. CT scans of the chest and neck can reveal potential sources of infection, such as cellulitis, stenotic lesions, and foreign bodies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a valuable tool for distinguishing tracheal stenosis in pediatric patients.</p>
        <p>Laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy can help visualize the airways to establish a definitive diagnosis. Rigid bronchoscopy is particularly useful for identifying and extracting foreign bodies. In cases where the patient presents as critically ill, or when epiglottitis or bacterial tracheitis is suspected as the cause of stridor, endotracheal intubation should be promptly considered.</p>

        <p>Stridor&#x000a0;is an abnormal, high-pitched respiratory sound produced by irregular airflow in a narrowed airway during the&#x000a0;inspiration&#x000a0;phase. A stridor&#x000a0;is an indicator of partial obstruction in the upper airways. Multiple factors can contribute to the development of stridor. Some frequently encountered causes include:</p>

        <p>When a child presents with stridor, various tests may be required. By conducting x-rays and CT scans of the chest and neck,&#x000a0;healthcare professionals&#x000a0;can&#x000a0;gather insights into potential infections, foreign bodies, and congenital abnormalities. Laryngoscopy allows visualization of the back of the throat, whereas bronchoscopy examines the throat, trachea, and bronchi or the tubes leading into the lungs.</p>
        <p>The treatment for stridor is contingent on its underlying cause. If left untreated, a&#x000a0;child might experience complete airway obstruction. Management of the condition may involve antibiotics, respiratory therapies, or steroids for certain conditions, whereas others may necessitate surgical intervention.</p>

        <title>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes </title>
        <p>Individuals with stridor are at a heightened risk of developing respiratory failure. Due to the broad differential and potentially life-threatening consequences, early identification and management of the underlying cause of the condition are essential for enhancing patient care and reducing morbidity and mortality. Effective evaluation and management of stridor require the collaboration of a diverse team of healthcare professionals. This medical team should consist of primary care physicians and specialists in pulmonary, gastroenterology, cardiology, emergency medicine, and infectious disease. In addition, healthcare professionals in radiology, nursing, and respiratory therapy should possess the necessary knowledge and skills to support the team.</p>
        <p>Clinicians must be competent to evaluate respiratory status and manage a compromised airway. When a patient arrives in a critical condition with stridor, healthcare professionals should swiftly identify signs of impending deterioration and gather the appropriate resources. Subsequently, treatment should be focused on addressing the underlying cause and the associated disease process.&#x000a0;</p>
        <p>A&#x000a0;patient's medical history and physical examination, combined with severity scores and treatment algorithms, significantly contribute to enhanced diagnostic precision and favorable patient outcomes. For instance, in the case of croup, numerous clinical trials have shown that proper management can be determined based on the&#x000a0;patient's clinical presentation and severity scores. Clinical severity scores and related treatment algorithms resulted in a reduction in endotracheal intubations and shorter hospital stays.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-29547.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;Enhancing the competence and expertise of healthcare professionals in understanding the underlying causes of stridor, adeptly assessing a patient's degree of respiratory distress, and effectively managing stridor will ultimately lead to improved patient outcomes and a reduction in morbidity and mortality.</p>
