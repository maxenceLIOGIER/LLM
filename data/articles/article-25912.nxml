        <p>Nociception provides a means of neural feedback that allows the central nervous system (CNS) to detect and avoid noxious and potentially damaging stimuli in both active and passive settings.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r6">[6]</xref> The sensation of pain divides into four large types: acute pain, nociceptive pain, chronic pain, and neuropathic pain. This article will consider the categories of acute and nociceptive pain together. Acute noxious stimuli (e.g., heat, cold, mechanical force, or chemical stimulation) trigger nociceptors. Acute pain becomes inflammatory pain when the noxious stimulus persists long enough to allow nociceptive neurons to release their pro-inflammatory markers and sensitize or activate responsive cells in their local environment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Nociceptive pain arises from tissues damaged by physical or chemical agents such as trauma, surgery, or chemical burns, while neuropathic pain arises from diseases or damage mediated directly to sensory nerves, such as diabetic neuropathy, shingles, or postherpetic neuralgia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r8">[8]</xref>&#x000a0;Differentiating acute and nociceptive pain from neuropathic pain aids in understanding the broader study of pain; however, neuropathic pain will not be evaluated further in this article.</p>
        <p>Regarding active settings, stimulated nociceptive neurons convey high-threshold noxious stimuli to the CNS. The nociceptive signal may either get redirected immediately in a spinal reflex loop, producing a rapid and reflexive withdrawal or transported to the areas of the brain responsible for integrating the information with higher-ordered sensations such as pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r2">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r6">[6]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;In addition to spinal afferent transmission to the CNS, nociceptive neurons are also capable of responding to noxious stimuli by secreting chemical signals from their peripheral nerve endings.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r2">[2]</xref>&#x000a0;Local actions on nearby neuronal and non-neural cells undergo mediation through the release of vesicles containing preformed pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r8">[8]</xref></p>
        <p>Depending on the specific monomodal sensitivity of a previously inactive nociceptor, specific noxious stimuli are detected by expressed receptors that open their cation channels in response to activation. The open cation channels on the nociceptive neurons depolarize the nociceptor, inducing vesicle fusion and cytokine release. The cytokines are pro-inflammatory, and once released, they elicit and propagate a matched release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from local epithelial, endothelial, and lymphoid cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The responding cells may then migrate or otherwise disseminate their pro-inflammatory signals that go on to sensitize or activate surrounding nociceptors originally outside of the primary nociceptive field.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>The spread of nociceptor-induced inflammation occurring over an area greater than that of the original nociceptor(s) involved is referred to as neuroinflammation. The propagation from nociceptive neurons to the surrounding cells, which may in-turn sensitize nearby nociceptive neurons, is why neuroinflammation is considered to be a self-reinforcing phenomenon.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;Not only do the released pro-inflammatory molecules activate local inflammatory cells, but they are also capable of directly activating other nociceptive nerve endings because almost all nociceptive nerve endings possess receptors for all of the pro-inflammatory markers they are capable of releasing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;The pro-inflammatory molecules released from a directly stimulated nociceptive neuron are capable of binding to and activating a local nociceptive neuron entirely unaffected by the original stimulus. As with direct activation, the pro-inflammatory molecules bind the receptors on nociceptive nerve endings and depolarize the cell. Depolarization induces mitogen and protein activated kinases that phosphorylate other transducer proteins, such as TRPV1. This will activate and reinforce the depolarization, which, if of sufficient amplitude, will recruit voltage-gated sodium channels and truly depolarize the nerve fiber.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r7">[7]</xref></p>
        <p>Nociceptive signals cease with the termination of the stimulus, dephosphorylation, and suppression of the receptor, or once the influx of calcium through the open membrane proteins induces the nociceptive nerve ending to collapse and become refractory to restimulation in either neuronal or secretory mechanisms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;The collapse of the nociceptor following stimulation supports the finding that noxious stimuli quickly adjust, and their conscious perception abates quickly once their peripheral activity ceases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>There is also a mostly unexplored role of passive nociception. Passive nociception refers to the involvement of inactive nociceptors, by their presence and previous activations, in guiding conscious actions so that the individual performs them in a manner least likely to produce pain or injury. Inactive nociceptors may provide less-than conscious "nudges" that strongly encourage the avoidance of potentially injurious and hazardous exposures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;Baliki and Apkarian presented this explanation and differentiated the subconscious, unconscious, or preconscious processes through which nociception may guide behaviors from those more active processes that steer actions through the conscious and subjective experience of pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;Their results demonstrate the effects that an absence of nociceptive input may have in three poignant studies; the general disregard for injury seen in patients with painless channelopathies,&#x000a0;the self-destructive gait seen in patients rendered insensitive to pain due to leprosy,&#x000a0;and the boney destruction of weight-bearing joints seen in patients with painless Charcot joints of tabes dorsalis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;They postulate that the act of walking with proper gait, sitting with proper posture, or standing and stretching at regular intervals during long sedentary periods spent studying, are unconsciously motivated by nociceptive signals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;These&#x000a0;studies illustrate the various injuries that are possible in the absence of the protective nociceptive signals that protect the body from avoidable joint injuries, muscle spasms, or pressure ulcers that would otherwise be difficult to imagine in an unafflicted individual capable of perceiving and avoiding these injuries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r9">[9]</xref></p>

        <p>A final note is that while many electrophysiological studies have presented findings suggesting the vast majority of nociceptive fibers act in a polymodal fashion at all times, calcium ion studies have found that in vivo nociceptors often report only a single nociceptive modality, i.e., an Adelta-fiber reporting noxious heat but not noxious force.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;The inherent polymodal functionality of nociceptors and nociceptive nerve fibers may be an artifact of the trauma and resultant inflammation-induced when conducting the more invasive electrophysiological studies; the resultant inflammation has been thought to sensitize the otherwise monomodal nociceptive neurons and activate their polymodal activity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r5">[5]</xref>&#x000a0;Noxious stimuli can induce monomodal or silent nociceptors to become active and polymodal, and such activation may be a regular motif that gets mirrored throughout virtually all innervated tissues.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r7">[7]</xref></p>

<bold>Polymodal Nociceptors: Thermal, Mechanical, Chemical</bold>
</p>
        <p>Thermal nociceptive receptors are a subdivision of the transient receptor potential cation channel (TRP) family of receptors. Of the TRP channel family, which is composed of several ligand-specific subfamilies, the vanilloid variant (TRPV) is found in thermal nociceptors and is responsible for the transduction of thermal stimuli. TRPV monomers form tetrameric structures that contain a central pore through the cell membrane, and these tetramers may be homo-tetrameric or hetero-tetrameric regarding their composition of the four TRPV subunits. TRPV1 expresses on heat-sensitive C-fibers and TRPV2 is expressed on heat-sensitive A-delta-fibers; these receptors are the primary noxious thermoreceptors, they are stimulated at 40 to 43 degrees Celsius and 52 degrees Celsius respectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;It is important to note that these temperature-regulated receptors get dynamically set; while such high base-thresholds indicate inactivity under physiologic conditions, the temperatures necessary to stimulate TRPV channels may be significantly lowered during states of inflammation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r5">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r7">[7]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;The two remaining members of the family, TRPV3 and TRPV4, function at 33 to 39 degrees Celsius and 27 to 34 degrees Celsius, respectively. Taken together, the TRPV family is capable of detecting a wide ride range of thermal energy levels that represents a range spanning normal, physiologic conditions through to those that are noxious and potentially harmful.</p>
        <p>When TRPV1 and TRPV2 detect sufficiently high temperatures, they open and allow an influx of calcium, which depolarizes the neuron. Although TRPV1 and TRPV2 channels prefer calcium, by definition, they are non-selective cation channels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;Calcium-induced depolarization stimulates nearby voltage-gated sodium channels that generate an afferent action potential. In addition to detecting noxious thermal energy, TRPV receptors are also capable of detecting many chemical molecules, as well. TRPV chemical ligands include prostaglandins (proinflammatory), bradykinin (proinflammatory), capsaicin (natural product), anandamide (neurotransmitter), olvanil (antiinflammatory), resiniferatoxin (natural product), and acidic pH (protons).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;TRPV sensitivity to capsaicin and acidic pH illustrates the polymodal sensitivity of nociceptors seen in vivo and may explain why such stimuli share the sensation of burning.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;TRPV1 and TRPV2 are found throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems, as well as within the spleen and lung.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r1">[1]</xref>&#x000a0;TRPV3 and TRPV4 are expressed as TRPV1 and TRPV2 but are also present in the skin, sperm, and many visceral organs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r11">[11]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r12">[12]</xref></p>
        <p>In comparison to the amount of information known about thermal nociceptors, very little is known regarding mechanical nociceptors and the transduction of noxious mechanical force. Provided mechanical nociceptors, also called mechanoreceptors, function similarly to other force-sensitive ion channels, it can be presumed that these channels are present and expressed on the free nerve endings that have penetrated the basement membrane of the epidermis &#x02013; the unmyelinated nerve endings.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;As explained previously regarding thermoreceptors, the sequestered nature of mechanoreceptors in vivo has prevented their careful study. Much of what is known has been gathered by studying nociceptive neurons grown in culture. While such studies have identified several mechano-sensitive ion channels, the currents produced by these channels are both nociceptive as well as anti-nociceptive.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r3">[3]</xref>&#x000a0;Inhibitory mechanoreceptors, named TREK and Kv1.1, may play a role in keeping the threshold for noxious mechanical force sufficiently high to prevent overactivity of other mechanoreceptors, which is an idea somewhat analogous to TRPV3 and TRPV4 being responsible for lower thermal energy levels than TRPV1 and TRPV2.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r9">[9]</xref>&#x000a0;One final hypothesis, yet to be studied in mammalian tissue, is that noxious mechanical forces break the delicate nociceptive nerve endings, and the release of intracellular contents such as ATP and neuropeptides lead to inflammation, neural depolarization, and sensation of pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r3">[3]</xref></p>

        <p>Nociceptive neurons are a component of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). In this section, we will evaluate how a noxious stimulus detected at the periphery&#x000a0;is&#x000a0;transmitted to the central nervous system (CNS). It is important to note that somatic and visceral nociceptive stimuli reach the higher-ordered brain centers via different routes. As will be covered more thoroughly, the skin and organs of locomotion receive their somatic sensory fibers from the spinal and trigeminal nerves alone. In contrast to the singular route of somatic structure innervation, the majority of the viscera connect to the CNS via two distinct avenues. By using different neural pathways, the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system create the two routes for a visceral nociceptive signal to reach specific destinations in the brain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;Of the viscera, parasympathetic nociceptive fibers utilize specific cranial nerves, while sympathetic nociceptive fibers utilize either the communicating branches of the thoracic and lumbar nerves or a select set of cranial nerves.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r1">[1]</xref></p>
        <p>A further distinction comes from the modulation of nociceptive signals as they ascend towards the brain. While local signals may modulate somatic nociception all along the polyneuronal chain, it is the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord dorsal horn, the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, or several descending pathways that primarily act to facilitate or inhibit the somatic nociceptive signals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r1">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r4">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r6">[6]</xref></p>
        <p>This section will conclude with a brief but closer look at the previously mentioned polyneuronal trails that connect peripheral nociceptive nerve endings to the spinal cord, and then onwards to the brain. All primary afferent nociceptive nerve fibers project from their peripheral locations towards the spinal cord. If the primary afferent fiber is large and high-threshold, such as A-delta-fibers, it will project into the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This area is also referred to as Rexed laminae I and II.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;However, if the primary afferent is large but low-threshold, such as A-beta-fibers, it will instead project through the dorsal roots, eventually terminating in the deeper lamina (Lamina III-V).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;Both neurons synapse in their respective lamina, from there second-order dorsal horn neurons, carry the signal onward.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;Depending on the synapsing neuron's type and location, its signal will get carried by one of two possible types of dorsal horn neurons, those that are "nociceptive specific" and those that are of wide dynamic range.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r7">[7]</xref></p>

        <title>Pathophysiology</title>
        <p>Nociceptive neurons are dedicated to detecting noxious stimuli and alerting the brain when an injury is likely or imminent.&#x000a0;Since pain is such an essential&#x000a0;homeostatic mechanism&#x000a0;for preserving&#x000a0;health&#x000a0;and avoiding morbidity,&#x000a0;the person cannot easily ignore these sensations initially detected by nociceptive neurons or neural&#x000a0;circuits. When nociceptors, or their&#x000a0;secondary&#x000a0;neural circuitry,&#x000a0;are overstimulated,&#x000a0;they are capable of producing disabling sensations of pain and damage in otherwise healthy tissues. Often, the increased activity of otherwise-unaffected nociceptors is physiologic; such&#x000a0;is the case&#x000a0;when an inflammatory state may sensitize thermal nociceptors and allow them to&#x000a0;depolarize&#x000a0;upon contact with sub-noxious temperatures.</p>
        <p>Allodynia refers to a state where nociceptors have become&#x000a0;indiscriminately&#x000a0;sensitized, such that they&#x000a0;depolarize&#x000a0;in the presence of&#x000a0;sub-noxious stimuli.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;Regardless of the aberrant source of the nociceptive signals reaching the brain, the brain interprets the signals&#x000a0;as&#x000a0;allodynia, the unprovoked sensation of pain and damage. Allodynia is&#x000a0;distinct from&#x000a0;hyperalgesia. Hyperalgesia refers to a painful stimulus producing an exaggerated pain response well above the level of pain normally expected from such a stimulus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r3">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r4">[4]</xref>&#x000a0;Alternatively, "wind-up" is a measurable phenomenon present in nociceptive C-fibers, but not nociceptive A-fibers, where a small, moderately fast, a constant and repetitive string of stimuli produce larger and larger depolarizations of the activated nerve fiber.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;The&#x000a0;moderately high-frequency&#x000a0;stimulus increases the magnitude of depolarization by&#x000a0;maintaining&#x000a0;the nerve fiber in a state of partial depolarization; the membrane potential is much closer to the threshold for depolarization than the normal resting potential.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="article-25912.r7">[7]</xref>&#x000a0;Thus, each subsequent stimulus depolarizes the membrane to a greater extent than the last.
